Sthakathi Khumalo,"The currency debate "redriger Look Des was qualified & had relevant experiences. Thing is he was on the wrong side of deployment. Look at Jabu Mabuza at Eskom was hired by Jamnandas "redriger Look the finance sector is controlled by a certain cabal "Robert Russell My point was selective treatment bro Evidence is sealed when it comes to holier goats I do concede Zuma had his issues but we should maintain fairness when it comes to these things. "They denied rogue unit "makhosi nobhatyi The Zuma cabal refused to sign IPPS thats the actual truth bro "Pravin Gordhan is a real problem Alex Industrials You deserve to be blocked wena!! "makhosi nobhatyi The CR17 GOV has made more expenditure AND LOSSES than Zuma UNTIL today You don't seal anything without incriminating evidence hehe "This GUPTA narrative will run out of steam at some point "Andrew Coleman sell SAA assets Robert Russell WHITE!! Robert Russell The guy scored a handshake of 220 million after the sale of SAA planes that time SAA was making profits.. "No oe is defending Zuma "To be honest nhlanhla nkosi 😂😂😂😂 PROBLEMS OF CRAMMING NARRATIVES "Finally the the other side comes alleged* "redriger I am listening bro redriger I am actually Xhosa 😓 "ADV September a snack of note Elvis Malakoane The UPTAS were working with Duduzane and so who would you trust in this process as Nxamalala? "GUPTAS maintained dominance since Mandela times "They probably stole "makhosi nobhatyi OHO keep lying to yourself GUPTAS had influence during Mandela & Mbekis time Pastor J Give me your facts Guptas were friends of Thabo Mbeki; they donated to many to many organised events; had many business partners. The moment they were seen with Jacob Zuma - they were corrupt. Look comrades the GUPTAS BECOME THE PROBELM AS SOON AS THEY WORK WITH ZUMA "Y'all are referencing untested BOOKS what one may call propaganda "Thats a petty argument Pastor J Everyone involved in wrong doing must be given a chance to state their case and be examined. Whether its Zuma or CR17 or myself.. Pastor J The problem is you are not listening... I was making commentary on the books which are deemed as facts here but the veracity of their claims have not been volunteered to the commission! redriger How do you know that State capture started with Zuma? "Pastor J I have mentioned that fairness should be maintained We are listening attentively hehe Rasheed Ally Selective treatment in the country is at play here. Today we heard someone will be cross examined based on terms and conditions imagine! See you tomorrow people!! Let me go have some nice cannabis myself
Thokozani Waka Nkosi,"
Robert Russell,@Sthakathi Khumalo ....yes Des had relevant experience..... he bankrupted the Klerksdorp municipality just before he was appointed as FM.....and his brief was to bankrupt the country.... @Elvis Malakoane ...thank you Elvis.... but the facts remain the same @Pastor J ....don't forget the thug FLOYD next to him in tronk as well @Pheladi Lamola ...yes he did chow... he and his family had all expenses holiday to Dubai to the value of almost R700k...paid for by the Docrat family who won the tender... make of that what you want @Sthakathi Khumalo ....I can'r recall.... was Coleman Andrews black or white? "Wow...then he understood the concept of ""OFF Balance Sheet Financing""... @Sthakathi Khumalo" @Abel Matshidiso ....I think you might have a point....I'm not sure that MO is a Pro Golfer Try ZUMA @Rob Nel How are you going to teach that ethos to the ANC???????
Eliot Chauke,Jamnandas and Cyril are busy looting and setting up state capture... while people are still obsessed with Guptas and Zuma. "wena Pastor... when Zondo commission concludes The evidence is in North Gauteng High Court... Cyril said it must be sealed... @Redriger i said I support an African Child... and i vote EFF. dnt misrepresent the facts "@pastor the name of the judges "but dont worry @Pastor J i said North Gauteng High Court... @redriger u trying hard to be funny. @pastor u expect me to take u serious? vbs song😂😂. how much did eff steal from vbs and how @Pastor J. im saying the info is sealed. wat more do u want. the name of judges and amount received is sealed... I dont read Daily Maverick "@Pastor j b patient "@khumalo this is politics
makhosi nobhatyi,No stone will remain unturned "@ Khumalo you not stating the fact sir Gordhan and Eskom executives try to fix the damage left by Guptas "@ Khumalo yes we need to be fair but take away politics so you will see problem we are in as a country @ Khumalo you are too defensive brother as if you get your share 😂😂😂 but mna I am sober if CR is found guilty of wrongdoing we will deal with it later I cannot run around look what he has done Government is judged after 5 years sir what you see so far is Zuma administration not yet CR17 all he tried now to save our economy not to fall so stop lying here @ Khumalo "@ Eliot Chauke I am sober in mind I state facts but Khumalo defense is prematurely coz There is a problem with our ex president Zuma Zuma enjoys much back up from intelligent of Guptas to blind Anc as if there was people who want to chopped up him which works for him then but it couldn’t last longer here we are today heard how he.. @Sthakathi Khumalo please don’t lied these guys was nothing even to mr Mbeki only gained power by co operating system to enrich themselves and Zuma family by using Duduzane "@redriger @ Pastor J this is clear "@ dm70 you cannot just focus on economy without finding what went wrong otherwise every president will do as he or she pleases no one will asked @ridriger arm’s deal remember he still has share there Remember the book called “ The gate keepers “ it exactly what Khumalo did. No stone will remain unturned @ ridriger
Pastor J.J,@Eliot Chauke ...Is what you saying true? any evidence at all of your allegations.? Have you reported any of this to the authorities as yet? Just interested or possibly both and more @Eliot Chauke ...Mfuwethu wam....Still no evidence etc? @redriger ...The prevalent confusion pertaining to the individual is conclusive and evident. The higher standard in my language is intentional to create confusion to the reader. @Hloniphani Ndlela ...Be brave.Give me a single name of a Judge who has been paid money illegaly or in a corrupt manner. @Eliot Chauke ...sealed where baba.? @Eliot Chauke ...Eff must first release the VBS money for the poor to enjoy Christmas first. Skelms @Hloniphani Ndlela ...I agree with you that bribery of judges may have happened. You say it as a fact so give us a name. @Eliot Chauke ....Currently...VBS are the biggest thieves at the moment. Read Daily Maverick etc. Julius is going to Tronk in the next 3 months.4sure "@Eliot Chauke ...And when they unseal it and the page is blank @Robert Russell ..My apologies for seemingly having left him out. I normally call him Vetboy @Lorraine Naidoo ...Its difficult to send children to school when you have 24 of them and then stealing tap is closed. How did he afford it when the Gupta uncles where still here? @Lorraine Naidoo ...Thats what I thought Kanna "This Zuma and EFF nonsense is frustrating. Whilst they where and are busy stealing I pray that when Zuma gets his free issue orange jumpsuit that it will not have a zip in front. No baby 25 @redriger ....I tell you....It shows a lack of capacity by individuals to be constructive and factual. Thats my ineterpretation of the word itself @Elvis Malakoane ...A mess i dont mind. Zuma left a disaster worst than the recent tornadoes @Sthakathi Khumalo I fully agree with your last statement based on facts and not hollowed allegations prevailing. agreed @Rob Nel ...I know his handicap @funicanz ...You are absolutely right. And we have never been wrong about the credibility judgments we have made on this forum I am sure I just saw Adv Septmeber walking in her sleep again. @Elvis Malakoane Thats exactly what he said. hehehehehe @makhosi nobhatyi 1000% correct "@Sthakathi Khumalo ...You use the word ""probably"" and ""alledgedly"" so often that I am now convinced @Sthakathi Khumalo That cant be a get out free card. @#dm70.....hahahahahahaha.hehehehehe. stop being follish ZOBO? @Sthakathi Khumalo ...Do you believe that Zuma should be prosecuted or not??? we will talk about CR17 separately "So what is the problem with evidence being presented on him My questions are based on your comments before the book issue even started.@Sthakathi Khumalo @Sthakathi Khumalo ....You are unique and rare. The only one who does not know about the Gupta/Zuma corrupt relationship and how the other fools got drawn in like donkeys and goats. be real @Sthakathi Khumalo ...Inquiries and investigations is a process. one at a time. be patient Wassup @Roza essack .

Elvis Malakoane,yes facts are correct Narcissistic people remain strong in their point of view and like decoy pastor j Pravin Gordhan is hated because he chose the country over corruption and Cyril Ramaphosa can be called names but he stole no money Piet Rampedi is a clown that works with Iqbal Survy they looted money from PIC anybody who is clean gets vilified by most corrupt people no judge has been bought here that is a lie Cyril Ramaphosa spoilt the stealing fun now crooks are possess off with him this people are so corrupt and they hide behind lying and i tell you they have joint venture with the Satan Dudu Myeni and Brian Molefe are thieves the whole country is in a 9yr mess of Zuma administration with Guptas Robert Russell no story will replace Zuma corruption No right thinking person can defend Zuma mess pastor j yes and yet you see people clowning around with pseudo theories about Cyril and Pravin redriger true Abel Matshidiso I want to share your sentiment but remember he was behind Bulelani spy lie story Guptas must have given Zuma something to eat that made him soooo blind even not to see comebacks Guptas must have given Zuma something to eat that made him soooo blind even not to see comebacks sthakathi khumalo yaaaah neh ! cwele sthakathi khumalo so you are actually saying under Mandela they did not steal but under Zuma they got freeway to the purse agree with us sthakathi khumalo you must not block your eyes to the truth because you end up believing yourself sir I don't know how can people not see that Zuma presidency destroyed black middle class so you are saying Zuma was so useless people used his name to collapse the country with his son really guys who defend Zuma you are damaging him than helping him with your inuendos skhakati khumalo goodbye tomorrow sir
BanditZA,Eskom was a going concern "you poke holes in the ship then want to point at the crew after you jump ship "pls Mbaks i read all newspapers because i don't want to bias my views. leaders are born and arise to their position by virtue of the unselfishness of their actions. I'm not sure what strange concept of leadership you have "if your position is strong of thought. when you are hungry and without a decent existence you will resort to extremes and this is the situation we have. people with privilege need to acknowledge and share their knowledge but this intellectually bankrupt rhetoric is sickening refusing to read a newspaper! can you ever? as if your position is so weak that one article will sway you. are you scared?
Hloniphani Ndlela,Elliott Chauke you are ryt bro Pastor J is ignoring the truth which is happening now..CR emails..rogue..judges paid money..etc pastor J Google Peit Rampedi now..he was talking live on TV if there is no such Y can't they challenge him..being quiet is da proof he even said they must challenge him he's a available Cyril is stealing through WMC nd Pravin chose his business interests over the country..he was against corruption bcoz Gupta's were closing their..das how it works. daily marverick is for discrediting black leadership who wants to transform economy wait nd see da day Moyane cross examine Pravin
sihawu ntuli,can we all pray for our country which is destroyed by politicians
Sandile Khowane,Hebana!
Lorraine Naidoo,Zuma cannot afford his children school fees Paster he isloaded
enneth khumalo,"@Eliot Chauke why is eff not publishing it now I doubt there's any veracity about Zuma being broke @Sthakathi Khumalo What did the guptas do during mandela and mbet @Sthakathi Khumalo what did the guptas do during mandela and mbeki's tenure? @Sthakathi Khumalo so they only become corrupt once the met Zuma
Abe London,🤣
Derek Main,He should ask Duduzane to send some of his money from Dubai.
Pheladi Lamola,You're absolutely right @Robert Russel Cwele was a useless stooge. To whom @redriger? Oh I don't know @redriger. It was hard to keep tabs on what's happening during Zuma years Minister Siyabongwa Cwele He's matching with the tie Rob. 👌 Agree 100% with Mo. Too much power corrupts. I'm liking this Mo Shaik today. Cwele is going to have to come here and state his case. He's such a boring character but one will just have to grin and bear it through his testimony. Zuma was just president by proxy He should be charged with treason. A whole president prevented an investigation into the Guptas Zuma is never gonna return to the commission. He'll be chronically ill from now on. How is he going to deal with what Mo is saying? @Abel Mashitisho they're ending at 5. "Cwele's wife dealt in drugs and our ""intelligence "" minister was none the wiser. Go figure." It must have been a lot. Her accomplice was a Nigerian brother so you can imagine it was serious stuff 😂😂 In an ideal world that Gupta plane would have been shot down. That's how serious it was. Exactly @Sekgololo Johannes. People here defending the indefensible. I'm ashamed to say I have never read our constitution. 🙈 At least you read it James.
Thabo my 2pac Moloi my misc c1,Okay
funicanz,sithetha ngeyiphi minister @pheladi thank you zondo has been consisted. He listens and has patients. @redriger we follow this commission. credibility of witnesses we see it from far.

Raymond Mabilo,@kung fu kenny what happen to him
nhlanhla nkosi,lol water gate sthakathi is just the devils advocate here. arguing just for the sake of it Dm70 what does that have to do with the past 2 terms Zuma was in charge dm 70 did Mandela bankrupt SAA did Mbeki take money from eskom or denels Dm70 why waste time investigatin Mandela and mbeki for what Zuma allowed to happen
Waterbearer,I like the theory of “dependence creation”. Spot on
Judas Sambo,Spices
fred zulu,why don't we do an audit on the Zuma family before him becoming president and after
#dm70,"The issues about Zuma are history The commission is toothless and noone will go to jail and so what's the point. Only the poor do jail time. "Albert its a fact the Guptas have been around even in Mandela's time. People are only focusing on Zuma "Nhlanhla "James "Zuma took no money from any parastals
Albert Noah,@enneth khumalo. There is untested information that the Gupta brothers started their business during Mbeki era. @funicanz . The intervals are OK but I also think they should help the evidence leader by arranging a seat for the evidence leader. @Abel Matshidiso. Resuming at 1625Hours Maybe he lost his timekeeper @ Sthakathi Khumalo. Actually CR feared being fired from the ANC by the president. The main problem is giving too much powers to the Office of Presidency
James Godloza Godloza,@Elvis my problem exactly the Zuma protectors do not love their own country i really find it difficult to understand @Johannes and I will be the judge no trial for Zuma lol😂 lol @Governder when the president spoke they were scared to lose their jobs we should also remember Zuma is very clever he's got two heads Johannes Zuma made sure we don't have the fighter jet he stole that money with talles Mo bombshell that will shaik us Dankie Danie ons nodig bietjie grap ons het teveel klappe gekry van Zuptas
bongile sango,can any one inform chair that his time is wrong now he's like he is in other country because of his watch I think not so long ago DCJ advised us not to be in a hurry for conclusion of this commission
Isaac Mkhatshwa,"The reason why we can't get rid of corruption or get politicians to account are people who justify the unjustifiable "He is not unique but blind supporter
roza,hello danie maybe Mo wanted the curry recipe 🤣🤣🤣🤣 did sge get caught fir nyaope or rattex im sure that dudu was also busy with this drug story Granny u are right cowdung mixed with chilli powder

No president shud b the head of the intelligence services Zuma was born corrupt Pheladi it shud have been shot down. a fighter jet shud have been scrambled I detest such people. @james this country is in trouble. we have ministers who don't even know civilian planes are landing at airforce/military base.

Oupa Zwane,"Mo Shaik
Vish Govender,The concern here is that these guys knew something that was a threat to the state and didn't take it any further. Or is it their hands were tied because they could not challenge the President Zuma should be tried for treason to discourage others from betraying their countries.
