Eliot Chauke,Zondo is obsessed with President Zuma Elizabeth... im obsessed with who? R400 Million spent on this Commission... R0 has been recovered Not available until MarchüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ President Zuma is ill... under treatment until March. Zondo must stop this Hate... leave President Zuma alone. Vho Musanda. we all wana hear the other side of the story. however the Old man is sick and unable to attend. Zondo must allow him to recover Zondo is full of Hate . Pastor J... was de klerk really a president? Zuma wont come back
Please be careful,Just a reminder to not get caught up in hate that can be spewed by fake accounts "Stay safe folks. Enjoy the diversions Please don't let Siabonga Moloi get you riled up. Scroll to top to see how fake accounts work. Very likely to be a fake account with the purpose of trolling
An Empty Account,"This is another account
Crazy Sally,"And yet another account
Just another account,Seems a little bit silly that its so easy to create multiple accounts that can stir up arguments and create hate
An account that exists,"This account doesnt really exist but it does. As above
Annalie Elizabeth,Eliot Chauke‚ÄãZondo is obsessed with President Zuma - So are you So am I. He has to account Even the Shaiks threw him under the bus "Wow A leopard never changes it spots
Pastor J.J,I am also obsessed. Waiting for him to tell us one small bit of the truth for 20years now. Blessing to you@Elvis Malakoane Chaps. Lets ignore Siabonga Moloi or just delete and block him I am using something stronger this year. Mortein @Elvis Malakoane It is the Mortein @Bianca Arnold . It works. @Eliot Chauke ...Was Zuma really a President? Zuma and his skelm behaviour is making me sick. And I thought 2020 was going to be a better year. @Lex Luger ...My Precious friend. Blessings to you. Great to be back. All the very best to you and your family All these supposed trips to Cuba is becoming very suspicious. Possibly smuggling drugs or bringing back money from the Gupta buggers. The Zuma family must be extremely ashamed. A father for a thief. A few sons for thieves. Yoh Nkandla is on the map for all the wrong reasons. @Danie Nilsen ...The Doom wont work. We need something stronger Bro Greetings and best wishes to you my friend @Derek Main "Peter Moyo has lost his case against Old Mutual and is now ""Officialy Fired""" Perhaps @Derek Main This Commission is too lenient with this skelm. "@Lex Luger ...He may just well be very sick. Remember the comment on the ""shower"" It may have shown how wrong he was to take a shower and belive it works." @Derek Main ...Thankfully I still have the very old donkey attached to my cart. He will come as long as the commission grows a backbone and compels him. "Zuma will win an Olympic Gold for the ""duck and dive"" game." @Anne M. The bronze we will keep for the hones athletes "@Derek Main He moved 100million without proper process as a dividend A company he owns@Derek Main Does anyone remember or watched the movie Midnight Express and particularly the jail in the movie? Keep that jail in mind @Derek Main True @Elvis Malakoane @Derek Main... Quite frankly I care less if he was dead and in a coffin as long as he testifies and then they can move him to the prison mortuary for cross examination later.hehehehehe The NCP @Makwa Choma @Danie Nilsen "The ""NO CORRUPTION PARTY"" a.k.a NCP was started by the chatters on this forum. Lets all vote for them. hahahahaha" We already have President and Vice President. looking for Ministers now @redriger @redriger waiting for nominations. You are also on the list As corrupt as Malema and Shivambu stealing the poor peoples money from VBs @EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA ...No chance after what Malema and Shivambu did with the VBS money Well said @Elvis Malakoane @EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA ...have you been drinking something stronger than tea today? The EFF and the thieves who run it will be in jail this year. 2020. guaranteed. You have a better chance of marrying a donkey and the marriage being recognised in law than the EFF becoming government@EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA @Pule Pholoana Did the school bell ring early today?
Musanda Sikhwivhilu,I would like to hear Mr Zuma side of story. He must avail himself. it is better to spend all our money to unearth the crooks so we shall be free for life! The state must send him to their doctors to esfablish if the old man is indeed sick! yes Moloi! white previlege is real BUT our leaders messed up and are generally corrupt! Doctors of the State please Judge! mr Chauke! we need to hear his side of storry! All thieves must be arrested! We must not mix issues! Now is about State Capture! Mr Chauke WE have seen this with Shaick! Drs are not immune to fake news! The state must not be derailed! He was playing chess! Cant a person be arrrested without coming to the commission if that person is dodging.
makhosi nobhatyi,Zuma is running away now to answer questions The man was speaking at Nkandla saying he is healthy so what it is this ANC must account I agreey@ Makwa Choma
Thulani Bukani,All the best for the new year Mzantsi To you too @Bianca Arnold. "As crazy as it may sound @Derek Main so true. How can it be fair for him to keep telling us his eagerness and willingness to appear but always finds ways to duck and dive.
Phillip Cwazibe,"I have learnt to pursue my view @Thabelo Emmanuel ‚Äã Do you have the evidence that the Zondo Commission is influenced by the WMC ? Agreed with @ Elvis Malakoane. Judge Zondo is not influenced by anybody he is a reputable judge and human of integrity. There are allegations that must be refuted.
Wu GATSHENI Lo,Somebody please explain to me HOW Zondo is obsessed with Zuma.
Elvis Malakoane,Bianca Arnold compliments of the season Madam I missed you guys I see the president has amended terms of reference to force people to testify and answer questions not stage a comedy pastor j we have enough Doom this year let people behave or get it OK pastor j Danie Nilsen morning and compliments Danie true Itumeleng judge Zondo is not influenced by anybody he is a reputable judge and human of integrity Jacob Zuma sleeping dogs must be put down legally Jacob Zuma's doctor must be put on polygraph machine they stand there and argue peripheral issues just to waste time but looking at amended terms of reference last week his legal team told him that game is over Doctors letters Passport and polygraph machine for people who have no class and morals they see Zuma as a hero cos they are Narcissistic maybe 15min Ziyanda name of the doctor name of hospital and medical certificate and I repeat polygraph machine pastor j cursed very true Moses but a different ocean for the keys Indian ocean is not safe any developments I was off aur air smoke break again Anne M he pays himself cos gauteng high court annulled his agreement had with state I have maybe Guptas yes Shaikh is done with him Anne M your was very right Anne may she rest in peace mom pastor j I see Moyo lost against Old mutual appeal for reinstatement it is very confusing to me because they don't disclose exact source of dispute this lady is the one who spoke about Ambassador Kolane and and Gupta landing yes has he retired pastor j or the The pelican Brief by Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts not a lot just started commission will have to go to nkandla and work from there to make him testify and Mubarak was also very evasive till conviction is a person born a crook or it is something you learn or is it a form of revenge for disfunctional upbringing it's a complex personality nothing of this person is normal or honest true welcome party Nogal those guys were very racist Guptas bad that is why i am peplexed by his psychological state all is wrong around him and his name redringer he is pleading insanity which is also demonstration of heartleness not at all Make a Makwa Choma we make example for future presidents Makwa Choma that is my problem maybe Mashaba party pastor j am available for treasure post Peter Sant very true ANC played a very important role for our freedom But my mother or father has no right to abuse me because of she gave birth to me

Ziyanda Tshaka,"Hi guys
Kevin Simon,The Zuma bots on here are like the Flat Earthers. Despite the evidence. The evidence does require the ability to think conceptually. "Here is a thought Maybe Showerhead is going senile? Or does it sound like he may get better? NEVER thought I'd say this. Get Well Soon JZ. We need to see you in orange soonest. There were 4.8m tax payers registered in RSA last year supporting a population of 57 million as well as a bloated government. It can't last. Also I don't believe that the South African electorate understands just how many criminals they elect each election cycle. ALL is covered up by the oft repeated phrase of RET. "Derek Main . Surely a CEO is just an employee "Derek Main ‚ÄãTrevor Manual Yes I do. Where is the proof TM works for them? Ms G. Thanks. Dominic Przybylski ‚ÄãHeh @Peter Sant ! EFF is banking on majority of population thinking like a drunkard.. There is a growing population of people who believe in a flat earth as well!!!! This lady did not want to stir things up so she has narrowed her focus so as not to show she turned a blind eye and did not blow the whistle.
Moses Sowage,I said a while ago that this nkandla guy should be dragged to the zondo commission and answer all he has to answer they would have been done by now about Zuma "they must finish with this commission and take this guy to court and charge him and if found guilty they must throw keys to the Indian Ocean where no will ever find them
David Tuer,"I have never heard of a ""presumption of Integrity or a presumption of dignity"". I think the Commission should have its own medical team examine Zuma." It's obvious that Judge Zondo has never been in the Army !!!
Bonang Sithole,Zuma is nothing but a former president he must face the music of the comission that he established. thank you Zuma for Establishing the Zondo Comission
Derek Main,"If you still vote for the ANC Wonder if he can / will take it further? Let them put him on a stretcher and he can testify on his back. @Lex Luger Exactly - and look at how well that has worked for Shaik. It's a miracle!!! Seems like we need to take the law into our own hands to get anything done. @Thulani Bukani The justice system works for the criminals. They literally get away with murder. Next thing Zuma is going to tell us he doesn't have taxi money. @Anne M. Gaddaffi's gold There only reason Zuma takes so much flak about not appearing is because we have seen how he operates. The Stalingrad strategy. The lawyer invoking Ubuntu is rich - what Ubuntu did Zuma feel for the poor millions when he was stealing the money? @Pastor J @Elvis Malakoane I'm not sure what to think of the Old Mutual / Peter Moyo situation. Who do you side with? "Trevor Manual @Pastor J Dividend to himself? @Pastor J Hmmm - very suspicious. He must be an ANC member. @Concerned South African Do you know anything about the Rothchilds? @Concerned South African Look at Daily Maverick - an article by Richard Poplak dated 3 October 2014. He was appointed as senior advisor and Deputy Chairman of Rothchild South Africa. Koloane should be in jail for treason. @Pastor J Yes - I do. Read the book before I saw the movie. Horrific conditions - exactly what the state capturers deserve. I think we need to start taking away rights of certain categories of criminals. @Moeletsi Wabatho Just Zuma giving more lame excuses as to why he won't appear at commission. I say let him testify on a stretcher. His only valid excuse for not appearing is because he is dead. Seems like Zondo has not heard about Shaik. Zuma will never be well enough to appear if he has his own way. Remember Mubarak testifying from a bed in his trial - Zuma can do the same. @Elvis Malakoane Yes - the Egyptians got tired of the nonsense. When are we SAfns going to get tired of Zuma's BS. @Pastor J True that - he must testify even if he is dead üòÇ @Elvis Malakoane I like to think it's learned behaviour but I'm not certain. @Jacob Zuma No @Elvis Malakoane Yes - and yet the ANC had no problem with them. Just shows how you can turn a blind eye where money is involved. @redriger Snap! @Makwa Choma Spot on! The entire ANC is corrupt. You would think the voters are wise enough to see that but the idiots will still vote for the ANC. "@Makwa Choma Anyone but the ANC - unless you wanted to continue downward with criminals. This commission has shown what the ANC is all about - plunder - nothing more @Makwa Choma Do you know how many parties registered at the last election? About 50. You have a wide choice. "But if you keep voting for a party that is known to be corrupt to the core @Peter Sant Mandela's spirit has left the ANC long ago. @Pule Pholoana People who vote for ANY corrupt party are fools. I have no love for the DA. @Peter Sant I guess he never imagined how low they would sink. @Peter Sant Or the ANC. @Peter Sant I'm not stupid enough to be part of the ANC. "@SONGEZO MNCOKO Of course I do @SONGEZO MNCOKO So why not give them a chance and then decide? @SONGEZO MNCOKO It's not about persuasion - it's about corruption and feeding at the trough. @Peter Sant I voted for UDM but there are many choices - something like 50 parties were registered. Just definitely not a party as corrupt as the ANC. The EFF seem to be as corrupt as the ANC. "@Pule Pholoana ""you people"" Sounds a bit racist to me." @Peter Sant No - I don't go along with those BS quotes. @Pule Pholoana Racist much? @Kevin Aaah - the Ramaphoria argument. He's part of the problem. Where was he while the Guptas and Zuma were plundering? @Kevin NEVER trust a politician. Any politician. @Pule Pholoana Please show me where I used either of those phrases. @Pule Pholoana Reciprocating is racism.

Dominic Przybylski,Voters need to think beyond party and race. A governments primary purpose is law and order together with management of economy. Who would do that best? "Mashaba and Maimane are ambulance chasers. They pretend they'll lead by asking ""the people"" how to run the country. Cannot be a real leader by being a follower." Choice ultimately is between communism(social control) and capitalism(self-control). We need parties to explicitly state where they will take us. Then we can choose. Heh @Peter Sant ! EFF is banking on majority of population thinking like a drunkard @Pule Pholoana We need sex education. Far too many school girls end up pregnant. Kids need to know how to control their sexuality. @mgebe Sibula At least two thirds of EFF followers on Twitter are from outside SA. Is EFF's only opportunity to expand.
