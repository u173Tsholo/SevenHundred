Blake Yogi,Adv Siyabulela Mapoma Transnet vibes who is this evidence leader? "@Andy Sounds like he already choking on his own lies She laughed. oh woe Guys who can spell out that legal term? "Ask your ask "@fuzile He needs time. You never know what info he can extract. Let him have it🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ Dodgy wodgy😶😶😶 It already sounds like he is setting up a trap and a half Ayeye😱 Thats very strange:elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: A Mistake???🥵🥵🥵 The instruction that was there:elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: For the sake of completeness:elbowcough:
Johana Pietersen,.
Collier Marimba,RSAis going down the Zimbabwe way. Politicians gets the general public emotional to get a chance to loot. Shame!
Heather Durr,Who is this man Hofmeyer's Husband? @Andy Ahhhhhh always nice to have a fresh face to entertain us @Norman Mohakala I think Hofmeyer's husband must be a man of intellect and very secure in himself to have such a successful and outspoken wife "And Christopher Todd "HeHe These boilerplate clauses are the ones that fry you "@SanFran Arnold DCJ likes them to talk rather than read. It is easier to catch them . Hofmeyer and Seleka never read @Val Speirs MI6 as in James Bond (let me not start with my #conspiracytheories) "Covid has devastated sport.I am a tennis fanatic @Naledi Barron On 16 November there will still be court cases/civil war deciding who won the US election. And that will affect the global economy @H A L O A You read Freud??? DCJ is ALWAYS in a hurry to get to lunch
Andy,"@Heather he is one of the many legal minds we have in this country I must say whoever appointed these evidence leaders was very sober and picked the very fine and best this country has I expect this witness to be honest considering what is at stake for him as a legal person should he give false evidence under oath. "Yolo and Tshepo behave he has that Barry White 'how do you do my darling' kinda voice "someone must encourage these evidence leaders to come together and write a book about their experience at this commission @Yolo you killed me ooo okay now I hear you Zuma won't come to the commission he is book off sick for that week already. Brian Molefe will come testify and to top it all he'll simply cry to drive his innocence home read the amounts I want to hear how much of my tax was used
Norman Mohakala,Heather.. you sure his her husband
Joan De Beer,who is the Council for state
Mntase,Agree with Andy. I love these evidence leaders

Tay,Yes with a hoarse voice @Antoinette Meyer same here "Siyabulela means ""We thank you."" and is of Xhosa origin" DARK DARK DARK i don''t remember approximately but it was late in 2010 daaaah DCJ is indeed a sharp legal minded person TEA BREAK No one was looking at costs!

bella moholo,I can't hear this guy huuuuu... Berry White @Bavuyile 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Aubrey De Bliquy,@Jabu Malinga I think they have to introduce new evidence on the record of proceedings. Start 25 to 12 @Lee D. Hendrix Corruption is unfortunately our failure as humans. That is why try to have structures and law to mitigate it. @Lee D. Hendrix I think our young democracy has all the tools but increasingly lack the peoples champions to understand and advocate for the issues and use these Tools. @Val Speirs Afriforum is a inevitable player. Just one of many sides of a coin. Like most players nuance and truth suffers when we want simple answers. @SanFran Arnold This is why I refer to nuance as so vital. I was robbed on a farm while my two young children lay asleep. It was simply crime. My race and that of the criminals was irrelevant The same as the divisive issue of WMC. Monopoly Capital is an inherent potential problem as it is amoral by definition. Nuance is everything. "The thing is @Val Speirs Of course that in no way diminishes the pain of less fortunate victims. @fuzile dazana I am extremely proud to ive in such a thriving young democracy which sets an example to the world of lawful sovereign people's government. Mandela practiced law as did Ghandi @wim louw South Africa has the most proud legal tradition among the nations of the world. Even under Partheid the law was a limit on the excesses of Apartheid. @Jenny Whitewaves You can see when a witness has nothing to hide and gives 100% support. @Val Speirs I still want a full investigation of CIA and Apartheid government involvement in the assassination of Samora Machel. Our history books are often completely wring even of our history. wrong @Naledi Barron the list of wrong hings we hold to be true is breathtaking. Whenever I think of being a white in SOuth Africa I am gratefu I could have been black in America. "@wim louw I am sorry to hear you cannot forgive I want no jail on Robbin Island. Perhaps a shrine. A special place for us all to stop and consider where we came from and where we are going. This is their country. My late father told Prime Minister Vorster on of his apartheid swimming pools; It's the wrong Question. It is not do swim together? It's do we swim together or sink together? We are together. With modern technology of Skype. Zuma can talk to us today from his hospital bed under doctors supervision to help South Africa from his death bed. What patriot would do less? @SanFran Arnold Awesome idea. Bring Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii. Maybe she could inspire our own black Ghandi. This time more than ever needs a powerful inspiring leader of vision. @H A L O sports is so much more engaging for the soul than war and conflict and suffering. I don't want to humiliate Zuma more than he does himself. It is sad and embarrassing. For one thing I detest the ease with which everythjing becomes so racial simply by virtue of something which is by definition only skin deep. A pigment of the imagination. LOL "@Naledi Barron Yep Stop perving over Zuma's misfortune. It's taking the taste out of my coffee and I already can't take sugar because it kills me but I celebrate a country where I can lawfully smoke a doobee and speak the truth without it being a crime. Awesome rhyme sister @Valencia J I love it when you talk dirty @Valencia J You mean Zuma se butternutgat? LOL "Shame "Awesome @Immanuel  Who thinks South Africa is at least a 9 out of the ten best countries they I would love to be in? Get a room Guyzzzz Hehehe INUENDO "@Val Speirs Junk Status by the measure of fake Filure would be a choice. I trust those least who stand aound fantacizing about failure and throwing matches. @Val Speirs Please spare me the drooling over Covid19 numbers. 16000 deaths out of 60 million population. Your drool is showing. These lizzard brained parasites fantasize about being reincarnated as a virus to cull us useless eaters love to leave their trademark 9s and 1s on their handiwork to signal their kind to fall in line. Wake up call. Reality check. @Val Speirs We live on planet earth in Sunny South Africa. People copulate and have children who live and then die. about a half million a year to be precise. "16000 deaths is no more existential threat than AIDS or the common cold. Nuance is everything and the opposite is a lie in the vein of Bernays
Pastor J.J,@Eddie Reddy Its because we are too old or too young or otherwise suspended for some misdeameanour.hahahahha @Yolo More Do you see my chats? @SanFran Arnold Do you see my comments? @SanFran Arnold and here i was feeling offended that my greetings to you and the rest was being ignored. hehehehehe @BOIKANYO MOLOI Are you probably still asleep or perhaps the first troll for the day?

TheQueen V,who is the cheesekop of the day on the stand? hi peeps:yougotthis: thanx swty. @Val I think that's a bit much unless they get their own private protection and pay for it. In cape flats theirs no private protection for the innocent who dies everyday hey @zip did you just wake up now? 😂😂 "@Val protect yourself however you see fit looks like the lovechild of bheki Cele and Tokyo "agreed @Sanfran. I am also appalled and deeply saddened by this senseless killings "@Val absolutely don't sit back. Retaliate different to your oppenents. There must be other ways. I agree that enough is truly enough @zipreeper lol I'm not that bad😂 @zip true specially in a country like ours. @robben Island can be occupied by all these career criminals @wim I also don't forgive easily and I'm fine. I take my own time at my own pace. moeg om die minste te wees Carl is a fraudulent madcow lol even when he talks his a joke of note in the name of mkmva mxm "@mbuso are we having a share of the pie now? No "@HALO do you know the power of sport? It's one thing that unites this nation. So don't downplay sport. there's a reason it's now subdued "@mbuso it's people like you that make us never to move forward and prosper. Why can't we sit at the same table and eat together. Why must we eat in phases "@HALO no one else seems to care about us. look how selfish our ""leaders"" are just sorting themselves and their families and children. so let us love ourselves and our needs. we don't need to plz you" @HALO you can Karen all you want. Let us also have a point of view. Thanx have a great day "@Manelo if you want to play @donovan unfortunately we don't have true leaders only a bunch of greedy thieves voted in by stupid voting cattle @Rox nothing why? "@Aubrey @rox that embicile said Zuma did nothing wrong. mxm "@HALO that's you exactly. Can see you won't stop either. I even greeted you on our departing comment to show no hard feeling but eish @HALO men think they are in charge. Woman run this mtf.... watch yourself boy. Woman are not here to stimulate you.

Val Speirs,We should offer private protection services to farmers. We will take out the killers before they can do anything. land was purchased and not free if you want land then pay for it. Afriforum and the farming community will ask overseas sponsors for assistance. The solution is to be forearmed and forewarned. "The criminal are inciting violence @ Aubrey. Aubrey you should count your blessings So Aubrey you say it is okay to trespass on private property and invade ones home. When the SADF tried to invade Lesotho they were taken out 🤣 The Doc is old school and looks like an honorable man. Aubrey you should ask M16 Manelo...you must be joking TRUMP VICTORY 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣0️⃣➖2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣4️⃣ I don't need to spark a dube to speak the truth. Ooops here we go I wonder if the duplicated payment was reimbursed?? Sounds dubious Aubrey..South Africa is a beautiful country in a junk status and riddled with crime so I give it 0 out of 10. Aubrey ..our economy is at an all time low and was before the Chinese communist virus was unleashed. Aubrey ..I am not giving you statistics only a fact. @ Aubrey..therefore the economy and unemployment in your opinion was at it's worst before the Chinese Communist Virus. Aubrey ..you look like a fake professor of nonsense Aubrey..what has that got to do with our Junk Status??
