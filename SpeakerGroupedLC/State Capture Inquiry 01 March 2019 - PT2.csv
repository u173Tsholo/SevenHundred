M T,"I’d really like to know why McBride was booted "This stream is constipated once more "#Welton - LoadShedding is their ploy - to get us to cough up more! They can get stuffed! I’d like to know who is on the payroll Can’t even refer to it as “Daylight Robbery”! Where is the Lifestyle Audit Squirrel so bravely but purely eluded to - simply for lip service? Mxm

KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,.. "This is boring
Ntombethemba Manase,This one is protecting others. Ligwala eli. "He understands all the questions I hope there is no implicated person willing to cross examine him. yes After Eskom its gonna be other SOEs. "No Sthakathi "Anoj No the authority was with the CFO. Yes. He is clean. He even went to the national treasurury to mpimpa the captured ones. And the national treasury did not approve this contract because of him. So angelic. He does not deserve this.
Thabang M,why is the sound lowered?is it load shedding?
welton paulse,jirrrrr....this guy doesnt understand the question "on the flip side. eskom doesnt like competition Mr chair seems as if everyone at Eskom was doing his own thing "@ Moira T "Our government needs to be taken to court thats confirmation that he is working for Eskom....no freaken clue what he is talking about
Mhlekase Leepile,ANC stop exposing each other.
Wildthing,Leepile you should rather say. ANC start doing things by the books and within the rules. not hide criminals. he meant Venezuela bonswa or bonjour hope some people will get the nice silver braclets on both arms soon. faster the better you mean Uber bye

Eunice Molete,.
MIKE DURBAN,Eeeesh....all around the world....... Mmmm.....China....Russia....North Korea....etc etc Those are our Bra's now...... Oh Yeah.....Johnnie will do thanks...
Benny Moja,Kanti there is Part 2? Need to grab some popcorns for this few minutes remaining... 😉 cab someone balance real quick... i'm trying to catch up here... is Eskom the focus now? *can Hmm... i think ama need to a cup of coffee for this one... @Anne M. say no more... i'm listening to the figures... i think ama need triple espresso. So the guy on the *Hotseat is he in the same position like Agrizzi? Is he a whistleblower or they called him for questioning? "Great stuff Kanti this figures are real banna??? @Nelson Musoliwa ... and on top of that they have the audacity to blame apartheir when it comes to load shedding.
Magda Seguin,The CFO who was Anoj Singh Treasurer did not have ultimate signing power No...did you listen ??? the CFO is the executive and he only can sign @Ntombethemba 👍 He is still in the same position Not with the Gupta /Zuma captured agents... He had no negotiating power at all... Next week Eskom is still on the agenda at the commission All due to one man...Zuma who allowed the Guptas to loot Noam Chomsky write a great book called 'Failed States'....SA was on the brink of what he describes Dateline in progress🙃 Sofia you guys are cute together "@Sofia Sofia you are right @Sofia Sofia I agree he is handsome and honourable.. @jeeva singh 😊 I live in Paris....it's true Living in France is easy We have no electricity problems...we have underfloor heating and our bill comes to only €26 monthly I think a kota is less than a euro...look up Flunch on google...it is the best local fast food chain My heart is in SA A long time....I come and go regularly...dual nationality Bonsoir @ Willem It's already afternoon bonjour is earlier It is 15:15 Here at present you are an hour ahead Hello to you too😊 She heard you have a wife already 😄 The only thing is there are no SA products like Marmite or chutney Provita and Pronutro @Maud N about 8 to 12 euros Lots of chiskop here No I mean here in France It depends @Maud N how you live and how much you earn The transport system is extremely efficient and cheap Have a great weekend guys

Nelson Musoliwa,Seems like Eskom was run by ghosts not human beings huge sum of money milked by crooks that it nearly collapse the economy completely. Eskom debt did nt arise from economic negative condition but from human deliberate looting. The big question is who are those people;zondo comm will help answer this question
Ntuthuko Sibiya,Can you please shut down South Africa
Peffershirley,Nearly Collapse?LOL Not Just Zuma looks like more hands were in this bag. Innocence Proclaimed So you first have to engage a company and then register. that so funny """Contracting period"""
Derek Main,@Peffershirley Of course - we know that. The entire ANC is on trial here
Jabulani Sithole,We know the thieves The problem is they are busy chawing the $ and by the time we want to recover the bank balances will be negative -1
Opo Opo,Btw SA stopped sending money to Zim... So excuse of helping other country is out.
Welcome Nhlanhla,@Nelson Musoliwa so if this is possible that there are people with such agendas its obious that if SA is poor it someones purpose. she challenged you privately now uyabaleka @jeevan singh
mogamat noor Davids,"Singh
Buyiswa Mnyani,I don't know the benefits of unbundling but what I know is that Julius is against it bcoz he knows Eskom is government's big bank and he is waiting to get his hands in the cookie jar of Ramon.
Willem van den Berg,"jeevan lol jeevan Hello over there Magda 😃 she went grocery shopping in Paris 😉 lol i bet bring own Cobra polish lol same to you Magda and everyone 😃
