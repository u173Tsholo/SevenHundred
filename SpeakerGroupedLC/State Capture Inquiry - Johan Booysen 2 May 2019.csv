Kay Kay,general Booysen is very smart Booysen's racketeering charges is really coming to hunt Jiba the snake Zondo must plz drink water That coughing by Zondo thou This state capture is actually not a normal corruption saga but a syndicate of organized crime "@Michael Wild Is she leading the evidence for the first time or what? State capture syndicates plan it so well that nothing come out b4 Zuma's presidency come an end And the ANC politicians allowed themselves to be used to cover and protect all the crooks and looters of state resources So Richard Mdluli pledge to cover Jacob Zuma's back? "Zuma influenced and corrupted majority of the ANC leaders Now I understand why the ANC Zuma faction didn't want CR to be come president and have decided to plan for his removal "@Norman Zwane Jiba&Mrwebi can challenge the justice Mokgoro report if they want to waste their money "@Solly 12 So advocate Nko lied to the panel in her quest to want to become NPA head?

Magda Seguin,@Robert Russell I have been listing to application to the Concourt hearings for the elections to be postponed The Khoisan have been marginalised and requested an urgent appeal for an independant represebtative in parluament due to the fail of the ANC to address the issue for 25 years "It is spring here in Paris
Nelson Musoliwa,Had Bootsen been appointed as national police commissioner many of the state looting could have been prevented not Ntlemeza of this world. Inconceivable that the R2m which was witnessed by several police officials and hard cash as exhibit plus telephone evidence yet case provisionally withdrawn Wonder if Zuma is still asking if the state was captured as he refereed to the three tiers of state. @Hank correct we are all corrupt in this country Me think it is in our DNA which only need to be ignited by being given power of controlling state resources. But yes i may be wrong So far evidence in zondo comm exposed stupidity that engulfed the corrupt individuals including the baba ka duduzane Nathi Mtetwa was bidding favors with zuma and to cover his role on slush fund used to fence his private home unlawfully. he is corrupt Kay you are 100% correct
Kapn Krunch,all institutions pretty much are let's face it that's false we are not all corrupt those in positions of power are but when majority is corrupt it's hard to stay alive when you do the right thing
Sthakathi Khumalo,"Is this the same fellow who refused a 2 million bribe..?? But why did under this guys leadership That cough by Zondo reminds of Skhumba saying cabanga umkhulu wkaho kuthiwa uyashona.... "Ae wavelelwa uZuma September is septembering us hey!! but she should learn shame "So tell me something people "Derek Main Thanks bro!! Eish But Isn't Mwrebi and Jiba challenging Mkgoro report?? "Norman Zwane They are represented by that Tsotsi Majavu even... I wish they would come here and get Adv Maleka and Zondo in action
welton paulse,Eish mara when Zondo clears his throat it sounds like Thunder somewhre in JohannesburgüòÅüòÅ "Eish Zondo sounds sick @Norman Zwane......or he must Vote ATM...bathong They must give him Vicks vapo rub "@Norman Zwane  "I am telling you Hlaudi bugged the Chair's microphone "chair reminds me of my late great grandmother
Norman Zwane,@Sthakathi Khumalo Mzilikazi kanti ubuye ulalele lesisigebengu saseTembisa uSkhumba? @makhosi nobhatyi Amahlathi aphelile koJiba. Their circle is just diminishing in multiples. "@welton paulse I thought I was the only traditional consultant here Paulse "@welton paulse So wena ungenaphi? The judge must just slaughter a goat and his ancestors will tell him to vote Cope @welton paulse His ancestors went before ATM. He vote ATM we will be talking about a former judge. "All these people who are implicated need to come together "@welton paulse Hlaudi's T-shirts are causing quite stir in Qwa-qwa Mthethwa here Mthethwa there Mthethwa all over the sickly evidence of Booysens. What was wrong ngo Nyambose? H L A W U D I üó£ Ms September if she was black would be a very beautiful girl. @makhosi nobhatyi No wonder the hall is half empty today. Batohi is in the house? @makhosi nobhatyi Not my kind of black @makhosi nobhatyi Are you looking at anything else either than Ms September Nobhatyi? @makhosi nobhatyi Ngikubona la esibukweni sami @Od Mod I think they kick you out if you are NOT corrupt. Sello Maema not Sello Malema @Kay Kay Scary stuff I tell you @makhosi nobhatyi They would be planning suicide if they came here. "@Sthakathi Khumalo They have been advised to challenge by no other than Zola Majavu who advisec Ntlemeza. Hlaudi @Kay Kay Can you imagine how she must sh*tting bricks right now for that 'little' lie.?
Thapelo Motabogi,karima brown
funicanz,"Can someone please bring Bostol for our Chair DCJ has been irritable since she started leading this evidence.
Sebation Nantsika,Can you please call hlaudi‚Äôs name
delphin yvon Moukouma Mboussi,Malema was willing to kill for Zuma Kiss the boers
Wildthing,is Jiba on her way to jail yet. Zuma to follow her to Jail. the sooner the better. Think Zonda is under a large amount of pressure. he has worked with the people he is now hearing about there wrong doings and will need to take action to sentence them soon. ha ha another bomb just gone off. respect to Judge Zonda for calling out the full rank of Boysen he is showing respect. Pilliy go play somewhere else.with your Pilli will enjoy bye you blocked There is one she can get. sweeping the floors in Jail. state pay and all. but behind bars. I hope Judge Zonda gives LG Boysen the right to arrest each one that was involved in all this corrupt action.
Raymond Fitzgerald,the judge is just fantastic who cares if the poor man has to cough
Henk van Anraad,I think he is trying his best
Siyabonga Dladla,@Kay Kay and she seems to be bringing a lot of irreverent info to this commission...I think that's why the Chair is a bit irritable today
douglas gwambe,kay kay ANC is corrupt Anc is corrupt not individual the in tire organization Derek main 88% of corruption is from AFRICAN NATIONAL CORRUPTION.
peter sikoshule,"Anc is not individuals
Derek Main,"@Sthakathi Khumalo If they want to clear their names. If they don't testify here @douglas gwambe Too true. The ANC has corrupted all levels of government - from parliament to ward councillors and everything in between. Corrupt to the core. @Sthakathi Khumalo Let her try - then they can grill her. @douglas gwambe I agree 100% ANC - The Poephol's Choice @makhosi nobhatyi They will be torn apart if they do. @Kay Kay She said it was unfair and she stood by her assertions that she was furthering prosecutorial independence not hindering it. She is waiting for parliament to debate her removal. Ramaphosa stated that Jiba could not be given any public service job.
Solly 12,Remember Jiba was already facing charges that were dropped by Shaun Abrahams on the day she was meant to appear in court You can read Jiba‚Äôs response to her sacking by Ramaphosa on the presidency website Kay Kay she criticised the report saying Mokgoro made elementary mistakes & requests Cyril to redeploy her to another state institution Ryan John I‚Äôm going to block you
Od Mod,corruption is a way of life in the ANC
Thabiso Itumeleng,he he he he chickens have come back to roost. "Either way the elections goes
Richardt Human,Wonder what the polls will demonstrate next week

Siive Tyolo,what is going on?
Born free,Is it any wonder that the rand plummeted and South Africa was declared a Junk Status.. thanks to Zuma and his comrades of corruption. Ryan are you inviting hate speech? There are legal implications for inciting hate speech.. Ryan I won't pretend to support EFF.. I don't support the EFF thugs. You think not.. your incitement will be referred to Afriform Ryan your messages have been copied as proof of hate speech. Incriminate yourself some more Ryan.. Why would you have to fear whites what is your problem? Ryan don't lower your standards to that of the EFF sorry my land belongs to Nedbank free everything.. honestly where is the money going to come from? You will have to qualify for a bond EFF stole from VBS which is poor black people's retirement funds All whites would have taken their money off shore to safer destinations Yes that's exactly what that EFFING party will do All aboard the Titanic = EFF All should be forewarned that the EFF have stolen from the VBS and this is just the beginning Ryan you can't be serious Yes Yvonne I agree all Malena's promises are absolutely unrealistic and would be fateful for this country.
Auti Mjita,"These white people pretending to be EFF supporters are boring really you will not convince anyone of you fake farm murder drivel...instead you are showing the world what you really are. ball-less imbeciles who cower behind anonymous accounts to troll public platforms...disgusting! @Val Speirs He is Afriforum boet! there has been an increase in such accounts recently..all operated by right wing orgs...we know this
Jane .Blamire,report and block him
Yvonne Morudu,ryan John I wanted to join EFF but I realise am not educated your president hates uneducated people no Julius was calling someone stupid from Limpopo bcz he is not educated... I don't qualify to be in EFF am not educated "imagine Juju being the president the economy will collapse within 2 days.. a dictator EFF is nothing but a dictator of note he will bring this country to its knees . he said he will encreas the economy with about 6 percent within 6 months... 702 asked him he couldn't explain the sad part is that he is lying to ignorant supporters I did not meaning am not accepted?
