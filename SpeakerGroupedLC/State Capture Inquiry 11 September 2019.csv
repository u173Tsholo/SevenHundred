Jane .Blamire,Morning Rubin. I think he actually believes his own explanations. The mentality of the man is astounding! Andre did you know? 😀😁🤣😂 @Hloniphani Ndlela Fake news Mushavhi Mulungu.....go away
Pastor J.J,"Cloudy Hlaudi reminds me of an old saying...."" If you play soccer in the dark @André du Plessis Very poignant and true. @Tshwane Smoke Because the only person we see on the chair is Hlaudi. @Lex Luger @carnoth ngomane I totally agree with you both. @Lex Luger Blessings. Always my friend @Hloniphani Ndlela What utter nonsense. Do you perhaps have any evidence thet the NDPP was bought by WMC??????? @Jack Sparrow Very true indeed. @Hloniphani Ndlela And that was denied by her and not proven otherwise. Does that make any sense to you? @Thando Nkutha My friend....Clever compared to what? @Jack Sparrow Very true. I have done thousands of sermons and written many more thousands. It will never make me the Pope. Is GNH (Gross National Happiness) as important as the GDP.?????????????????? @Gee Peex1 No. I disagee with you. What might happen though is that E might become a K or the F becoming an M. Its just a Hlaudi thing I think @Jack Sparrow Perhaps a few short circuits as well........
Peter Davids,hands off Hlaudi
André du Plessis,"WBS on 6 Dec 2013. A guest speaker does not make an academic. At no stage has Mr Motsoeneng lectured at WBS "can i remind everyone that the 20 years
th do,andre your white
Francel van Eeden,th do what does it matter if he is white or not. the truth is the truth so stop been racist and biost lets get behind the truth and let the law run its course Born free I tend to agree with you but the question is did he use his talent in the right way @Brian looking at the law of averages it means that the population split is more or less 10 to 1 so it makes sence @Tshwane Smoke so because of that should everyone then now be authorized to lie Seems like today is going to be dominated by race issues again not human beings but racists Born Free I watched your comments over the past weeks. You are an extraordinary person that are very informed and very sensical. well done my friend The bigger picture regarding qualifications means only one thing. It proves that people misused their powers to apoint their friends I know about a lot of white people in senior possitions which were caught lieing about their qualifications. they were eventualy dismissed and I totaly agree with it We had a president that never had even a single High school subject passed. He made a mess and we all suffer yet the population support him in his corrupt ways and blame someone else
Born free,But Hlaudi had talent 🤣 "Talent can get you further than a matric certificate  @Francel.. obviously not because his talent was probably talking a lot of nonsense over a loud speaker "I can't find my S Level certificate so it will always be ""Outstanding""" "Hlaudi has an "" Outstanding""matric certificate 🤣" You must pay for land. it is not free nor has it ever been free. Realism SABC-had catched big fish in me - Hlaudi 🤣 Forever 🤣🤣🤣🤣 The banning of da Benning was for the benefit of the ANC so they would not seem ungovernable. Surely the Public has a right to know what is happening in their cities and to what extent. It's a reality why hide it. But yes I agree that there must be dignity in death regarding the Benning of an individual. I don't want to see a person Benning Shame yes all those poor souls Benning in the Twin Towers.. it was horrific Dino.. CNN showed people Benning and jumping from windows of the 911 attack. There is so much violence and Benning that we have become accustomed to it. "The ""Act"" is unlawful ?" 🤣🤣 "He did not comply with his little book of the Act. He misinterpreted the ""Act"" to suit himself and it was ""My Way Or The Highway""." No compliance with statutory laws. He is pathetic. "He transformed the ""Act"" which he cannot do." He was in breach of the Act. He thought he was the Master of the SABC He does not understand the Act in the small booklet Commander in Chief of SABC
Margareth Waterboer,Block any racist..I just blocked @the do The man is delusional The man has created a new word...glamouritizing..He must have learned that from WITS students...😂😂😂😂🙈
lethabo moepya,can we start They are running late again morning tlotlo No the accent is not south African "No rox DCJ can we proceed. "Am afraid we will have to wait a bit longer ok the man is back now "even after being corrected that it's glamourising
funicanz,Morning everybody. Lomuntu uyazizwa ma ekhuluma?🤔 "Hlaudi agrees with Chair's thorough explanation yet he hardly agrees with Ms Norman's questions. He agrees with everything Chair says. ""#in hind sight""" "Hlaudi knows his story whether right or wrong. He remembers everything and things went accordingly as per his understanding.@Thando Nkutha  At least he is being honest now. Yes I did.... He differentiates between decisions and policies. Haaa this guy. He understood a lot in his tenure. So we are not thinkers la eSatafrika. "@welton paulse  witnesses.
Keith Hadden,probably a meeting in chambers
MaseSeun VanGauteng,Hlaudi is a living example why education is necessary!
Glorify Gumede,wangena umfoka Zondo madoda please we here for Hlaudi not the lawyers Where is Hlaudi ? these people @Rox Moleme i doubt i hear Shonglish there perhaps naturalised really? why? @Lex Luger if he is Venda than what is the matter? If he is Shona than what is the matter? explain why is Xhenophobic that Zondo sounds Zunglish? @Lex Luger you must think before making such claims i know its fashionable to use big words these days just to sound smart @Lex Luger i am of a different view and everything must be contextualised. Perhaps if you are black you will understand the word Zunglish i bet you are an armchair theorist and looking at issues from the academic point of view but that is fine "i don't know what is wrong with that guest lecture public lecture at Wits perhaps Wits must just relax just like the Guptas everyone is denying working with them these days @Lex Luger lol he went as far as capturing MultiChoice Anyone who think Hlaudi is stupid has not listened to him attentively he is not a liar and that is one think i appreciate about him. He gave us the name 'Swanepoel' lol i like this guy lol Most academics will tell you that things can't be done and end there but Hlaudi will do and explain why a decision is taken @thando cezula not just at the SABC but in spaces where change is needed @thando cezula i know people who manipulate things including the country's currency so i won't rule out that with SABC local content ? why is this one not given the same attention Hlaudi understood that this was beyond LSMs but economics and key to the livelihood of local people and productions This is a phenomenon that has engulfed social media in general where people will post visuals without any warning or consideration for viewers
Vic SetheMasewawatla,Here we go Zondo ke bosso.... No video paly day "We have a white lady working with us as a Legal Administrator with std8 Hlaudi is more clever and smart more than most people with degreees.. I have seen stupid educated fools... "@Lex Luger He even attempted to have his own political party in parliament "Hlaudi is very grounded and respectful "@Maboko Shadrack Seshebedi He was head hunted I can't can Understand kwaaaaaaaaaaaa adapt "A lot of us a faced with that mentality in private sector that says @Khanyi. AgeGracefully Please stop Jokitizing Hlaudi @Khanyi. AgeGracefully But it was funnysizing But Adv Norman said Haludi's testimony will take approx 2hrs./....mara we are still here 5 hrs later

Sam Mkhwanazi,ukusalayo he lectured all those clever blacks at wbs if you have mba from wbs you were helped by Hlaudi
Moeketsane Sethojane,i agree with you Zama i think underestimating this guy is a big problem. we comment like we are the ones without matric. listen to this guy and judge him based on what he says because all this other things seem to be bias "i agree with you Glorify.. this guy knew his job  "look at the people who are watching this guy and then understimate him by his matric.... this guy is a guy of practicality  @Mduduzi Xaba i know a lot of white folks owning some farms and failed matric dismally but have a lot of millions and even give me some transport when i come to school and drop me at my room
Khaya Nomoyi,Now he is gonna see why he needed tertiary education not to play around with policy and dictate his own policy in News coverage. He went overboard to protect the image of Zuma by interfering with News coverage policy.
Sihle Menzi Ndzimandze,He is angry So there are students who are graduates and where taught by Hlaudi and studied the notes they took

Derek Main,When is he going to tell us about him illegally increasing his own salary? @dada ngova As long as that reality is one where the ANC is no longer in power. @dada ngova Are you still peddling that old lie? The entire ANC is responsible for the mess SA is in. What about collective responsibility? You can't pick and choose when it applies. "@Thando Nkutha Then I'm a fool. This is exactly the argument the NAT government used for their censorship of covering protests. The more things change @Thando Nkutha It's he truth isn't it? @dada ngova SA will only recover when more people use their votes wisely and don't vote for a party that is corrupt to the core and only interested in filling their own pockets. Wake up man! "@Thando Nkutha To me @Jack Sparrow I wouldn't be surprised. Never trust a politician. The only thing our government responds to is a riot. Is it possible that Hlaudi and the ANC didn't want these visuals to be seen because they didn't want people to see how badly they were governing? The problem is that destruction during protests is the only thing that makes the government sit up and take notice. "@Gee Peex1 From what I've read @Gee Peex1 Exactly - so then it's no longer xenophobic - it's just plain old violence. @Gee Peex1 And that's because people are frustrated - no other avenue is available to them for their grievances. It's a last resort. "@Gee Peex1 Like I've said @Gee Peex1 I think you'd be hard-pressed to find many who will admit to being Nats. I disagreed with just about everything they stood for. It might explain why so many vote ANC - they are so similar. @Gee Peex1 I'd be interested to hear what you agreed with. "@Trevor Gerntholtz You mean ""glaramarizing"" - it's a Hlaudism."

Sizwe Zuma,Our views expressed about Hlaudi are subjective to the background of what is been said about him. in search of the truth you will have to use an objective mindset. his decision not to show visuals in informed by the act. the statement read alone suggest otherwise but if read in the context of the act that governs SABC it makes sense. "how can you call someone stupid @Derek Main that excuse is an insult to your own intelligence
