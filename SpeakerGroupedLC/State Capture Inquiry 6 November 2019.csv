Yolo More,Who is the witness today? Thankyou Slie. I hope they are not too ill to come before the commission. Thanks Pastor J. How I wish Adv Kate deals with Manyi decisively. Lex Luger Maleka decided to leave. "Lex Luger "Yes Luger "Pastor J "Manyi is a coward "He is ""too ill""" Thando Nkutha you see him mos. He is not type of a guy who would fight tooth a nail. He is Maimane type of a guy. "Yes chair
Slindile Ngcobo,"former Director Generals of GCIS
Pastor J.J,@Yolo More GM. I think Mzwanele Jimmy Manyi and Themba Maseko. Both repeats i HOPE SO TOO @Yolo More And we have Tannie Kate. "@Lex Luger @Yolo More . You are correct DCJ limited and restricted him excessively in interrogating the evidence of Jimmy ""Naughty Boy"" Manyi. It seems that was the reasoning of the fallout." I think that when Maleka was restricted he should have pulled out the Sjambok and sorted this Jimmy thingie staright away. Hahahahahaha @sechaba Montso Waiting at the Jail gates for admission. In the meantime the Tailor is measuring him so they will make him a free new suit. A orange one @Richard Nyila ....But he could have taken a shower for the flu as well. He said that the shower is the perfect cure for everything. Shame on him for still ducking and diving. "@Francoise Phillips The same skelm who was Shabir ""Tiger Woods"" Shaik""s Doctor. Buggers" @Shane Aniruth The Landlord is an implicated Party "BREAKING NEWS.......The CMA ( Comrades Marathon Assoc.) has confirmed that Jacob ""Zoomer"" has been given automatic entry into the next race. Apparently he is the Greatest ""Runner"" ever." @Derek Main hahahahahaha. @Dan Brown Check your device and volume settings. The volume has been 100% great since the start @Mbuso Ndlovu We changed that Theory for Zuma....GUILTY until proven innocent @MIKE DURBAN Or a blerrrrry hottttt Durban bunny.Even kills the most severe diseases. who needs a shower if you can have a durban bunny @MIKE DURBAN ...And the hot hot veggie and chillies pickles. You I am salivating now @Diss & Dad Blessed day to you my friend. I also remember you talking about the book months ago. Is it availabale as an eCopy? @Suzie Greer Is Julian still facing a charge of rape? @Derek Main . I am confused. He holed up in that embassy to avoid extradition on that charge as well as the US charges relative to the Wikileaks issues. I need enlightening Yoh. All that misery at the embassy because of vindictiveness and anger of some Govt or another. What a messed up world we live in @Diss & Dad I am going to try and get a copy ordered. Thanks always for the very valuable insight and info that you share with all of us. I appreciate you my friend. "I always had great difficulty in understanding but more so respecting these so called ""Democracies"" being the US and UK. I see more and more hypocracy rather than democracy that they preach" @Aj Otto They absolutely are. Cosatu is a member of the Tripartite alliance. Ramaphosa was also the Gen Sec of NUM
skeetpetegibbs,WHEN ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING TO START ON TIME. SORRY I FORGOT....THIS IS AFRICAN TIME. Just started and she wants to adjourn already.
Derek Main,@Yolo More I think Zuma is just chicken - he's faking. @sechaba Montso Zuma is too scared to appear - he's faking illness. @Thapelo Motabogi Yes - JHB Council Chamber @Francoise Phillips Manyi lost his money. "@Francoise Phillips True ""The purchase price is to be funded by Oakbay via a loan it advances to Manyi‚Äôs company.""" @EDWARD LEGONG Not any more - he's faking illness. He's a coward. @Thabelo Emmanuel I agree with you - he must just go to his corruption case. Whatever he says here is a lie. @Pastor J ü§£ Yep - he's breaking all the records. That's also why he built a chicken run. @EDWARD LEGONG I agree - we SAfns are far too patient with these crooks. They continue to be in government and continue to steal the money. All these politicians are robbing us blind. They are the only ones not feeling the pinch. They live large. "@Elvis Malakoane If his lips are moving @Elvis Malakoane Yes - at least then we know we are not being BSed. "@EDWARD LEGONG Unfortunately @EDWARD LEGONG Or a tax revolt. Shut off their funds. "@Kapn Krunch While I agree with you RE the ANC looting @Thando Nkutha You mean to the ANC? You'd have to have rocks in your head to vote for them after hearing of all this corruption. @Thando Nkutha That's not an either-or. There are many other parties. @Thando Nkutha Yes - I do. I think they are fools for voting ANC. We've heard of how the ANC politicians behave from this commission. What on earth makes you think they care for us? @Thando Nkutha Like I've said - there are other parties. The ANC have proven they cannot govern with any integrity. The other parties should be given the opportunity to improve on that. @Thando Nkutha You're right - I'm not understanding your point. Are you saying the the ANC voters may vote for DA & FF+? @Thando Nkutha You do realise that at the last national elections there were something like 48 parties to vote for. "As long as the ANC is in power @Thando Nkutha You don't have that excuse anymore. @Thando Nkutha No - there are other parties. @Thando Nkutha And most of us were overjoyed then - now we cry when the ANC wins. @Thando Nkutha So what you are saying is that you are being ruled by fear - fear of the EFF. I never want to live my life being ruled by fear. "@Thando Nkutha I ask you with tears in my eyes - if the ANC @Thando Nkutha You're right - the ANC is definitely not going to turn it around. @Jane .Blamire I also agree - I think this commission needs to run permanently to continue exposing the corruption to public scrutiny. Angus who? @joe nkabinde And how do you think that's working out for us all? @Annalie Elizabeth Yes we do - it's a pity about the politicians though. "@Aj Otto But we shouldn't have to fight against our public ""representatives"" in order to do that." @Annalie Elizabeth He's faking - just a garden-variety coward. @Suzie Greer I am with you and Julian Assange. He's been treated despicably by so-called civilised nations. @Suzie Greer Julian Assange is a hero who highlighted the corruption of the world's governments. @Suzie Greer The silence of the media regarding Assange is telling. Who exactly are they beholden to? "@Diss & Dad We all know that was a BS story. Sweden has a lot to answer for. They @Suzie Greer Meds should only be prescribed by a doctor and any doctor that prescribes meds that are not required should be struck from the roll of doctors. @Diss & Dad Flattery will get you everywhere üòÅ I'll check it out. @Suzie Greer Wrong country - he's being extradited to the USA. @Pastor J No - there was never a charge - he was only requested to give a founding statement. No charges ever laid. @Pastor J ... there so that he could be sent to the US for spying charges. The rape charge was simply a ruse. @Pastor J He offered to give a deposition in the UK but Sweden refused because that would thwart their plans. @Pastor J Yes - and all because he exposed the truth of what our governments get up to. He's a hero in my book. @Pastor J He's now being kept in solitary confinement in UK and is not allowed to prepare his defence or meet lawyers. @Diss & Dad Yes - it was. It sounded like they were playing a computer game. @MIKE DURBAN I've always said that people will eventually beg to be micro-chipped. It'll be cool like Facebook. Everyone will want it.
Thulani Bukani,enca is live
Bernard Matolino,@Pastor J How are you my dearest brother? Long time Manyi deserves a Maleka @Yolo More Really? What was his gripe? üòÅüòÅüòÅhe wanted the chair to throw his chair around?
Deon de Swardt,So we saved a few million while commission did not sit ? Playing golf with Zabier Schaik ?
WANDILE NELSON CWEYA,"I""m still alive and kicking"
wendy hardy,Is this a new venue? Kapn Krunch I agree with you !
Person of interest,looks like they moved "Hai "Surprise zurprise nhlanlha saying venue is temp judge def has respiratory problems ingoung ongoing
nhlanhla nkosi,it's temporary venue
sechaba Montso,so i wish watch where is former president now? when is Mr Jacob Zuma going preson? Is Mr Zuma liable to chances of impresonment at anytime ever? would the commission supply me with documents evidance of the case at hand? D9cuments pls chair!!
Eliot Chauke,Different venue? Zuma wont return to the commission. watch the space
lehlogonolo Masuku,they saying he's sick * Jacob*
Nkululeko Mdluli,what's up with the new look?
clive oconnell,Zuma has enough wives looking after him that we pay each one plus babies They‚Äôve polished all their heads for makeover
Nande Vokwana,Nith'uZuma Wenzeni? "@Thando Nkutha ""EFF does not respect the lwas of the country..."" Which laws?? Is not the EFF that Pushed the same ANC to protect the Constitution and respect the laws of the country?" "@Thando NKhutha It starts with Malema?
Richard Nyila,The venue looks different? Is a new venue or make over? Zuma cant handle the state capture its becoming too hot to handle than anticipated. Last time he mentioned his voice going up and down due to flu no wonder what illness does he have now. Lies has short legs it does not travel far. I will advise him to take a shower so that the illness can go away or be healed so that he can attend the state capture commission.. On the 2nd thought Pastor you hit a nail in the head there true indeed. @Francois Phillips if i recall the ANN7 was sold to Manyi for half a Billion (R500 M) i just cant remember the term or the agreement that was entered into between Manyi and the Guptas on repayments? @Francois Jhaaa nhee interesting indeed i thought there entered into some sort of arrangement because Manyi did not have R500 M then i missed that one that he paid in full then he is the loser indeed. This country need the Arab springs uprising by citizens from all walks of life seemingly no ANC or DA or EFF or any other small political parties can fix the current quagmire its a bomb about to explo ESKOM alone owes debtors R450 Billion and it cant even repay interests on monthly basis from that amount because it running at a loss. Spend more money on operations than maintainance and upkeep...
Mikey Likesit,hey y'all
Thapelo Motabogi,"morning guys
WareWolf,Whats going on Zuma is too sick to appear?? LOOOOOOOOL Where is this place? Did the old venue become a security risk? Or why did they change? "Ricus Ellis "Weed party yay
Francoise Phillips,The doctor who booked Zuma off 'sick' needs to be investigated. Zuma is a con artist. Looking forward to hearing from Manyi how he managed to pay for ANN7 on his meagre government salary. @Richar Nyila I clearly remember Manyi stating to the press that he had 'fully paid up' the half a billion. Strange for an ex government spokesperson to have such funds. Derek Main I doubt he ever had any. This lady is thorough.
Ricus Ellis,"The venue is to be used by the owner of the venue for the rest of the week. Thereafter The term is DIRECTORS GENERAL and not director generals
Elvis Malakoane,I think commission sent Zuma today's affidavits rebutting his previous testimony and found out that he will further embarrass himself basically all he said last time was simply not true -i like this Adv's follow ups themba maseko I hear you badboy he will break that machine or confuse it Derek Main then we must pray he gets stroke
Edd Dance,Zuma will be coming on 11th November "I wasn't aware "I personally think "rural and urban citizens "Can those found guilt be prosecuted "Am hurt cos "Seriously "Prosecuting those found guilty now "Yah

Any Gov.......even if their is a new Gov in SA........ @Annalie Elizabeth ...it's All about Power and Money i'm afraid...... That's a fact...... Zumatjie has shamalitis......a very bad sickness.... Johnny Walker will sort him out and give him courage........heheh @Pastor J .....tooo true.....and don't forget the dhol......heheh We need an Iron Lady...........Helen ... @Diss......just maybe.......they knew what they were up againt.......just saying...

Kapn Krunch,if you dont deal with dangers to society it just emboldens other dangers to society our leaders need to have fear or they will never change their corrupt ways tax revolt will just hurt the less fortunate of our country we need to use the power vested in us and just vote properly the anc have been looting our country for 25 years and we keep putting them back in power what sort of message do you think that sends them we need to strip their wealth and put them in the slammer we need them to feel the fear so they can actually do something productive or face the consequences or nothing will ever change we must remove race from political parties thats one of our biggest problems its all about race all parties should represent south africans not demographics of south africans is all im saying how do we unify when government constantly segregate ANC are populist and just tell whoevers listening what they want to hear they are like cheap conmen decieving millions madiba didnt tell people what they want to hear he told people what they needed to hear its not just politics its bad politics "he told everyone that all were equal and all south africans nobody wanted to hear that he stood against vengeance i disagree
Singi Mathebula,i agree@ Robert Nyila Revive UDF JZ is too ill to appear before the commission. that was brilliant of you Maseko because you were going to join the unemployed.
