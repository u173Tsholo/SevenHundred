Kevin Simon,Remember this session could also expose how biased our PP was in her review. Also how NPA under previous head messed up the criminal case. Waiting! Constitutional Court came through for all South Africans today. Yes. PP lost. DCJ doesn't see in 3D! Otherwise he is brilliant. Phumelela Mantwana ‚ÄãTHE EFF WON'T RUN THIS COUNTRY IT WILL RUN THIS CONTINENT Your condition can be treated. Phumelela Mantwana I assume EFF are planning to invade other sovereign states? bafana mthombeni Really ?
Pheladi Lamola,Morning. Looking forward to some serious stuff today. Not that idiotic throat-clearing I don't remembers of last week. PP made such a mess of her investigation into Estina that I'm glad DCJ Zondo is looking into it as well. I love judge Zondo's hands. Thuli started the investigation but Busi completed it.
SOTECK,what's wrong with time keeping???? Even the courts can't keep time...oh gosh. At last

ANC and DA LOL @I Am Free you are now advocating for communism I thought you were anti communism THE EFF WON'T RUN THIS COUNTRY IT WILL RUN THIS CONTINENT THE EFF DOES NOT NEED YOUR LOUSY VOTES
Derek Main,@Phumelela Mantwana True - they are a bunch of criminals who care only about their own pockets. Corrupt to the core. Zuma ran like a coward. I definitely don't feel protected by the PP - she is too busy protecting the criminals. @watson mutanga That's a can of worms. Don't necessarily disagree but that's a minefield. @Ibo Thabo They can't think. @Ibo Thabo I'm not sure why. I agree Zuma was given preferential treatment and was treated with kid gloves. We already know he thinks he's above the law. @Simphiwe Mkhatshwa The commission doesn't need Zuma at all. They are just giving him an opportunity to give his side of the story. The judge will make a decision whether Zuma testifies or not. @Kabelo Katjedi That was just the lame excuse he used. @Kabelo Katjedi Zuma is nothing more than a coward. "@Simphiwe Mkhatshwa If he refuses to give evidence Up with your hands all the ANC voters. @Simphiwe Mkhatshwa We all know Zuma's strategy by now after watching it unfold over decades. He cannot be allowed to hold the commission to ransom and must suffer the consequences of not testifying. @Dominic Przybylski I agree with you - politicians are just parasites. More trouble than they're worth. @Thapelo Motabogi Don't worry we'll get to them all. Zuma first. "@Musa Bakiti Even if that's true (which I don't believe for a second) @Dominic Przybylski We are he cows our government are milking. @Born free Only if you were blind. @Eyamahlubi Radebe We all know who killed Hani.

Joe Khoza,"The next report to be set aside for PP is against pg "NoThando Can someone tell me how much is she suppose to pay "@Thando Nkutha. if you want comparison you have lost already. But please look at the present PP and her behavior
Dominic Przybylski,PP has extraordinary non-democratic powers. That's why the PP has to have exceptional integrity. This one certainly doesn't. "This Estina project is another PP case where she didn't investigate any of the political players i.e. Ace Magashule etc. Those who understand ethics and integrity hands up please. How many hundreds of millions were used to build these sheds? R2.5 million for two small brick walls and a gate! This is why we need a small government. The people of this country can look after themselves for far less than the the government pays itself to do it. Zondo is confusing issues now. "We need Thuli back as ""acting PP""." "Words instead of numbers would be better - eg ""Gate"" ""processing"" ""underground storage""" Google Earth would give a better image. This just shows that government should do nothing more than remove obstacles for private sector to create jobs. The wastage here and at SOEs is horrifying. We cannot have no government but we need a political party which will make it much smaller. Socialism is killing our economy/country and people will soon be starving. Reasl economic transformation needs cultural transformation where individual comes first. Then people with real initiative can be allowed to build a vibrant economy. Government/public sector are playing with other peoples money. If they blow it nothing happens to them. ANC were intodtrinated by Soviet Union who kept control via SACP who are in cabinet despite not having ever received a single vote. Zondo loves tea. Zuma is a confused man. He doesn't understand the difference between stealing and earning. He has so many supporters because so many in our country don't know either. I just had a look at new tractor prices. R150 000 for brand new tractor. R2.4 million will buy 160 tractors. Mistake. R2.4million buys 16 tractors. Was Zondo part of PP judgement. Government in business is guaranteed to be uncompetitive at best and corrupt at worst. "@daz tron You need to understand what ""invest"" means. It means ""buy"" and you can only buy that which is sold." "Heh! Look what happens when government does ""milk cows"". Where is the milk? Where are the cows?" @Salmaan Abrahams You can claim anything when your supporters have below average intelligence. They project did achieve the required goals. We just don't understand what the real goal was. R400 million for 100 beneficiaries! "What worries me is that so many millions of people in Somalia died of starvation when their state failed @Salmaan Abrahams I spoke to UN volunteers in early days of Somalian disaster. It was caused because people discovered they could steal from farmers if they had an AK47. Farmers couldn't continue. @Salmaan Abrahams Then you must know more than me. How did the West cause it? @bafana mthombeni How does the West create thieves in Africa?

Why none ever bluntly & frankly face him and tell him exactly the clearer points of what he did? Why not the ANC or the justice ever be frank with him? @Thando Nkutha Sometimes i feel that Zondo is slow "@DrydenCurtWell He is slow & disruptive sometimes to the leading witness "@Thando Nkutha Yes but he should be fast and able to go with the story particularly when a sharp leading witness ready to strike a blowing Q have anyone closer to Zondo or himself ever raise the needs to have all phone records & every kind of conversation record between Zuma & the Guptas in the last 10 years??? @Thando Nkutha Did you saw this now?

Yes Eric.. my thoughts are the same as yours. The government wants to turn it's land into rich men's playgrounds for profit. yes Daz Tron. True Sounds excessive expenditure Government funds are public funds. Stealing from the public purse. I am done with paying tax. The EFF will loot everything. Yes Daz.. and to sell the farm to a private individual for a profit to be divided among the thieves. The ANC are the architects of corruption The EFF will destroy this country in hours and not days. No the EFF have double standards. EFFs Shivumba "He will be prosecuted Zuma does not provide food Too.. Malema got Zuma in as President in 2009 Malema contradicts himself all the time. He is not worthy of ever being a President. Malema has the traits of Idi Amin. Malema has lost alot of weight he could have a slow puncture. EFF are getting assassinated one by one Just google. EFF have a price tag on their heads. Malema will not live long enough Malema has made some serious enemies they will take him out. Malema is an evil seed Correct.. Kabelo Trump is not the same as Malema Zuma didn't share the loot with Malema so Malema turned against Zuma Malema will fall on his own sword Malema takes money from whites and yet he hates whites Another failed project Over population leads to poverty During apartheid there was little poverty This is a lawless country Mankind originates from the cradle of Africa. Whites were the first blacks to explore another continent. Do you have any idea how long it took to turn white.. millions of years. Jacob.. Woza Wena Jacob.. hate speech will cost you alot of money.
