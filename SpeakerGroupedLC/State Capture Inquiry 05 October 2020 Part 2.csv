Mzalwane Mzala,Former DA Gauteng Chairperson has become the latest former DA leader to join Herman Mashaba's ActionSA John Moody joins ActionSA It disrupts the DA's foray into townships @Elvis Malakoane It will gain local government seats in Johannesburg and possibly Tshwane. So it will survive as one of the small parties. It will not be at the EFF scale. Which 2 guys @Eddie Reddy? @Elvis Malakoane The second biggest party is the DA and not the EFF. Is Mashaba prepared to work with the DA? Mashaba is making a mistake by not personally contesting the Mayorship of Johannesburg. He can still lead the party from Johannesburg. He is popular in Johannesburg
Elvis Malakoane,Mzalwane Mzala what is your honest view about Mashaba party Mzalwane Mzala But do you think it will make it as a party Mzalwane Mzala I think so too Mzalwane Mzala But I think I most municipalities eff will work with Mashaba Than work with ANC is it not towers because of the storms or something
Eddie Reddy,Music Maimane should join Herman it will be a real force Mzala if these 2 guys form a rainbow exec. they will draw a lot of votes I dont think Herman will work with EFF after the Thawne problem. Herman is very refined Mashaba is principled he won't work with da Leizel to garner evidence if Zuma influenced the ridding of the exec. to bring in the Gupta men "Dolan "Lorraine this guy is Linell
Sicelo Sebastien Magagula,. l
Lezil Lezil,I'm interested to know why zondo is so pedantic in his questioning around the timing of zumas entrance at the meeting of the 8th I know dudu says he wasn't there. he probably has a strategy for when zuma comes I cant wait will have to book leave yes now we know that she lied. tsosti placed zuma in the meeting and now linell oh yes she did she said why would the president interfere. she denied it what's that called? perjury? no doubt oh hes going down. just a matter of time dudu myeni lied and lied and lied some more @blake I'm sure they will. to tie things up she thinks shes smart this is mr linell dudu myeni legal adviser they must call jabu I have some questions for him
Teunis van Ree,Back at last
CHRIS GATSI,There is nothing wrong with him checking the timing its his job Dudu could have misled the commission This guy is also lying. He knew the targets before meeting MK veterans trying to distract citizens from the current issues
Gundo Mukwevho,sabc must not deprive us of engaging.
Lorraine Naidoo,Dudu next arrest Dudu can pick up the rand afterwards This men knows everything. lock him up please tell me who is this guy giving evidence Thank u Eddie thanks wow interference with weather Haibo 🤣🤣😃😃
Andre Gerber,Dudu start organizing your bail Nicholas Linnell
makhosi nobhatyi,"So Zuma and Myeni His day is coming we are close to find him @Khena "That why former commanders called meeting Is mr Linel still alive?
Antoinette Meyer,is this man in trouble bob hewit
Puseletso Khena,guy's what about BRA Ace ? which one Lorraine ? "Seriously we tired of this corruption 
ABRAHAM MALULEKE,Ke le batla One by one ~DCJ Ray Zondo 2020
Simmy Ndlovu,"going to jail at this age "@Lezi...she lied a lot
lufuno shumani muloiwa,state capture enquiry is a waste of money..evidence is there already we didn't need this commission. if i was a seating President i was going to issue notices of arrest myself with no Batoyi.
Diana Sekatane,zolile age does not matter when someone has to go to jail. look at Richard mdluli and his Co-accussed. correct Antoinette
Peter Lukas,This Dudu hands was really all over in the cookie jar "And she didnt had money to come to the commission
Maryann Diamond,wow ENCA is also off swak!!!!
