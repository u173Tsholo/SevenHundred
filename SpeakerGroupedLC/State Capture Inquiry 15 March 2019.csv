michael mbatha,Late as always. Sanibonani. "The start is never on time More comfort maybe Now compare this to the DG from yesterday. That stupid DG was fired by advisors of Mosebenzi Zwane. Even a minister cannot fire a DG but the president. Over-Zumalise @Sofia Sofia - Do update us also with death tolls in Cape flats too. @Magda Seguin - I do care more about deaths locally that in New Zealand. Regularity doesn't of it doesn't diminish importance @Isaac Patsa - I also thought their leave to cross-examine was denied. "If the Guptas or a Gupta brother was not at the meeting @Desmond Masilela - Jacob Zuma's son This lawyer is going there just to split hairs. This lawyer is lucky he's not dealing with Julius Malema. He will have rattled him. Waste of everyone's time Who does Trengrove represent?
Magda Seguin,Yes I saw that Mr Jonas will be cross examined by Zuma's sons counsel Today I decided to totally ignore trolls and bots Trolls hide behind anonymity "He blew the whistle about the Guptas What is your real name @Trucker? Trucker blocked Totally @Khaya state finance 101 @Peter do yourself a favour and block Trucker Brilliant oration...I agree Mr Trengrove looks downcast...faced with Mr Jonas intellect @Uncle I visited Morocco 3 times...they have solar power even in the smallest rural villages *Jngle...apologies Duduzane has a cheek!! We know his shenanigens Like father like son They never testified!! Fana must tell us about the arms deal Cross examination This man has no reason to lie...He refused R600m and was fired! @Dylan puppet masters @Sofia It was 40 this morning...tragic "@michael...death is present on a daily basis on the Cape Flats @michael true The Guptas and Zuma must come show their faces...they hide behind lawyers It is nice to write stories from far away @Isaac it is the Commission rules and legalities "It is disgusting that the Guptas can write and deny...what does that say about SA law?..Extradite them WMC is a phrase that was coined by a firm in the UK at the behest of Zuma that is now defuct *defunct Stop using the phrase WMC...it is a populist slogan to obfuscate and brainwash the weak @Noko nuclear with the Russians amounted to trillions...it would have emptied the Treasury I wish every SA can read the Gupta emails...the thieves left a damning trail of evidence @ Mike so you are suggesting that Jonas was fired for lying about the R600m.Let me guess...now who would willingly give up a highly paid job just to be famous?Pun intended. Jonas legal counsel starting @Cerebis I report anyone who goes against community guidelines on social media ...I had excellent results and confirmations of people prohibited thereafter Some erroneously think the EFF was the 'genesis of the Commission but in fact it was the PP report that called for a commissiom @Derek spot on @Lyl Mr Jonas legal counsel touches on things that Duduzanes counsel may bring up It is not discrediting...it is to highlight the lawyers discrepencies So many trolls and bots that know who is lying and who not The troll/bot masters told their minions to shout...ie use capital letters Thank you @Zola Only in South Africa...The King of Belgium walks alone in public So politicians are not supposed to have a private life?? All about Jonas lawyer statement...sabotage much?? He never signed the statement Yesterday we experienced how bad it is to sign blindly Are politicians scared of the people? Some even have 8 bodyguards @Thulani ...lol There is a saying: 'when you speak the truth you don't have to remember lies' In context he is saying that he didnt trust the NPA and Hawks to report the death threats heaven sent? dream on LOL!! South Africans are deeply traumatised but also numb with all this Zuma/Gupta 9 wasted years I reported Luxolo Nogobela for harassment and hate speech It looks the lawyer who wrote the unsigned statement worked with the NPA I was thinking the same Writing to the Speaker to implicate Jonas...eish the ZumaGuptas will stop at nothing Political appointees at the NPA and Hawks warning against Cope and DA? Some people don't listen and internalize...The statement was NOT signed by Jonas His lawyer at tbe time who tried to discredit him Jonas referred to his affadavit before the commission ALL the time to debunk the false statement @Benny it appears that we are not talking about the same commission..which one are you listening to "Jonas had ONE affidavit Does anyone believe the Guptas?? what a joke Cyber documents can be accessed forever...Duduzanes is playing with fire Thanks Judge...we need forensic evidence @Lyl...it is threats in another language
Edwin Arthur,"yes late
Anne M.,Should be interesting Nice of the Judge to apologise
Joel Mzayidume,Molweni maXhosa Thank you Jonas. HE's on point. This is where late Professor Sampie Terreblanche comes in Thank you Jonas. Zuma found state capture he didn't create it. This chap is smart Man I'm impressed I wish Professor Terreblanche were still alive. He would have educated DCJ Zondo on the political economy of state capture the nuclear deal Mr Jonas is a straight talker and is not panicking. different to Vytjie Mento @Dylan Burden Duduzane knows who butters his bread. simple @Lyl Bali you're spot-on @Trucker you think Jonas is lying? Wow @Trucker that is strong Guys please leave @Trucker alone. I find him intriguing @Thando Nkutha me too. HEre comes the fun please be quiet Kwenzenjani manje @Sipho Mkize? eish Jonas is in trouble. i can smell it. Sorry @Norman Zwane i have no idea This lawyer is going to wipe the floor with Jonas @Sipho Mkize akuzifebe leKwaMashu yinkindlane. who said these words? Where is @yose human when we need him. @Sipho Mkize would have met his match so @Sipho Mkize what do you think of Cyril Ramaphosa? @Vanessa Govender he's met his match This lawyer is all over the place. He's not enlightening Zondo on anything This lawyer has nothing to say. he must just sit down. @Benny Bala he's so relaxed This lawyer has nothing on Jonas. Where is Mr Mkize Mr Mkize where are you? @Indoda Yamaqiniso Jonas' credibility has not even been scratched. What's your point The lawyer seems desperate @Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi i beg to differ sir Mcebisi Jonas wins 5-0 Jeez the lawyer is giving up? "10 minutes is up Jonas excelled under cross-examination
Norman Zwane,"@Joel Mzayidume I'm Zulu @Ntombethemba Manase Are you perving sisi? "There is quite a fine web of lies in the statements of these three viz. Zuma @Trucker I think you are playing a Rocky III soundtrack to a Skeem Saam episode. It maybe you are hearing something we are not seeing. @Trucker Yah we heard you. Do you need to repeat it. Ah NKOSINI "@Thando Nkutha As to what you have missed@Trucker "@Trucker Whilst your medication is still holding up "@welton paulse Very nifty moves by the Guptas @Derek Main As to shabir's health..the rest as they say is history. @Derek Main I was so pathetic at the game I took to hiding my gifted golf clubs to avoid BP @Mpho Mashigo You know the board game Monopoly mos Mpho? @Mpho Mashigo These are baby steps... You know it has 'money' mos? @Mpho Mashigo Finally we are there. It seems the watsons regarded what we call money no more than the 'game money' "@Lyl Bali first time I saw a Chinese football team "@Lyl Bali I think the sqme with the Guptas "@MIKE LOCK Cheap skate you @MIKE LOCK Ouch. I thought the 'Lock' in your 2nd name was to avoid such slips? The cross examiner #1 is chomping at the bit ready to rip through Mcebisi. Tjo tjo tjo... "I see flames "@Joel Mzayidume My laptop chat line keeps saying ""say somethin"". How do I turn that off?"
S Nompozolo,Camagu @Joel Mzayidume
Mpho Kgomotso,side observation...why is mcebisi Jonas always wears his tie loosely? it is just after 09h00 but he looks like he just had a long day
Ntombethemba Manase,Swagg You wish We trust him Only RET and BLF forces that do not trust him. We BELIEVE Mcebisi Jonas. "And he is not only angelic "Norman I am impressed too. u Trucker is just blowing air. You wont change our mind on Mcebisi Jonas. You are just wasting your time and energy. "He is one of the credible witnesses "Dylan
Trucker Trucker,THAT LYING MCEBISI WILL BE EXPOSED TODAY!! @Magda Seguin YOU MEAN THE LIES THAT HE TOLD ANBD COULD NOT PROVE? HE COULD NOT EVEN TELL WHO TRIED TO BRIBE HIM. A PATHOLOGICAL LAIR. @Magda Seguin RELEVANCE? Mcebisi Jonas where is the Nelson Mandela funeral money? @Peter Staffen LOL YOU NEED TO READ! @Peter Staffen AND YET YOU DON'T KNOW THAT MCEBISI IS IMPLICATED IN THE MISAPPROPRIATION OF OVER 60 MILL FOR MANDELA'S FUNERAL. Mcebisi left under a cloud of corruption as CEO of Eastern Cape Development Corporation. This is the same man who was fired from COEGA for corruption and emerged as MEC at EC where he allegedly stole from the Mandela funeral monies. @Solomon Ndubane cool story bro. @Orbert Mulaudzi be quiet Orbet. "@Ntombethemba Manase If i am wasting my own time Mcebisi Jonas never met Ajay Gupta. Mcebisi Jonas only has his say-so and no other evidence. Ajay Gupta has cell-phone records as evidence. We are watching this circus. @Lyl Bali intelligent? LOL you just made my morning. I can't wait for Duduzane to cross-examine this lying clown. EXPOSE HIM!!! LOL UNABLE TO COMMENT ON THAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN JONAS???!!! "LOL RAISE YOUR VOICE 😂🤣😂🤣😂 Mcebisi Jonas’ foot tapping says a lot about his panic😂🤣😂 MCEBISI JUST ADMITTED THAT HE LIED ABOUT DUDZANE TAKING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!😂🤣😂 @Dylan Burden BODY LANGUAGE EXPOSES A LOT WHEN A PERSON IS LYING!!

BLOCK ME FOR WHAT NOW? 😂😂 Lol Mcebisi Jonas was so afraid of the Guptas death threats that he didn't tell Thuli Madonsela! What a joker😂😂 @Thulani Bukani Shame man when people can't debate they start creating conspiracy theories about war rooms. @Thando Nkutha BLOCK ME AGAIN!! "@Thando Nkutha block me again "DON'T GET EMOTIONAL GUYS @Thando Nkutha I WANT YOU TO BLOCK ME!1 "THANK YOU JUDGE ZONDO @welton paulse LOL BRO? HOW DO YOU NOT REMEMBER WHO OFFERED YOU A WHOLE 600 MILLION AND THREATENED TO KILL YOU? MCEBISI IS A CLOWN😂😂😂 @Thulani Bukani RAMAPHOSA IS THE ONE WHO GOT R500 000 FROM BOSASA "JONAS goes to the PP to pen a report on STATE CAPTURE & talk EXTENSIVELY about it The fact that Mr Mcebisi Jonas doesn't know which Gupta bribed him is cause for concern.The case will be easily thrown out in a court of law. @Mpho Mashigo LOL MSHOLOZI KNEW THAT PEOPLE WOULD EXPOSE THEMSELVES!! "DUDUZANE UP NEXT @Mpho Mashigo I don't know how these people can't see that Jonas is a clown. @Sipho Mkize YOU NEED TO RELAX BOET!! THIS IS GOING TO BE LIT1 JONAS IS GOING TO GET BURNED!1 "@Mpho Mashigo Yeah that's what I figured "Sipho Mkize is a white man MCEBISI LOOKS NERVOUS. STUTTERING AND TAPPING😂😂😂 RAISE YOUR VOICE MR JONAS LOL. SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST! @she she I AGREE! @Thando Nkutha WHY ARE YOU CARRYING ON LIKE YOUR BLOCK CHANGES THE WORLD? @Thando Nkutha HAMBA!! @Derek Main so when can black people ever claim that their race is superior when we're the ones who have had to endure colonialism and slavery because of your people's superiority complex? @Derek Main WHITES ARE OPPRESSED? LOL WHAT? I WON'T ENTERTAIN THIS MADNESS. "So Thuli Madonsela's state capture report was based on factually incorrect statements. First Vytjie @Cassius Mngomezulu IT WAS WRITTEN IN MCEBISI'S NAME AND HE SAW IT!! LOL JONAS IS NOW BRINGING UP INTELLIGENCE REPORTS COMPILED BY APARTHEID SPIES! @Serepa Le Mabona SO YOU KNOW BETTER THAN JUDGE ZONDO? Why has Mcebisi Jonas been quiet about the fact that the statement sent by his lawyers to the commission was incorrect?
Sibongakonke Zaca,This guy Mcebisi is clear a liar who thinks he can be trusted by us as ordinary citizen truth shall make you feel free but Jonas.Mentor they lack credibility in their testimony since this state capture tht was set by Thuli Mandonsela whom i think also fail to be honest in this matter
Joe Ndlovu,judgment day judgment day for him if he is corrupt or not he blow whistle because the Gupta's have rejected him he go the several time remember
welton paulse,"morning everyone @Yin Yang thank you "Hey this guy is smart man "So Jonas and others like him got fired for DOING their jobs and those who ddnt do their jobs got rewarded and promoted @Musa Bakiti jirrrr @Tulonga Henoch these departments seems to be run by ghosts The Guptas are a bunch of con artists Can we just agree that there was a ZUPTA present? Other brothers wer hiding under bed or on wardrobe "@Magda Seguin "@Lyl Bali  Ja ja ja u thought Jonas was a fool. Tel him Jonas "Go Jonas What is this guy on about?
Solomon Ndubane,"Sorry chief "Mcebisi is a very smart politician "Mr/Ms trucker "I still to meet a squeaky clean politician
Lufefe Mkutu,As South Africans we stand with you Mr Mcebisi Jonas.keep strong Tucker you are narrow and shallow. @rooiperd this country would go far !
Lungisani Ntshonga,Am I wrong is this guy Mr R600000 jonas
Khaya Nomoyi,He is actually giving them a Master class. Magda you are absolutely correct.Untortunately we have a lot of people who fail to think properly and cannot differentiate between logic and stupidity. This lawyer is fumbling he does not have a strategy and now is trying to implicate Jonas in other unrelated cases.This lawyer is actually going to destroy Duduzane's version. The lawyer is stressed bcos he does not get the answers he want.The most important thing for his case is what happened at the Gupta house and is not giving Duduzane's version. This lawyer must put his client's version.He should not have taken this case as it makes him look like a fool. What a stupid version that would require a meeting about rumours. Lyl I agree with you bcos in most instances it is Duduzane who arranges for these meetings.The same happened with Mr Ramatlodi.
PETER STAFFEN,Trucker what has he got to do with mandela funeral money "Trucker read what  "Trucker you have now actually proven you are brain dead  Michael Michael i block idiots like this Michael Michael yes
Groucho Beserko,Jonas is smart
Sfiso Nkosi,At least Today we having someone who can think and was aware of his surrounding unlike the Dr yesterday "when we speak integrity As for the Nuclear deal. the issue was the manner in which It was gonna be done. but in reality we do need that nuclear plant to solve our power crisis

Eric Kandekana,actual zuma is in everywhere why zuma is denying everything abt corruption
Godfrey Thaele,where is mandelas funeral money?
Nelson Musoliwa,He smartly articulated our societal fabric which needs visionary framework to develop with the main aim of redressing the past; well done Jonas Did the confrontation Holongwane talk about occurred in gupta house. Two ministers Ramatlodi and Jonas called by Duduzane to meet him who and on which capacity did he do that? Son of president got no authority to do that Bali and at no point did he discuss business with this ministers but they made unstatemanship move by agreeing to meet him. Hlongwane absconded from coming to cross exmine Jonas shame
Kgalalelo Prosperity,which cebo are u referring to?
Akani Kupani,they are his kidz
Keitumetse Kekana,Daddy! 😂😂

"@Jhay White people think they own everything in South Africa.They only don""t own EFF and Juju" @Dylan Burden i am not racist and i cannot be because am black.I just don't like afrikaaners.

Kodwa what is this lawyers' version from his client? Tip toe Lawyer proofs nothing so far Police also cooked up data by themselves to support the higer office How can a police make statement on your behalf if I am not brief about it? "Zuma lawyer did not touch about the issue of what was discussed to say Jonas is lying Zuma can lie sowaar "Atleast Mr Jonas came
Cerebis,"This guy was considered as the new CR17 Finance Minister before Mboweni Shabby Shaik also greatly improved his Golf Handicap!! I blocked and reported Sipho for Hate speech. Thank you Desmong....agree!! "Thanks Magda. Amazing that with our Country's challenges "This Advocate is totally within his rights to ask questions "There are parts of the evidence of Mr Jonas that do come across a bit flaky There is is! Adv Trengrove has now corrected the false perceptions?
Niematullah Rakeep,Cerebis interesting deduct tio deduction I meant Whats happening? Jonas speaks with fork tongue that's what's happening lol. Chiang main Springbok you are CORRECT If Pravin cannot be trusted why should Jonas be trusted? They are birds of the same feather. There are something seriously wrong with some of the people commenting here. If you cannot by now distinguish truth from falsehood you NEVER WILL. Jonas for Pollmoor. 🙃 The lawyer thusfar has already done his job by pointing out all contradictions and lies. yes exavt Any person thinking that Jonas is truthful must have his or her head read. Why doesn't Gordhan want to be cross examined? And Fakey Vytjie another lair If all these Statements are untrue whyvarevwe wasting data? why pay this commission? Fakey Mental is Narcassistic

Duduzane Zuma once said that to be where he are it was because of Guptas. Therefore he will try by all means to protect them. @Yin Yang. Really!!!??? @Yin Yang. This is what was going to happen here in SA. Where head office would be moved from Pretoria either to China or India. @Musa Bakiti. 😂😂😂😂 Really!! I thought this was going to happen @Yin Yang. It would be bad at all. "But why are we going back to Gupta. Whether Gupta was there or not "@Thando Nkutha @Thando Nkutha. He just want your attention. @Musa Bakiti. Schabir Shaik was arrested eventually he was release on a parole due to his illness. @Thando Nkutha. 😂 Me too. but his not that bad.

This lawyer must just move on Mcebisi Jonas stood his ground and frustrated this lawyer in the process.🤣🤣 Yes Adv Trengrove. Your learned friend didn't even touch on what the meeting was about. Very telling.
Thokozani Khayelihle,it's way too early on this commission
Bongani Tshabalala,"you can simply tell that he has nothing to hide
StarManRSA,Why is Duduzane trying so hard to protect the Guptas? Glad it's plain as day to everyone. Hi @Moira T ! "I imagine they will have to go through each person's evidence and establish who is the most "@Trucker Are you a professional at human behavior? I also tap my foot all the time @Jhay we don't need your racism here. "@Trucker so are you a professional in human behavior? Or perhaps psychology? Also @Musa Bakiti why you so racist? @Trucker we can see that. I am saying it is not necessary. @Trucker Your bias towards Duduzane is very suspicious. I recommend you all block Trucker @Musa Bakiti anybody can be racist. being black does not make you immune. You cannot paint an entire race with one brush. In South Africa we are all individuals. Peace and love. "Guys @Isaac Patsa it is from Duduzane. "@Lyl Bali if we silence him "Guys How dare he travel alone at lunch time with the President's son. Is the lawyer of Jonas not allowed to interdict this lawyer?

How stupid wena. Nene must be a big bitcoin player. 32 peaces of silver from Bosasa safes. How low can you go with zuma and mafia. Julius will eat this lawyer like chewing gum Why are Zumas using white lawyers? No its about the affirmative actiosn. Bosasa money comes to Zuma lawyer. Eishhh now you see Zuma lawyer eating sadsa No advocate Fana Hlonganwe Jonas is looking more true now. No adv Fana No Jonas is clear. Fana is the banker. "Jonas be careful Oh no wher eis yr friends statement Jonas is true. They try to mess him. Viva the old style ANC. Not the Zuma ANC. Eastern Cape struggle. Messy. Why they dig up Mandela name? "Take it slowly Jonas Chiang Mai Springbok did you meet the famous Marc? "Now lawyer says MR Hlonagwane Willie you read it right. "Jonas is true. Lawyer getting hungry and angry because Jonas is protected by truth Jonas is true. Zuma lawyer getting very angry. Did the vehicle have 4 wheels ? How do you know? He even left his VISA card behind. OK very very what exactly? This lawyer is getting more stupid each minute. So Desperate. Why did Jonas not be careful with the wording of statement? Seems it was trapped by purpose. Becasue Jonas did not want the big problems he knew it would be very difficult. Very smart not trusting so many state organisations. This Jonas is true. This Jonas is true the lawyer is desperate for emali Now lawyer is being racist. Why should he know? Jonas is much smarter than this Zuma lawyer.

So please. We see through all your rubbish. Eish This lawyer is nowhere This lawyer is crazy. If you are deputy minister and the president says let’s go to a meeting fast. How can you say no? Jonas has better English than the lawyer. Jonas was taught how to deal with interrogation This lawyer is going back to the initial question now because he sees he’s losing. Reminds me of my gf.
Isaac Patsa,Are we going to see these people appearing at the commission So why is Mr Jonas answering questions from the Guptas who have refused to appear
Serepa Le Mabona,The plot to use this platform to tarnish ANC and not individuals involved with the hope of gaining votes will be defeated. Kabelo! Do you see VBS and Mazzotti as indicators of cleanliness? Sipho Mkhize! What about EFF? You are getting less than 6% this time. You have shown people your true colours while ANC has shown that it can clean its own mess. Myka! Criminals are not allowed in parliament irrespective of what branches want. They will fall one by one and the clean ones will remain. It is very questionable that it is branches but matters not. "Luxolo! Anyone who is anti-State Capture to you is a liar "Mkize! It looks like your income depends kn how many times you mention EFF "This cross questioning is flawed "When is Duduzane giving his side "WMC is bad for Zumas

"@she she Sure - prejudice @Trucker Because blacks now have political power and whites are suffering some oppression in the guise of transformation. @she she Take a look at some of the racist comments here - clearly they feel superior and generalise about all whites - that's racist no matter how you try to dress it up. @Trucker Yep - the currently disadvantaged

Kapn Krunch,the Chinese beat us in soccer that's what's intoxicating we are not oppressed in our minds that's why despite the law we still prosper you cant deny facts
Myka'Al Daud,ANC branches want all those rot in the movement n Cyril can't do anything about it.So his choice is to use state money to clean his party.What a shame Branches have decided that they want corruption to continue "Sipho is an agent spreading hate speech "Sipho is not one of us "Cyril must clean his party "We nid to fund education "Cyril is a toothless man We can't waste another 25 years with toothless leaders Send your corrupt leaders to integrity committee n expel them but u won't bcos u drank with power Zondo is out of touch with what's happening now in our country Discipline some1 s child u ll b dealt with b rest assured "Jane i don't expect u to understand what i m saying Kapn ll never comprehend what Afrikans went thru. Is BLF a faction of ANC that want RET? When is your manifesto launch or was it launched by ANC at Nasrec "Don't fall for false hope of new dawn  Branches of ANC still led by the same ppl But your lawyers statement u must read b4 it is send away "the lawyer send it b4 he read it "Where did the lawyer get this statement from So this statement that was send to Thuli by the lawyer was just rubbish how come u don't check your statement 🙄🙄🙄 "The lawyer must be charged "some 1 saw the holes on the 1st statement  Did he trust his NEC comrades in the ANC "Malema told Zuma face to face about this Guptas in Rusty "I m shocked he didn't trust even the police minister What we must find is why there was a meeting at saxonwold.details of the meeting
she she,Desmond don't bully us racism is racism if we see it we going to say exactly that blacks can never be racist @Thando check out what racism means first "@thando becareful about what @dereck can u define racism yes and how do blacks feature there ? @dereck mbalula na @thando what makes u say no case the lawyer is establishing inconsistencies in probing narratives and facts "@thando Jonas was having contacts with journalists @lucky he was lying with the pp and said something else with the commission in his original testimony he said he was contacted by Duduzane but now he says he is the one who contacted Duduzane @Thando HOW ? @Thando the positions produced it as his statement and he saw and agreed but ddint sign cos he knew those were lies hence he is not a credible witness because he had an agenda @rakeep the whole bunch do not understand..or they are journalists trying to further a common narrative "@imdoda exactly "@indoda absolutely "@thando

I believe him lets tip toe on? Jonas at great cost to his career told the truth . Nit picking over minor details does not take away this mans truth. Hang in there Jonas Nah was picking his teeth lol
Caron Hill,EFF off Sipho Mkize
majara paschal lebenya,EFF my home
Zamuxolo Mbangcolo,Who is this lawyer representing?
Mhlobo Gunguluzi,Blocking dissenting voices is undemocratic and even more. That is the view of fascists. Unlearning racism needs people to be anti-racism of course. All Commissions in South Africa were just a white wash and there is no difference with Zondo Commission which is eating time so that we can reach the elections without noticing the rot of the ANC. Why are people not prosecuted instead of wasting our money in useless end Why was Agrizzi arrested after the Commission but others implicated not arrested. This Commission stinks. Now is the time to grill Jonas before even grilling Duduzane. Mxm kudlalwana ngathi apha. Who believe the Guptas today except for BLF and Zuma faction within the ANC??? Not only the NPA and Hawks that are captured but this Public Protector too
Kamogelo Maphunye,been waiting for this kind of lawyer...pity h's on an irrelevant witness
Akani Muhlava,This lawyer
Ntsieni Avhashoni,Rudeness does'nt help any lawyer to win the case Guptarian lawyer Real Lawyers still exist... the Tengteng
Vanessa Govender,This lawyer is breathing so loud he is trying hard to sound vicious...bro mcebisi is not a small boy
Chiang Mai Springbok,This lawyer is a supercilious punk whose been given his day to grandstand. This bozo of a lawyer is better suited to be a character in a Mickey Spillane mystery story.
Luxolo Nogobela,Jonas is a LIAR JONAS IS A LIAR @Benny Bala no prime can walk around withoyt bodyguards this lawyer is heavenly sent😎😎 Jonas is being EXPOSED FOR HIS LIES "YOU CAN'T LIE FOREVER "THULI MADONSELA MUST ALSO COME TO THE STATE CAPTURE
Lesedi,This lawyer is just trying to discredit the witness with petty errors. He's being a typical lawyer doing his job. No firm evidence to question the witness's claims
lucky Molepo,this Jonas Jonas though Jonas was feeding us with gossip statement for Jonas is worrying though So Mcebisi Jonas is admitting to sending Thuli Madonsela3 incorrect statements which formed part of her state capture report 🤔🤔. Jonas fed us with lies thats Pravin doesnt want to be cross examined @Lyl Bali the feeding us with gossip Jonas will be grilled for free he fed us gossip This commision must close cause Jonas is denying the stament to public protector @Niematullah Rakeep spot on @Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi he thought cross examination is like some gossip on the street Thuli Madonsela must be called
Benny Bala,"Jonas has nothing to hide Viva EFF! This lawyer is trying to punch holes but Jonas is dissapointing him @Dumile Mateza Irrelevant? HOW Sir? @Kenny Mataboge Thank you Kenny @Dumile Mateza Apology accepted. This lawyer is clumsy. No basis at all. Trying to put Jonas on the HOOK but he has no ammunition. @Lyl Bali There was negligence on Jonas's attorney. "@Dumile Mateza Really @Luxolo Nogobela Yes there is such a practice in peaceful countries. Jonas is so Kool. Nothing to worry about. His body language says 'You are boring'. This lawyer chowed ZUPTA money. Trying to shine. LAWYER HAS NO CASE. HEAD OF ARGUMENT- I have difficulty in finding or labeling Jonas a LIAR. @Lyl Bali This lawyer is just chowing the ZUPTA money Jonas is bored Not hJonas's number- What do you think of the lawyer's research? Credibilty is questionable here. This lawyer is indifferrent about this case. "@Thando Nkutha Exactly Waste of time. @Niematullah Rakeep The lawyer's affidavit is incorrect. @Buhle Ntombela You don't accuse people with incorrect facts. Made up facts. "IN LAW- It's what you can prove @Khaya Ngcatshe YES "@Buhle Ntombela Be as it may "If ZUPTAS bribed Jonas @Magda Seguin And the AFFIDAVIT has got hole it. "He went there unknowingly but accepted no BRIBES @ Magda Seguin Personal phone/cell numbers are incorrect. That's what I reffered to.
Dumile Mateza,@Benny Bala dont be irrelevant @Benny Bala my apologies i did not undersatnd the context Is this the highest viewership on U Tube 2 879 This misconception that politicians and ministers need protection is rather strange. This is another issue that should be attended to in cutting down costs by the government.sometimes these people are our friends but as soon as they become ministers all of a sudden need potection As as the HAWKS and the NPA are arresting people this brazeness by the enablers is going to come to an end. They must stop looking at low hanging fruit I meant to say as soon as they start areesting people "Who is this lawyer representing Duduzane @Indoda yamaqiniso do those who are accused and put this country's economy in danger csn they remember the mess they caused. @Indoda yamaqiniso I am so happy that you are a lone voice in the wilderness defending the indefensible "I would rather be a clever balck than even though black do not own the economy H e has not put a single issue said either by Duduzane or Hlongwane. Who is he representing exactly @Buhle Ntombela you argument is flawed both in law and fact when you still you are charged in relation to who was in the room with you or who saw you. Here is an advocate Wim Trengove That is what an advocate does when he cross examines
Zola Pinda,Mcebisi is very composed. His articulation is crisp. He has saved our country from the Guptas You've done well Mcebisi.

Mxolisi Williams,Mr Jonas is firm on hs answers I like how he handles this Gupta paid lawyer.
mandisi ntauzana,"this Advocate is making inroads
Thelsa,Poor Mr Jonas is painting himself in a corner.. He's going to hang himself
Yvonne Morudu,sipho mkhize what is the meaning of one settle one bullet sipho what is the meaning of settle one bullet
Tekani Mabasa,I just want to hear the version of his client except small contradictions which does not exclude meeting of Duduzani and Jonas "the attorney/legal rep is helping the commission to dig more
Sanelise Veli,Jonas is guilty
Willie Makena,Hey banna wmc is representing the man who is against wmc "@Luxolo ""heavenly sent"" by who for what" "This lawyer is trying to intimidate Jonas with his gestures

Mfaniseni Sibisi,This lawyer though 😂😂😂
Cornel Visser,Only trying to discredit Jonas. Nothing about his serious alegations. Only frivolous issues.
Herbert Zulu,Jonas is Pravin's lapdog All of it...new and old Jonas may be clean in the context of this commission but he is Pravin's lapdog I agree Simphiwe
Herbert Hlahla,lawyer i meant.. Duduzane's legal team shouldn't have opted to cross-examine coz their argument has no basis
Mongezi Mati,Jonas is resilient
Keogotsitse Mosai,"this lawyer always says ""let move on quickly""still repeat" i agree he looks nerves to me old white school not Wits Haaaaaaaaaa PLS call me
Crispian Gallon,Tone of lawyer very condescending @francel true Fana Hlongwana's lawyers mis omw
Phillimon Lepale Masehla,the lawyer is a bad fellow he is not sure about a lot of things our jonas knows his story and he does not beat about the Bush I agree with you Pravin is untrustworthy Jonas is Frank and straight forward if hear the name ntlemeza eish he was stupid police boss
Francel van Eeden,@ crispian so true.jonas came forward with a corruption how can it be allowed for lawyers to speculate on lies and make it the truth. this lawyer has no shame he will sell his soal for a quick buck Jonas you go sir. humiliate this lawyer further please a fabricated statement becomes this lawyers proof?
Indoda Yamaqiniso,Not sure😂😅 "Mcebisi Jonas and Vitjie Mentor This commission was implemented based on lies. Did they put this country at danger or they tempered with white monopolies?😂😅 "Mcebisi Jonas
Neil Fraser,This lawyer has failed to discredit Mr Jonas This is a looooong half hour
Buhle Ntombela,Even a small child can see who is a liar here everything it was not my statement but that statement is the one who led to this commission kushukuthi Jonas ubona izinto zokudlala nje la bazomembula I like when the lawyer said let's leave that he was driven by the people who threatened to kill him to the airport If you denied anything written by your lawyer who's stupid here? the answer is obvious if you pass grade 1 What's happened in when you live Eastern Cape and who brought you back to government I like it About the bribe Jonas said it himself his not sure who was in the house and he decided to leave his body guards to go to the place he don't know I'm a judge but I can see who is Jonas But all his answer is proving Jonas otherwise frankly I use to think Jonas is a smart man but let's wait and see because the investigation will follow maybe his right who knows It's not his statement but the statement is the one which was used by public protector which Public Protector lied to the Nation We are here because of Jonas statement but now he denied everything kanti lomhlaba unjani noPastor uphikile ukuthi uthe uvuse umuntu kwabafile Here is no about believing Zuma or not but its about to get the truth thats why you have to wait until child's birth before you give the name for now we are just commenting about what we see not media
Nditsheni JOP,Viva Jonas you are relaxed this is truth to power Duduzane Zuma must take a stand as well Truth and lies is like water and oil. Bewarned Duduzani Ntlbemeza Yokoh Nhlmeza is synonymous with lies How do we expect Jonas to trust Nhlemeza. This lawyer has ran out of idea and questions Trengrove just walked over Nhlemeza

Thembani Billy Ntuli,Lawyer failed dismally........shame
Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi,"Jonas is an unreliable witness "you'll have to be beyond gullible or blind not to see that Jonas was lying through his teeth lies have short legs indeed "Jonas doesn't have the luxury to chose which statements that should be accepted "He is a pathetic witness "Magda "In his statement to the Public Protector "But I'm not shocked at all by this "There was no meeting with the Gupta family "Jonas himself agreed with the Gupta family that there was no meeting with the family "according to Jonas
Kids Collie,Did he sign the statement? IF not then it isn't his statement is it?
Vumani Khambula,Jonas is a pathological liar
