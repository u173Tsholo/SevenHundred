House keeping??? @King Vuka 😂😂😂 my Mom loves Kwesta. @King Vuka Will do😃😃 @Jake Ellis They're very ambitious @Linda He said no. "@Jake Ellis I think it's taking them long for it to click that things have changed "@Desmond Masilela SA didn't have an Extradition Treaty with the UAE until late last year "@Jake Ellis And what happens now It was signed late last year. Zondo is short. @Lee 😃😃😃 "@rohan barnard True @Jake Ellis Money. Their deep pockets gets them protection. Mr A channel People usually pick who they can afford or those they think can better represent them. "@Linda ERASMUS They are @Eslon Eslon No one knew. It was Ghost Money. No traces of it anywhere. So they did as they pleased. "@Desmond Masilela He went underground long ago. No one knows where he is These people really hurt Agrizzi's feelings. 😂😂😂 sober. @Mzalwane Mzala Thought I was the only one who caught that. Recordings @jeevan singh Knowing our Hawks and NPA I wouldn't be surprised if the man is at his house or job. No one bothered to go look for him. They release criminals to go sort out people. @Prince Ziwa Stop😃😃😃😂 @Charlie Komape My sentiments exactly. 👀 Zondo 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀ "He knew because he's recorded people so many times Agrizzi knew how it went down etc. They just caught him on the wrong day and sadly he thought he could handle like he always does but he wasn't of sober mind. The R-word🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀ So Pistorious wants to pick the damning clip?? "@Vicky Kgoete He is This recording has been out since forever. And it's not like Agrizzi didn't know it would come up. What's the relevance of this clip? He's a racist. I don't care. Doesn't change anything. Dudu Myeni cannot justify her actions by hiding behind this man's racism. @Eslon Eslon I copped that too. Now they're going to push the racism issue and forget the corruption. Pistorious is forever going on about Relevance etc. What's the point of this? @Moria T Thank you. Racism is wrong. But we're not there. CORRUPTION!!! "@Asanda Yes @Ndumiso Mavuso Exactly. We've known about his racism. "@what? That's how they always get us @Eslon Eslon True. And he always cuts him off everytime he wants to give context to things. @Sendo Sityebi Pinky Khoabane @pinkykhoabane @Sendo Sityebi Check her tweets from yesterday. She was also pushing the racism thing. @rohan barnard She did. @michael mbatha She was freaking out. @Eslon Eslon Pistorious does my head in🤬🤬 "Agrizzi thought they would just blackmail him

michael mbatha,They wanted to start early but even for later start time they start late. And resume late from tea and lunch. Agrizzi will continue at 10h30 "Man of the Moment "@King Vuka - EFF is funded by the Italian tobacco smuggler Khumbuzile - They didn't know then but they know NOW that they were funded by a thug. @King Vuka - So you agree that the EFF funder is a thug but you assume that a thug gave EFF clean money? You want proof that they didn't donate from dirty money to EFF? Is some of Bosasa money clean? "@King Vuka - Earlier you agreed that EFF got the money from mazotti Pretorius has an agenda to discredit Agrizzi "This Pinky went mad even yesterday when Agrizzi mentioined her name. Her tweets are all over since yesterday

I'm lost now. about this 48hrs This man is willing to give all evidence he has. Proud of this Legend. He might have some mistake there and there!!!! but this guy is giving everything he has. Wow!!!!!! K... word guys "Now people will forget everything Aggrizzi has said
Fire Moticoe,"Since following the commission there is a lot questioning us as people to the voting stations
makhosi nobhatyi,This guy has nothing new Agrizzi was well prepared to dish up all he knew about which he still doing it DA want to oust maimane 😃😃😃 I may say ANC we too scared to touch Zuma matter because he made his cabinet and and executive mostly his supporters which was very difficult to tackle these issues as you know him always play victim "We are take Anc out of Zuma pocket no one shall do what has been happening for the past 9 years Hey this press must wait "Agrizzi never make himself smatter Bring more fire Sacp is not in parliament "They grill this guy too much We all racists anyway among our race Please commissioner bring back Manyi We accept your apology Agrizzi that is white we want see when people do wrong
Sofia Sofia,HI ALLLLL is this guy for the Guptas ! ? theres no sound or is it me ? is registrations over ?
Linda ERASMUS,Financial Cost...tax payers money! Dean I was thinking the same Guptas want to come back....their competition Watson is going to jail.... "What happened now I can't believe people like this are out there to benefit from anothers life His health took a toll @Robert Russell that is so scary Oh my goodness! One person already died because of this Hearing this is so disturbing!
Dean Lambrechts,Is Agrizzi still going to testify? No sound? @rohan barnard 😂
muneri rembuluwani,I wish agrizzi continues 😘 thanks Michael.. agrizzi has lot of meat to offer in this commission ha ha ha agrizzi for premier
Mudau Rudzani,we need agrizzi agrizzi nah zondos voice is off
The Vuka Experience,Y’all think Kwesta’s voice is sexy? Listen to Zondo 😀 Enjoy Zondo’s voice because we’ll be listening to Grizzly bear soon 😂 @Yandi Masina haha you should get your mum to listen to Zondo lol "@rohan barnard no not really @robam barnard other witnesses that testified against them. "eNCA cameras kicked out SABC employees didn’t get paid that’s why there is no sound 😂 They didn’t get paid so 🤷🏾‍♂️😂 @Yandi Masina 😂 There we go Watson waned people’s pension funds too? This guy is immoral Glad Agrizzi didn’t die. @Mzalwane Mzala I’m sure they will soon float around on tweeter and Facebook. So more witnesses could come forward? "@Lew464 that’s been the case since apartheid. 30% was standard grade pass Somebody tag Barry Roux 😂 I can see my eNCA crew is here now 😂😂 "@Mzalwane Mzala I wouldn’t lean on RDP houses to lobby for the ANC my brother. Yes "@Enrico Abraham’s for the same reason white People new the NP was racist @Mzalwane Mzala yes they are fam but it’s not something you can use to Lobby. RDP houses aren’t something to write home about. "@Mzalwane Mzala talk about free education RDP "@Mzalwane Mzala same there were 6 of us in a 2 room shack. RDP we got was also 2 room "@Michael Holmes there is nothing connecting EFF to VBS. some of us read the report "@Michael Holmes "@Michale Holmes even Daily Maverick "@Michael Holmes @Michale Holmes sundiqhela kakubi srhama. Where was the EFF involved in money laundering? Or corruption? When? You’ve abandoned your VBS argument cause it’s baseless. "@Michael Mbatha I know about Mazotti. EFF got money from him once and said if he is proven to be guilty @Michale Holmes. Zuma is not Malema and Zuma didn’t make Malema. You can’t hold anyone but the NPA or Abraham’s for failing to charge Zuma. @Derek Main. No gangster introduces themselves as a gangster. EFF said they didn’t know the guy was a smuggler and he’s not been charged. They don’t take money from him nkw EFF is not charged or mentioned here but y’all still hate them. DA is involved in irregular tenders costing Tshwane millions and y’all are mum! "@Michael Mbatha... I literally just said to you the guy is yet to be convicted or proved to be a smuggler. Until then EFF is shaking privilege 😂. Anyway the party funding bill is now law. We will know where all political parties get their funding from "@michael Mbatha I hold EFF GOT MONEY FROM MAZZOTI.The point of contention is culpability. They said they weren’t aware he was suspected as a smuggler and it’s still not proven in court "@michael mbatha @Craig Heat what’s your opinion on DA supporters? In Cape Town our people still dwell in shacks under the DA whilst DA leaders have massive houses and gold 5 days a week? @Craig Heath that’s your answer to how people are living under the DA? "Agrizzi must be honest @Craig Heath and yet the apartheid government have y’all sharks and y’all continue to inherit wealth passed down!? Wuuu Shem. @Derek Main yes and that has a history. The 1652 and things got worse with BLA of 1913. Townships are the architecture of apartheid. "@Derek Main @Craig Main whites continue to dominate the private sector. 90% of the economy is controlled by them and passed around whites. I was paid R2.5k and quelaified. My white colleague paid R5k with matric @Craig Main. That shows you blacks are still economically oppressed. I had more experience and a degree and my white co worker had neither and got more than me cause she’s white. economically 👎🏾 @Yandi Masina Injalo 😂 Look at how Agrizzi looked at the people 😂😂 @weldon saayman Springboks 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😂 He’s a racist. Agrizzi wouldn’t say he’s racist if he wasn’t recorded. @Mzalwane Mzala you are right..... now they are silent "@Moira T it’s not being used a scapegoat Agrizzi you can’t be racist even in your home! R50 Million The attorneys will be struck off the roll

Eslon Eslon,So Bosasa was keeping large amounts of money in their premises to be able to dispatch R 300000 every month to Zuma and Dudu Myeni? So they were allowed to keep so much cash in their possession? Cross examination will get nothing out of this guy I don't care whether he was stealing together and what have you. I appreciate the fact that he decided to blow the whistle for the sake of saving the country from the rot "@Bekhi "@Phllip Moshapo "We don't care about the media The media are trying to divert attention and cast doubts in Agrizzi. They are sour simply bcos he implicated them so they had to publish a retaliating article to appease themselves... The media is welcoming to try their luck but we will never believe their nonsense It's the same media that fictitiously wrote that Floyd receive VBS money while a legitimate investigation report done by advocate Motau never mention his name Evidence leader seems to be rough in his questions today "@Desmond Masiela "@Moira T Pretorius is pushing Agrizzi to contradict himself "Pretorius That was better by the chair bcos it's not about racism but whether his testimony is credible and factual I think Pretorius was wrong and bias to conclude that Agrizzi was motivated racism to come testify...
