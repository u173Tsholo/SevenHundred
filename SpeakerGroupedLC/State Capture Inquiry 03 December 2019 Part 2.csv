Rob Weightman,Or they‚Äôre just dumb
Phillip Cwazibe,I have doubts with Mr Baloyi's version. Mr Baloyi is getting entangled. Mr Baloyi is about to twist his version. "@ makhosi nobhatyi ‚Äã & @ Andrew adams @ makhosi nobhatyi ‚Äã he is caught out nje. @ Paul Buchel ‚ÄãI that grin is after swallowing fact that he is caught out. Mr Baloyi is now Stellingrading the matter @ Sthakathi Khumalo kumnyama ebusweni benkawu.
Rob Nel,"Must remember "It was in a motor accident
makhosi nobhatyi,Mr Baloyi is lying Tjooo "Baloyi didn‚Äôt have place for him Answer sir Mr Baloyi started to behave like Zuma and manyi Why would want to have documentation if you know there was minutes "Uyaxoka there was a meeting Where is memorandums then mr Baloyi?

Sam Maloka,How do you cosign for the minute of a meeting where you were not present?
