Indoda Yamaqiniso,As we wait😎 🏄🏿‍♂️ 🚣🏿‍♂️ 🏇🏿 🤸🏿‍♂️ Zondo eats too much die man🤐😖 Who has electricity and who do not? "Cyril Ramaphosa amended the references to allow these people to lie and never go to jail for it. He was actually protecting himself ...the terms of reference "@Nelly Mfeka They apologize like Telkom Customer Care Zondo doesn't play. He'd play too nice while engulfing you😎 He should be in retirement or running a farm. Do you see that the wars we think we are fighting are not ours?🤷🏿‍♂️ You pay a bond for 450 000 house for 20 years when it was paid off within 10 years🤣🤣🤣 White people would one day need to wake up and realize that we are actually together on the issue of land. "Not White people needs a true leader who will open their eyes because the one they have are puppets of Israel. "Yes. It belongs to Africans "Being African for whites is conditional "I don't see white people exposing white racists. Instead Black people actually don't hate white people. We are the greatest people they've ever seen. We just want them to be consistent and be realistic. They're just pretenders who always criticize everythin "Yes "We don't talk about FW de Klerk corruption Why are white people defensive on land issue when they themselves do not have land. Only a handful of white families own farms completely. She wanted to be famous The banks are criminals and you should not be buying land from the banks. Where did they get the land from? You should be leasing the land from the state at lesser price and get discounts based on your harvests and what you make from the farm. @jeevan singh those calculations are flawed. Banks should never own the land. Where and how did they get the land? They're leading her for her to expose herself and for everyone to see through her lies. "Yes Zuma will leave this commission as laughing as always The obsession with Zuma is shocking. "The commission doesn't get the records from the Guptas Obviously these people were paid and deceived to lie "Is Vodacom Thuli Madonsela is lap-puppy for Johann Rupert. "I ask you a question that you fail to answer and all in a sudden you have no time to ""asinine"" people like myself.😂😂" "It is state owned and it's not a ""government department""" "Vodacom has an agenda. Remember The state is not the government. The state is made up of: The state is not the government. The state is made up of the 1 Executive 2 the Judiciary 3 The Parliament Know your politics "The government is falling under one of the arms of the state @Jeevan and that is? 🤣 "Vusumuzi "Guess what The Secretary of the Commission is on special leave after it emerged that he's captured and now ask yourself who else? 🤔 Whybis is this guy dancing? Cameras can give you fever and the foreknowledge that you're live on TV😂 They shouldn't be afraid because the EFF will never ever took over the government. "Was the ""state"" ever captured? If so "Too many sober questions needs to be asked out of this madness. But "If the state was ever captured Zondo is now driving This lawyer is brutal😂😂😂 "Not intimidating her Cross-examinations are not the same as nursing a cookie. It's more the same as impounding it🍆🍑💦💦💦 I put it to you... 😎 We've just had a lawyer🏄🏿‍♂️🚣🏿‍♂️ They thought it would be easy "Who has Zuma killed before Zondo🤣🤣🤣🤣😂 This commission is gonna be lit It might even unseat the president People's personal hate for Zuma exposes their stupidity here on the comments She's not lying when she proves to everyone that she's lying. Live on TV...😂😂😂 People lie for what motives kanti? 🤷🏿‍♂️ They just want Zuma guilty😂 What is a state? "If the state was captured "So Ungaphikisani nesiwula esiphethe iboza "Why ""14 December"" 🤔" Can't remember the gender🤯 That dude is actually you """... I concede""" Mr. Siwela is at work and you're busy staring at the screen calling him Uncle Ruckus He's an embarrassment because he doesn't make them fart better Some people are important on the comments here. They can even tell who they want and do not want to see... Talking about being a legend in your own mind🤔 Hamba!! A fat gotz She even got a donation from United States so that she finish off. What do you call that? An office of the Public Protector in South Africa getting compromised in that way.... 🤔 uSithole i-network idonsa kahle la kuye? Senzeni pho thina. Go!! 🤷🏿‍♂️ A Commander In Chief is a Commander of all Armed Forces in the country and Julius is none of that. He's a CIC in his own mind. The attitude is based on what is a Commander In Chief. Why are you fools laughing at that word? Hearing it for the first time? Isithakathi umtshikizane🤯😂😂 Lento etshikiza endunu uma kushona ilanga "Go back to Europe

nhlanhla zwane,mentor 🙈 Mentor is an embarrassment. Lies have short legs Mentor must tell us who paid her to lie "Vodacom Zondo is wasting tax payers money with this women Real criminals and liars will be exposed in the Zondo commission...Zuma warned us Thuli Madonsela must explain to the public why she believed Mentor as a credible witness Why Thuli Madonsela failed to investigate Mentor's version of testimony🤔 Guptas were used to cover up real state capture by WMC. Their sin was to invade the territory which belonged to WMC We can't even compare BOSASA to the Guptas She is disputing Ms Kaunda's version yet she has 3 version of her communication with Ms Kaunda "She can't explain her 3 version of communication with Ms Kaunda but has odecity to question airlines She lied about Siyabonga Cwele out of embarrassment she conceded that Mr Cwele was not a chair person of the portfolio committee. Those who still believe in Mentor are mad themselves. Those who still believe in Mentor lies are sick mentally as well like their hero Mentor Mentor and her handlers planned to nail Zuma unfortunately their puppet mentor is embarrassing them They were blinded by their hatred for Zuma and forgot to close all the loopholes Those who still believe Mentor are sick themselves How can you believe a person who has no many discrepancies in her statement "Airlines There is nothing could be found which corresponds with Mentor's statement She can't remember who was part of the meeting but can remember all the features at Guptas house Thanx Mr Siwela we were not aware that Mentor failed to inform Thuli that she was forced to remove the name of the President The fact remains that nothing corresponds with Mentor's testimony Zuma's haters are so disappointed with Vytjie Mentor Thuli rushed to finalised the state capture report before investigating Mentor's testimony Gotz is Ms Mentor's lawyer @Mbali Buthelezi.... The hatred for Zuma was too much they forgot to close all the loopholes In Mentor's recordings she only gave Motolo something to drink. If he was with another person why she did not offer the other person something to drink Hamba Mentor you wasted our time and our tax for nothing SA media is embarrasses as well shame their trusted witness fumbled
Israel Z Khumalo,So much much is spent on entertaining Fakey's nonsense
Lorrenzo Mokgosana,"To an extent i believe Mentor corruption is rife in SA probably service provided were paid to delete the records @nhlanhla zwane she is not lying probably the manupulated the records "I'm telling you now the truth will come out  "@Indoda Yamaqiniso responding with insults shows how stupid you are  "@Indoda Yamaqiniso hayike i really ain't got time for asinine people like you LOL CHina is coming sooner than we think
Niematullah Rakeep,Remember she is or was the whistleblower. much of the Public Protector's report stemmed from her statements. There must be a reason for them entertaining her lies. This woman should truly be charged with treason She is another Narcasist of note. The Truth remains the truth no matter how you want to twist it. She will later suffer nervous breakdown. The whole Commission is expensive and a waste of Taxpayers money Take a break! "narcissist/ˈnɑːsɪsɪst/nouna person who has an excessive interest in or admiration of themselves.""narcissists who think the world revolves around them""" she can remember so many things about the chairs the walls the toilet but she seems not to recall a conversation It would be much easier to reply yes or no. IF you have nothing to hide. "Everyone is lying She must PLEASE not write another book No Holy Cows followed by No Holy Bull💩 They must allow her to speak more lies/truth In my opinion I do not think Siwela questioning was entirely useless I feel ESKOM No more Power niks meer Krag vir haar.

Bheki Mdletshe,So Mentor is disputing everything. Even cellphone records The problem is that Mentor is wasting time and the lawyer was not allocated sufficient time.

Mhlanguli Dlodlo,"This commission is FANTASTIC when it delves into CORRUPTION When is Mr 600Million Jonas coming here?
Nelson Musoliwa,Logs can be created in computers so Kaunda must explain where and when did she get tese transactions. I think Mentor is not lying because she contacted many people in this regard so she cant lie involving so many people As for SAA records who was the CEO then and if state security agencies can be destroyed as evidence at Mokgoro omm indicated so beneficiaries of state capture can not give up without a fight How can she lie when she even attempted to open a case and why her statement corrupted as we know what has became of Hawrks This advocate doesnt sound objective she sound subjective in that she takes delight in proving Mentor wrong all the time
Amanda Bentsile,Phika lo mama sove uve ngathi unento yokwenza nasekhaya Can he unbotton labhatyi kwase kwa minxwa @Felix Muyoba he cant breathe uyamva Siwela is so nervous Guys look at the guy who is behind mr Siwela with a chiskop he is shocked ukuthi dude why did go up there Paraf Their tired Mr Siwela sounds like hs just had a tongue piercing dilly dallying
