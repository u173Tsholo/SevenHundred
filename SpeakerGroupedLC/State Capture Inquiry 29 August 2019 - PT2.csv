Anthony Ramasike,you are right @salmaan and very brainy @salmaan i would hate to b interogated by her @salmaan see what's happening with this accountant @salmaan no chance what so ever for a poor guy
Ewald Kruger,"Very much so üòÄ and she keeps her cool much better than I would've been able to @Salmaan Abrahams Well-said! @Moshoeu Mabusela ‚Äã She displays emotional intelligence very well.

Moshoeu Mabusela,She displays emotional intelligence very well. Excellent trait. @Salmaan Abrahams . managing your emotions when challenged is a skill. we all can do well if we learn. "She is focused on playing the ball "@Yolo More. I agree This guy used personal cash as entry in business accounts. Not acceptible from a CA.
Eddie Neluonde,a CA nohow

Yolo More,Hofmeyer is one of the best in country. She is our finest. Yes. She does not get emotional. She just makes sense.
Rob Nel,She is actually HOFMEYR "Watch the witness "Looking at your scree Zondo is on his left. Check his glance the OTHER direction "Obviously
Lourens De Jager,"if you have to pay it back at some stage  this one is ready for jail chair bring in the cuffs and take him away trying to repair the damage this lawyer trying to patch up the holes "zondo  "if its not a loan  arrogant lawyer lawyer ask a question and let the canary sing his own song not yours prove that the call was not planned
Matthew Moyo,she is puting the man in a tight corner by trying to make him confess that it was a loan this really was not a loan because the money would be returned immediately on demand l really wouldn't hire this one some said we must expropriate his degree kkƒ∑kkkƒ∑k.l agree with that leading meaning the witness is put in a situation in which he can't answer questions in his own way because the questioner leads him to answer in a certain way
Phillip Cwazibe,@Lourens De Jager it is so.

I would have confessed to something I ddnt do if I was his position. Hope the Hawks are ready with a docket @Lourens De Jager "With The KPMG saga and Anoj Singh now this one You are onto something @Cerebis That‚Äôs what they do when they caught out... they blame the questioning and the commission She‚Äôs using our taxes outside the country. The AFU must attach her assets Damage control He‚Äôs telling the witness‚Äôs story He is arguing like Dali Mpofu Dali Mpofu believed his argument is the rcorrect argument and every should agree with him While doing so Dali fails to support his arguments with law @Tholithemba Ntsele My point exactly @thando cezula Yes @Thando Nkutha Now his witness can only agree with him @Matthew Moyo without saying much Natasen @salmaan Abrahams She can‚Äôt get a second bite @Thembelani Mayoli Hope he‚Äôs next @Comcerned South African The chair is buying time now There was no due diligence needed. They both knew what they were doing was wrong. His leading questions aren‚Äôt helping. Maybe that‚Äôs why the Chair isn‚Äôt bothered The Hawks must arrest this man... finish &klaar Eish... @Mxolisi Buthelezi. Apartheid cops arrested and killed innocent people in their holdings. This lawyer is trying to use the fees he received from this Accountant Who are you @Born free? Are you for real? Do you know Brian van Wyk @Thembelani Mayoli?

Diana Sekatane,he is lying through his teeth. S.

Born free,He should be a addressing Chairman Zondo when he answers questions. Or at least looking at the Judge Very well thank you @I am free üñê I think he entered the arena to wrap up the cross examination In the morgue He is professional Ms Hoffmeyer was not making enough progress You will have to pay the ANC Crooks for and you won't get any land for free He looks like Doctor Evil Poverty breeds criminals So Zuma I get to keep my land Yes Zuma I originate from the Khoisan Tr I come from the original Bushmen No our Khoisan ancestors would be crawling in their graves. Khoisan one and only true South African Land belongs only to the Khoisan The Bantu and Zulus came from other countries in Africa Not South Africa Only the Khoisan were here first Haha Zuma they might become white Zuma you are a Ulundian I smell sewerage Coming for Nkandla Haha yes Ghandi that one he was always in a nappy He looks Like MAGAT MA GHANDI I like this advocate Ah Zuma you are a parasite This advocate is getting more from the witness Nothing wrong with this lawyer he is doing what Ms Hoffmeyer was struggling with. He represents that African Lady that has gone into hiding Van Wyk black as the ace of spades The Boer is the hand that feeds your face..

Isaac Patsa,This lawyer is very arrogant and disrespectful Exactly my point the excuse that he was under the impression that he was signing accurate statements is a lot of bull. That's why we have cases such as steinhoff and others

Kevin Simon,Anyway if DPCI haven't spoken to him then they can't be investigating the matter. Why has no one raised this with the DCJ? How big was the R9m received from van Wyk relative to Neo's other income. Hawks probably don't need his evidence. (Hopefully) Then he can be prosecuted too. [doubt it though] Do you believe you should not be prosecuted? NO This guy should be added to the case and let the judge decide in the trial. Where is Brain van Wyk?? Brian not Brain Sorry!

Why Zondo allow this to go on? ü§îü§îü§îü§îHow does an accused person bring in his or her own lawyer to question him on behalf of the persecutor? It‚Äôs very bizarre what is going on and Zondo silent Zondo is stupid; last time he let Sikhakhane to do worse than this for Zuma so now CJ have to swallow this unacceptable model Fantastic to be brought to court and then given the chance to have your own lawyer replace the persecutor against you. Would Jacob Zuma next time offer the chance to have his own lawyer questioning him on behalf of the leading witness like today? What is realy Zondo doing here today? Is not this a play to lose case therefore wasting public money? Can anyone explain the logic of Zondo allowing an accuser being question by his lawyer of behalf of the persecutor?
Khaya Nomoyi,Ignorance of the law is no excuse. So many leading questions. Are we still in re-examination or what? He is very arrogant and has come with the attitude to this commission and is direspecting the DCJ. He wants to do things his own way and is very rude. I am sure he was once a policeman.

A crook. "This remainds me of the proverb that says that ""A drawing man will catch a straw"" I am sure this lawyer is really desperate to save his client."
