cassim suleman,too much for hofmeyr..give others a chance kwa dugusa service protests we all going to pay for the looting money gone and blown..most likely in overseas havens..no chance of getting it back.best punishment is jail sentence.. but npa should act immediately..based on zondo comm life sentence traded against return of moneys..then reduced sentence ancyl and all anc structures interested in positions of power so they can loot no ..dont bring zulu in picture..across the board in s africa..just that the looting is related to demographics.so if done in eastern cape..the xhosa etc magashule not xulu..he biggest culprit yip systematic desstruction of the fabric of a black.. no not revenge..but have to address the injustices of apartheid..cant do nothing and ignore how the black nation was destroyed. what is happening from black population is as a result of ANC not addressing the imbalance properly..they looted insteaf ya unfortunately we minority is getting the backlash of poor ANC no ways..but cause and action..is where we are.. the ANC did not embrace minorities into the structures..we have become isolated and marginalised.. tough to solve now..body is rotten.and worse to follow.. true yip mandela warned against black domination over white. if we as minority are suffering think of poor masses..they suffering worse.poor education..no facilities..transport.wats their future cant do that..very difficult ancyl is a dumb structure i agree ..but against bee..i think state should be the bee partner..as the money can be spent for benefit the country bee only benefitting elite.
Thembisa Odendaal,@ntuli seriously we don't want to be accused that we are not supporting our own but I'm afraid this girl did not even attempt public speaking at school it's really not fun watching her @bongani ntuli you are very kind you must always be suspicious when they have a postgraduate diploma from the UK nogal what a farce @thabo vuma no she was told at the legotla to be the acting CEO makes me sick guys I want to know what about Coleman Andrews who sold all Sara's assets then given over 200million golden handshake does nothing happen to him before he became CEO he bankrupted a few airlines
clive oconnell,A lesson on how to spread the loot without a quote for BEE friends Maybe she‚Äôs preparing for üöøZuma üîÆüîÆCan you see into the minds of NPA ? @Musa Mabunda With a large percentage going into Gupta and pals pockets "@Born free @Trava Matrix Too Late
Yolo More,"As long as it is not miss 9th month Miss nineth month must not come back. She is always frustrating the chair. She must be kept busy with administration. "Musa Mabunda Plus we want to hear their side of story here before they go to jail. "Musa Mabunda üòÇüòÇüòÇ I don't think Dudu Myeni is right upstairs. She is a nyaopist. Am I the only one who is fed up by these hackers that keep on poping "Siyabonga Dladla "Thando Nkutha "Margareth Waterboer The Doctor from Friday must come back and finish his wrap up that was cut "That's why I do not take serious all the RET revolutionaries. If you follow them closely
prince efalao,morning
Sindiswa Moolman,I have the same feeling @Thembisa Odendaal
Born free,WOW. So many executives were appointed through Dudu Myeni. I believe implicated persons will have an opportunity to respond at l this commission . I am sure indictments are in the process. "Yes and we have to pay 9% more for electricity State Capture is only an Enquiry not an Investigation. Judge Zondo will compile his report and recommendations as to the implicated parties. It will be up to The NPA to take this further. Yip racist. BEE is racist against a minority. BEE is unlawful because it is racist and biased against the minority of whites. No where in the world do you have BEE and transformation against a minority group based on their skin colour. BEE Is a Racist nonsensical system. It has destroyed all African countries. This is not practised in Botswana.. a merit system works. Borrowed Money and taxpayers money has been STOLEN We will fight the ANC in a Constitutional Court. Cry Out Beloved Country No Investor confidence = No jobs This government won't dictate to me who I employ BEE in SOE's is managed by criminal government employees at the highest order. Who wants to employ Zulus.. they are idle. Nepotism and Corruption qualifies you a job in government sectors. yes super relaxed BEE has not solved poverty because of government looting and mismanagement of funds.. which was meant to assist poverty issues. 11.16 am It is tea time
Vuyo Saleni,hayi sandiswa nam ndicinga njalo
Musa Mabunda,Can someone help me understand why Dudu Myeni and Yakhe Kwinana aren't arrested yet? Where's Adv Batohi "@Yolo More eish "@Yolo More we will hear their side of story in court. This whole evidence will have to play it out over again in a court of law still @Owen yes but the same witnesses will still have to give same evidence in court Remember the NPA will also do its own investigation and they will merely confirm the commission investigators' The commission should enlist the services of Adv Adila Hassim to work with Adv Hofmeyr. She's equally ferocious and extremely competent Adv. Dirk Groenewald can also do a great job "Zondo himself told law enforcement not to wait for the commission Adv Hassim is ferocious Maggie "BEE is meant to redress the imbalances of the past How is it unlawful? You can argue it is unfair but not unlawful @Born free unfortunately apartheid benefited only whites and to correct that we have to apply the opposite hence the BEE She was power high and drunk "@Derek @Francel van Eeden is it necessary to redress the past imbalances? @Francel van Eeden okay what would you suggest? "@Derek Main how can we go about it then
Floyd Ramoshaba,@Yolo More These guy will never implicate them selves
Sipho Owen Ndhlovu,"musa mabunda
Tina Carvalho,hi im just in but id like to ask what hapens to the money gone . will it be returned and made to be returned with people being held to account is there no sales and made to pay back system only zulus? click on three little dots and report and block much learning ahead. im going back to work
Norman Zwane,@Musa Mabunda Adv Hassim handled quite a few sessions in 2018 and she was ferocious How the likes of Myeni can pull the race card at the most inappropiate time.

Mqondisi Maphophe,This is the reality of state capture....... Anyone that disrupts the previlege of minority is Corrupt thats the narrative and thats what we shouldnt be fighting if we had the land
Derek Main,@Musa Mabunda Apartheid ver 2.0 @cassim suleman So now it's revenge? @cassim suleman And now we have systematic oppression of whites. How is that right? @Musa Mabunda I think we would have been a lot further along that road if the cadres didn't steal all the money. Whites are being made scapegoat's for the ANC failures. @cassim suleman Like I said Apartheid ver 2.0 @cassim suleman Are you excusing their criminality? @Musa Mabunda By perpetuating apartheid??? @Musa w is unfair discrimination based on race. Isnabunda What we have no What we have now is unfair discrimination based on race. Isn't that what apartheid was? @Thulani Bukani Read my previous comment RE poor benefitting "@cassim suleman Exactly my point "@cassim suleman What you are saying (and what is currently being done) is : ""We are going to fix the effects of discrimination by further discrimination"". Don't you see how bizarre that is?" @Thulani Bukani Of course there is but it's not a quick fix solution. They should be encouraged and mentored to gain the necessary knowledge and experience to sit on the board. @Thulani Bukani Just putting unqualified persons in positions they cannot meaningfully contribute to will just collapse the company. How does tha help anyone? @Thulani Bukani Exactly - they just want the benefits without contributing to the well-being of the company. @Thulani Bukani My concern is not really for the fat cats wanting to be on boards - my concern is for the vast majority of our people living in abject poverty. BBBEE was meant to solve that problem. "@Thulani Bukani But the greedy cadres want it all. They don't care a jot for the poor. As far as they're concerned "@rosalind gerber With all the greed these days @Thulani Bukani And that greed knows no colour either.
RAMESHAN ACHARI,no money my family not keep other family my fmiy not other cantre not other state
Robert Russell,@Born free ..... Namibia recently kicked BEE to touch because it was not working and was deemed to be a racist practice IS very arrogant Only 14 days to go...... Getting lots of popcorn for those 4 days..... the demise of.... JZ.... let Kate Hoffmeyer loose on him
Francel van Eeden,Musa my point of view is not to take revenge that is self destructive this is what is currently happening what the previous goverment did is now practiced by current government Musa I do agree with you there 200% no question but how we adress it is the question Instead of focusing on the current and previous injustices as our goal post lets stand together and build a future let the injustices be our warning light what not to do and what to prevent we focuss so much on politics which angers all off uss. Remember we put the power in their hands lets take our power and use it for the benifet of our country not a political party we must stop waiting for politicians to solve the problems we must take responcibility and start solving it ourselves but cant happen if we keep on pointing fingers
Margareth Waterboer,"@Cassim Suleman "Me too "@yolo "Very tiring üò∏üò∏@Thando
Raymond Fitzgerald,gees this goes soo to the ground I hope they can rubbish out from management to the floor workers no Miss Hofmeyer today this lady does not inspire any confidence that is why Chair has to get involved
