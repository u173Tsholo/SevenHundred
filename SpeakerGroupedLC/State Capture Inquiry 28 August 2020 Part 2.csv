Bulelani Nyingwa,"Adv Pretorius makes you feel comfortable atleast he is not wearing shades like our friend on Wednesday I am learning alot from these old crook's ignorance. They failed to question or investigate before making important decisions. They think the law is studpid "@thando cezula "@Phillip Cwazibe  I do believe DCJ will turn beast mode when this whole thing is done. Makunyiwe once. "@a b c  "They have no idea what that is They did not request fro it so let me let a mil slide "@Noel Smit  Surely he might even leave with the mic "@Margareth Waterboer  All these guys have puppet masters "@John Everitt  "@zip reeper  "@Zalisile Ndzala If you ever read the Billion Dollar Whale book you will understand what almost happened with the ZUPTAS

Frank Jordaan,The man is struggling It is like pulling teeth. No wonder he did not want to testify. Coco jip. The actions of a desperate man And now the mask is back. Eisj that poor microphone Sorree Mbuso😜😜😜 Please for your own health sake just come clean and tell the judge who forced you to sign of on this tender. Is this man still the HOD in the Free State. "The more he waffles Please check his heart rate. City lol😝😂😂😂 Stop the waffling and admit your wrongdoing. Signed an extention of millions without ever looking at crucial documentation. And now he is trying to shift accountability. Agree James. Serepa agree.
Derek Govender,THERE WE GO HISTORICAL FACT THEY SHOULD BE GREATFUL THAT THEY HAVE HOUSES AND NOT SHACKS Yes certificate he made himself @Salmaan yes exactly YES SALMAAN @salmaan so they thought unfortunately only a few ate the pie @Bizana WHY NOT??? Adv Pretorius probably regrets taking on this task.It's as though he is questioning a brick wall!!! Zandile Gumede to still get full salary as ANC asks her to step aside - pending corruption case - SO ANOTHER COMMISSION WILL BE SET UP FOR THIS??? @GHOST I SHOULD THINK SO "Hawks swoop as municipality loses R9m "Paying SA's debt could cost more than healthcare spend @SAL SA His findings mean absolutely niks!!! @ghost this is a way of life in SA. @ghost we will eat all the crumbs that they throw away We should have brought outside experts from another country to investigate this mess and thieves.By now am sure we would have had closure. @Naledi yes but am talking about investigators from outside it's 5 pm time to adjourn too boring @SAL SA was this thief not tired and too old to apply his mind when he was stealing @greatnation no this old man will meet all his comrades at the chisa nyama just now. @lovejoy the police are just as corrupt @ABC one has to say it the way you see it Cheers guys have a great weekend all!!!

Coco Thoabala,This guy is going to explode soon True Frank......thats why he thought enlisting the services of Dali Mpofu would get hi out of this mess Dali was just acting for his fat cheque payment he just confirmed that Ace knows about this
N.G.,lol this guy brand new He knows they taking him somewhere... its like when the lookout guy saw the iceberg on the titanic... too late They fought... tax payers money = booty They taking way too long... when is this guy going to start saying “I don’t remember” ? Ntseku had the whole file even took it home. He still doesn’t remember... Exactly Ndumieh Ntseku was a joke... glasses and all 😎 We still trying establishing what is “new” ... too much legal jargon today. @Zalisile exactly... he thinks he is leading them 🤣 He needs sunglasses... should have borrowed Ntseku’s 😎 We can see right through his soul now ... no sunglasses 😎 "They launders Touching the mic is his way of controlling his nerves... the man is nervous. The Adv. is taking way too long. Hope this doesn’t carry on beyond today. Knew this Adv. wasn’t going to finish today. He is not “putting it to him”... continue for 1hour on this trajectory... 🎤 Ace probably has video tapes of them all partying in Zuma’s fire pool 🤔 must be something similar to the Jeffrey Epstein saga Ok the break is over for that mic. Back to getting shoved around 🎤😷 Pretorius must get some tips from Hofmeyer on how to create a more intense evidence build-up... he is so monotonous... This commission will recommend prosecution based on these proceedings? all he knows is work = money = value value = quality/cost .... the more you reduce the cost the more value. But don’t explain this to him... accounting officer... huh! irregular expenditure is a governance problem... this man is confused... They confusing him... Zondo is trying to spoon feed him. By hacking his corrupt mind...

Lennon Marks,same school as Zuma and the guy who could or would not remember or did not know
Guruswami Venkatasen,"he reminds me of the one that said""please protect me from yourself """ KZN PEC reverses its decision on Zandele Gumede. Do they still have some credibility left The service provider makes a profit of over R100 mil because you erred in applying the correct provisions of the regulation. Still not in jail? Ace made me do it Politicians make sure that they employ persons of this calibre so that they can be manipulated explain to him what predates mean. Not sure whether sars is on top of their game.Ndzeku was getting away with tax on the corrupt payment. Picked up by Hofmeyer The government rushed through the asbestos survey because of the dangers it posed.Five years down the line there is no initiative to remove the asbestos. This mandala is babalased and hence Dali's application for a postponement

a b c,Some Dillon guy... He's causing serious chaos in the eNCA chat... everyone's gone bananas... lol @Saalman Abrahams that is so true... here people don't take things so personally... people have gotta relax... Besides... all the funny people are on this chat... not eNCA Lol I'm telling you this guy is going to go home with that microphone @Salty Crack 😂😂😂 @Riaan DW for sure! Does anyone here object to the witness and the mic being united in holy matrimony...? I now pronounce him husband and mic... you may... whatever the heck he's gonna do with it when he gets hime... He's doing a brilliant job incriminating himself... @wendy hardy lol that's what I was thinking too @N.G lol the truth is blinding him... @Khanyi. AgeGracefully I'm glad you came back to the darkside lol 😂😂 Your father is about to bite the dust son... Buy him a new mic and tell him to not think of stealing that one... And some don't have any type of remembering If only we had whistle-blowers... too bad everyone in that party is corrupt... This guy could put a child hyped up on sugar to sleep... 😂😂😂 that mic is suffering @thando cezula you'd be a hero if COULD hear him... @Riaan DW 😂 The mic may need to see a therapist after this... "That mic will not be there in the morning... it will be ""missing""" Naledi Barron... it's weird I am not seeing any of your posts... but people are responding to you... @Kerry that's the strangest part... I'm on live chat... @Kerry and I never block people... so really not sure what happened... I'm not even sure if she can see mine... @Kerry Oh well... @thando lol Imagine that Pretorius is quite gentle and he's already frying the old man in oil... now imagine Hofmeyer... Ace we know where you live... and also can I have some of your money please @Riaan DW no no... now you'll scare him away 😂😂 Hey look one of Ace's secretaries... get him... @Riaan true lol He can make the sun go down by just talking to it... Yeah they changed him into a sloth... He's falling asleep Yeah... Cyril doesn't need to steal... the only problem is he's having a hard time bringing order in the ANC "I miss Ray Charles... his ""I don't remember"" song was more entertaining..." Mr Mic will enter the books as the most BORING witness in this commission... @Thoko lol Oh yeah... Cuba Goodings is back... Give that guy a cup of coffee during the break... Nah that mic now has PTSD... there's nothing we can do for it... @Zolisa 😂 You'll be asleep forever tgen Ain't nobody getting arrested... we're all stuck in the endless cycle of corruption people... it's such a sad world... The mic just can't take it anymore... This guy has enough waffles to compete with Cinnabon...waffling all day long @Melvern Hannies I wish I could... but his son is apparently in the chat... we should ask him lol That mic may tell you he's doing alright... but no people... he's not going alright... he's hurting inside @Riaan DW 😂😂 Ace is watching and packing his bags... This commission has seen a whole lot of bus accidents... especially from Ray... he threw his entire family under the bus You know what would be more interesting and important than this commission? An actual prosecution of those convicted... otherwise this doesn't accomplish much... They should open up a can of Hofmeyer next time... "Dang... we're here for some ""I don't like your tone""... not this boring stuff... they should bring back Hofmeyer and Ray..." So we won't get whistle-blowers easily... @Nthabiseng exactly... and also a waste of money Let the old man return to his kids... and just let him take the mic with him *grand kids They cooked this guy so badly that now we want him to be released... They've turned the old man into a spatlho... "He doesn't even know who he is anymore The old man's legal team should be fired for letting them mistreat the elderly this way 😂😂 😂😂😂😂 @Lesley Gove eish... if only @Riaan DW 😂😂😂 The old man thought he could run away from the long arm of justice... he forgot that his legs just ain't what they used to be @Derek lol there's just no silver lining with you 😂 The old timer will live to see another day... @Really?... I'll watch that one too @Linda @Derek true... Until next time cousins...

Mlndeli Gamede,I don't see the benefits of this because no one will be held accountable at the end
Nondumiso Soko,eNCA stream has annoying peeps nzeku denied receiving 2.5 mil in his bank account regardless of bank statements provided..🤣🤣 so you can say I don't remember but Hofmeyer made sure he remembers.... I'm proud of that woman✊🏿 apparently Mr nzeku was a drug dealer and went to jail many times... he's probably not afraid of jail the Eastern Cape looters must be next too much corruption there I understand why he didn't want to speak xem
