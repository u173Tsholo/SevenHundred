jeevan singh,wow what The ANC must fall come next election. only idiots will vote them into poor. Zuma is the downfall of the ANC. DA WILL GOVERN Malema is the one who got Zuma appointed as the President and Malema is the one who got him removed. mmm Who is running the ANC. Money grabbing done. now land grabbing begins. Then kiikking out of the country will begin. Get prepared now. last week Zuma got a recording contract. his first song with Dudu goes like this. I'm dancing in the dark. With you between my arms. PERFECT. ü§£ü§£ü§£üï∫ The politians implicated must step down. All Bosasa contract must be terminated. Then the NPA must start prosecuting. All Politicians assets must be seized and held by the state. wow he stole money from Bosasa. Doom Ruler. Now there's a twist in the tale. Magda meaning Magda. I know that. we all know that. Magda. The evidence appears overwhelming. so the authorities needs to act on the evidence and make the charges and arrests.
FRANS SEBOLA,U can say that again....Woooow Bosasa is a cleaning/catering and security company
Stephan Dolk,Just conne ed. wow what. Just connected
Ewald Kruger,Just missed that! What happened guys? Let me block @Itumeleng Mokoena. He has a runny tummy People who say stupid things like you without any reasons? @Emmanuel Phaladi ‚Äãthis guy is a joke

S Mhlabase Msibi-Gordon,the rot runs so deep in South Africa "i'm in Hanoi jack sparrow what do you think the demand for land is? but Peter Sant it is members of the anc who either perpetuated or turned blind eye on corruption. they have been entrusted by the majority of south africans yet they betray but Agrizzi has at not point disputed being in it. he'shere because he is a whistle-blower. he will have his day in criminal court
Prescott Smith's Fly Fishing Academy,watching from The Bahamas I hope South Africans vote out the ANC so they can have to true economic INDEPENDENCE . get their land and control of their MINERAL RESOURCES "Michael Michael well the root is the same we face here. the COLONIAL structures means they only gave you political INDEPENDENCE "Jack sparrow The U.S. "Jack sparrow MINERAL RESOURCES comes in many forms. it's not just gold "When South Africans vote vote out this level of corruption and take control of the their land Jack sparrow I am quite sure you fully understand the history of Africa and Europe. They are all through Africa only because of Land and mineral RESOURCES. "Jeff towell blacks are not in CONTROL in South Africa "Jeff towell  Jack sparrow beleive you me I am speaking truly from a neutral point all the way from The Bahamas. we are faced with the same economic apartheid system.
Themba Zulu,"Anywhere where corruption is discussed
Michael Michael,Prescot no ways
Jack Sparrow,@Prescott Smith‚Äã mineral resources aren't in big demand nowadays "@S Mhlabase Msibi-Gordon demand for land is high @Prescott Smith with the price of resources at the momeny there's no point in taking it out of the ground @Prescott Smith who in the world is truly free? "@Prescott Smith I'd love to see the end of the ANC @nichol shange you may notice that nobody's taking your bait...

Lusalobe Kabamba,This is scary. it appears that the country was not only captured by the Guptas
Ramasodi Sekgothe,The guptas are just a fraction of the corruption that took place during jacob's reign. Bosasa is corrupt.
Kids Collie,Lol Dudu sent text messages to ENCA about todays testimony "@Thando Nkutha ""For the record I have never had a meeting at Bosasa offices with Gavin.

This thing is really dangerous "Doom Ruler for me the example of the lawyer he was implicating now about towing the line Hence my comment to tread carefully. "Ndikho Mangisa He is not a hero "He is no hero Magda Seguin but it doesnt make him a hero "He has been stealing money with Bosasa but now we have to praise him because he came foward "Eslon Eslon to be honest "I think Bosasa contracts must be returned to the state "Eslon Eslon Not even makhosi nobhatyi I understand what you mean.. but 4000 workers is too much and you know its hard to find a job today!!

Hilda Monama,dont thnk so he wont cme struu mnx
Eslon Eslon,The biggest mistake the ANC made which am sure they are regretting now was to make Jacob Zuma president They remove Thambo Mbeki simply bcos they all wanted to steal but things are now badly backfiring and the image of the party completely damaged whoever vote for the ANC after hearing all this damming revelations will be voting to further corruption and they will make fool of themselves "Bottom line this whole corruption was initiated Is there any other political parties politicians so far being largely implicated far more the ANC ones in this commission? The Malema ANC youth league must be blamed for removing an innocent Thambo and giving South Africa a crook president(Jacob Zuma) Thambo Mbeki was removed bcos he warned the ANC to be careful of making JZ the president bcos of the pending arms deals case against him at that time "Eish this Agrizzi is really brilliant "I'm not impressed by Dudu Myeni respond "@Doom Ruler Nah why should the implicated lawyer be notified? @Bongumenzi So you're worried about the implicated lawyer safety or? @Bongumenzi There must be a serious and robust sensitization of society not to vote for the ANC at all bcos of all this mess@Ndou Fhati ...bcos ANC will never clean itself up properly
Amanda Bentsile,@Eslon Eslon thats true because it's all because of him sebuchitheka bugayiwe When looks the other side what/who is he looking at?
