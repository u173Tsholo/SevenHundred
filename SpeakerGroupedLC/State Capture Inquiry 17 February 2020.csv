She got a bit emotional about a witness who has received death threats "@anya van loggerenberg Yes @Mbuso Ndlovu The witness protection has only now been put in place. JZ had 24 hour protection and as far as I know still has protection paid for by us. @Yolo More Do you know that as a fact or are you guessing? @Bongani Shibambu Thalente Cyril Myeni "Yes Yes "@Pastor J Yup "@Diana Sekatane Yes Looks like it. @Horte Guzman Carrillo ? @Pheladi Lamola I agree. "For people who don't know @BeachDude420 Peters 👍 "@Sthakathi Khumalo I don't have a problem with family members doing business with government or municipalities as long as they apply for work / tenders as everyone else must do and are subject to the same scrutiny as everyone.

This bustaad looks confused It seems as if he does not want to testify @Jabu Malinga He is clueless This isn DUDU's Ben 10😀😁😂 @Ayanda Mqilingwa This is called selective amnesia😀😁😂 How did he remembered to come to the commission today if he can't remember what work her did to get 2million???????????????? why can;t bring people who still remember😀😁😂 Call Zondo to stop ans attend to the problem😀😁😁😂 This commission is captured😎 @Sithembile Dodo 😀😁😂😂😁😀 @Neville Watson 😀😁😂😂😁😀

Gareth Hellyar,Is this Dudu's son? Another dodge company. Kate going to give another one a groot klap!! Is he here by sobpeona? His role in the project was to steal the money. Think Judge has already made his mind up about this one. Think labour laws may have been flouted here as well. Back on track. Bad connection. Think its them. Blocking signal. Going to be a very difficult day for Kate again. How can stupid people like this be allowed to run companies? Did this guy go to school? He can see another Mamela testimony coming up. Eish! "He Not going to pull wool over judge's eyes. Here she comes. Just look at the BS going on in Richards Bay at the mo/ Takes one to notice one @JZ. She is getting aggrivated. Yes. 😀😂 Please block Jacob Zuma guys. A troll. Hope SARS is watching this little lot. Better check bank account. Mafia State!! Hit squad out for Mr. X

Craig Woodward,@anya van loggerenberg I cannot see the Advocate would shed tears if she at all thought it wasn't a credible threat to life... It's not right to speculate that way... It's wrong! Jeepers! This guy has NO memory? This is going to be fun! We could see our first arrest "Now SABC has decided... ""Eish! this guy's gonna lead us all down the garden path...""" "SABC was called by ZUma - ""Shut this guy up""" ENCA coverage better
Mtokozisi Baleni,@Mbuso thus why i think Zuma will never get a fair trial. its either you for or against he doesn't even no his role in the company....i see arrogance. He rehearsed the show "Every witness will come here and waste time  who are you to judge me. just pass your comment @Derrick thus a perfect and true way of disagreeing with others with respect i salute you. @Abel. who are you apologising to? Am proud to be a black person. dont buy a narrative @Fielies thank you. this has nothing to do with race but corruption Hes not a businessman hes company was used to move stolen money @ xolani he doesn't hve a business. he has nothing to lose but SARS @ his door hes hanging himself & his dear mother @Gareth thus exactly what i was thinking with KZN history

They did NOTHING!!!!! Verbal is hard to prove. May have been emails! Crap. This is not about Black excellence. "Consulting covers many Can't recall because there is nothing to recall. He is not lying 😆😆😆😆😆 He can't remember the work he did. Now he won't remember what the expenses were he paid for. Hope I'm wrong Told ya. I bet this guy is not tax compliant. SARS will come knocking. Watch. Michael. Difference between income and legitimate business expenses subject to company tax. Easy to audit. I think that Ms Hofmeyer knows his turnover. This guy is being hung out to dry. Wow. Summarily dismissed. Pressure is building on Dudu. I think she'll crack on split the beans on JGZ. Anne. Watch this space.

Pheladi Lamola,Hello everyone. Who is this Mr Myeni? What does he do? Someone doesn't want us to get to the truth today. What's happening? This guy has been briefed to give vague answers throughout his testimony to avoid outright lying under oath. I think today we have a few bots who were sent to try and discredit this commission. We're learning a lot from this. Some of which we would've had no idea had it not been for this process. I hope SARS is watching But you don't have a record of what work you did. Am I getting this right? "I'm pretty sure his invoice would've quoted the work done Agreed @Walter Theys. What he's saying makes no sense whatsoever. There must be records. It's infuriating @makhosi Got him judge All the more reason to keep records. We don't expect people to remember everything. When it comes to lying Thalente is really talented. @philani cebekhulu I'm a sister🤣🤣. How can I change my photo people? Help!!! But surely Dudu will know who she called about those monies
