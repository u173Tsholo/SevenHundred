You know what it means- give him an Oscar for acting! LIAR @Jenny agreed- it happens in business even in minutes of meetings @Albert Deputy Chief Justice ( Chair) So he knew the profits will be R25k less after the kickbacks The answers are in your head @Munir you on the wrong site Mr Sodi we are connecting the dots. you not an innocent bystander. @Munir no cigarettes here brother. Go play marbles outside @Munir come for Durban poison on special Where was the party Pmb or Gauteng? Well coordinated response 175km "Pmb to Dbn 90km @Low we don't use $ in SA Poor example drink with your son with you Cash = money laundering What vehicle did he use Its a shame he can drink our money away while the gogos don't have water Entertain who? The other comrades must be licking their lips! Its sad @Diana Its called leave no track We've had our fill of lies for today DCJ. let's call it a day SARS and Financial Intelligence Centre need to look at books and bank accounts of TZ Lounge How could TZ afford to carry such a large account? Check credit lines @Quin live in lala land! Property investment with our money! Trusts are ideal vehicles for money laundering its easy to make it look legit. It's a sham This guy is sharp In whose name was the bond and who was paying monthly installments Went well today-lots of evidence was given
TheQueen V,:yougotthis: thanx @Sal will check‚ù§Ô∏è get him putting blame on a dead man is the lowest of low get him pretorous "@english rose please speak for yourself as a taxpayers @English Rose is that the reason you are on this platform right now wasting your data on something you believe is bound to fail? replenish my bar at home üòÄüòÄüòÄ living on oppulance on stolen money. I suppose it's their time to eat the poor victims of apartheid. high flyer cocky thieve people buy food for one whole month worth 4000 or less omw cash means no money trail. tactic of all these blatant thieves

"@ Refiloe Nkabinde So this guy is a multi millionaire coz he scored R100 million in profit üòèüòèüòè Tjerrrrrrrrrrr lol oh Mr Zulu from PMB was together with this guy at a crook place 600k of booze Wow those expensive schools Michael House boma Hillton @Craig Johnson sho boet those rugby boys boet Sodi with em slay queens visiting PMB lol he lives in Zimbali wow when I grow up I want to be a tendapreneur @English Rose lol the guy lives large expensive holy water hmmm scotch I will open an alcohol establishment "Valencia J

Dominic Przybylski,"JT """I have no idea"" is clearly a lie." too many coincidences not similar same Why use only initials in the first place? Payment was made in bags of cash same as Guptas. Earlier he said that he refused to speculate... now he's into speculation big-time. If he was suspicious of his partner then there's no way he would not have looked very closely at the spreadsheet. "He will be arrested if he doesn't wear a facemask in public pay directly to dealership = tax evasion delivers R600 000 worth of booze 100km+!! @Craig Johnson He's a comrade but not employed directly by government. Crate(12 bottles) of expensive booze +-R1000 = 600 trips. If you buy on account have to pay within 30 days. It's normal for a comrade to drink R100 000 per month. Dom Perignon is a lot less than 6000 per bottle. Is there champagne which costs more? Just checked - Dom Perignon 750ml = R2400 Gigaba method of payment. "Usually no more than R200 but I'm WMC So place which can extend R600 000 credit cannot process credit card? Jacob Zuma is an angel Invested same amount in property as he spent on booze in 6 months. Wouldn't have used initials to identify who was paid... So property is in name of payee's trust? Irony What share is in the contract? """whatever share"" indicates he doesn't know what's in the contract." sham contract "Don't have to be a ""legal person"" to see that it is a dicey contract." It's obvious that he had no claim on the property because it was not a joint investment. It was nothing more than a bribe. woo hoo - too many coincidences
Gray Lawrence,"I'll give you two initials blame the dead guy. like they would have record of corrupt payments in his books. you know. you know. "R600
Hein de Wit,Stealer from the poor people...sickening liar Could have...should have...maybe...but... "Does anyone believe this ""speculator""?" So pose the question now... Obscene amounts made on work not even done This Sod is a liar of the most vile kind
Omolemo and Oneetswe,Just tell the truth
thabiso mngadi,this guy is a liar yong he was shot executional style. tz said he delivered alcohol to this guys house.he is lying he must b driving a truck tractor the one used by sab its a pity those who fought for this democracy are struggling and others are dead a lounge which is worth more than a million doesnt have speed point
Andile Pinini,"this enough 
Martin van der Breggen,You are sooooooo over the place now Water - quick 600k is more booze than crazy And then drink and then drive your son and a bootful of booze 100k per month on booze!!!!!! You are not allowed to remove liquor from a licensed premises Memories fade with all the booze He said there were no facilities Lots of hindsight
Anax B,surely there must be some meat to link to these initials.. the evidence leader is wasting time. Indeed üòä
Immanuel,"If he dint know about the initials in the spreadsheet "JT AM? "He purports to have absolute trust in Mpambane in terms of the spreadsheet in question The witness a drunkard? Booze worth R600k wowüçªüç∫üçæüç∑üç∏üçπ So you buy and pay after 2 years or so? What car does he drive that can carry such huge volumes of liquor. Stupid Bought chap wing during alcohol ban lockdown Bought liquor during lockdown when sale of liquor was not permitted?
luciantj,when is this going to end?
Michael Kaudi,"lol you dont play with AM 2 weeks ago alcohol was banned
zip reeper,Sodi is very patient with these fumbling inquisitors
Refiloe Nkabinde,who in SA doesn't know that MEC is not initials LowJack as a signitary? context is important Lowjack to what the question is? his wants to show that he is clever but what he is say will one day change so this guy is saying that he knew about those initials that he said he didn't know conceal and steal are not the same chair how do you sign a check without knowing who you are signing it for did that person wait for you to sign the document without you reading 600k alcohol. it a house meetings at schools is once or twice per term carry cash don't lie if you're going to be asked questions why steal to by alcohol he bought champopo few weeks ago there's card facilities ........ Banks are robbing us legally he said 4000 in wallet when you don't work for the money it's easy to spend. family trusts are Swiss banks for politicians in SA. why are trusts use for transactions? Mr Sodi invest in a trust Whites invest their business in trust. so that they can hire family and not comply with EE but the avert a lot of legislation EE not BEE the value is the only profit.
Sibongile Maputi,Mr Sodi clearly doesn‚Äôt "Two weeks ago he was able to buy alcohol
malcolm payne,slippery slimy par excellance "when he lies his eyes widen and he looks directly at the judge
Gina deW,Mr Phambani's assassination must be investigated - who hired the hitman @Elton Josea He definitely knows something @Brian Shabalala You onto something - before Phambani's assassination their relationship soured @Thabang Lentsoana Yes - by a hitman Somebody is going to roll over on him - truth will prevail - there are those we will apply for immunity section

Sadly he will walk too. No jail for him @EltonJosea let‚Äôs hope JZ will be in an orange jumpsuit. But he might pull a Schabir Shaik & be on death‚Äôs door So the business man is on the losing end on this particular property? Bye all

Lucky Benya,"It's our very own government that exposes us to these thugs "R600 000 spent on alcohol Where did he buy these bottles during lockdown
Philip Fourie,What about the shortfall he paid to you. He were suppose to get R100 mil + but he got R86 mil. The balance they pay the other people. What do you drive a truck. Black market prices
