roberto wilco,Hofmyer is a killer She is so polite as she dismantles people I would say the only people who will be arrested are the whistleblowers Yes Thando she will open up like a surgeon
John Fagan,he looks nervous
Norman Zwane,Jiba & Mwrebi win their concourt application @Jayden Bango @funicanz @Abel Matshidiso Justice Jafta just delivered the judgement. @Born free Our judiciary stands tall by ensuring it is independent from the executive and make its well reasoned decisions. I have no idea what you think CR is - he is the president not the judge too. @Born free Its not my job to educate you but per our constitution t is not for CR to make that decision. Maybe you judst think this is some place were a President is the Lord of all. He is not. "@clive oconnell KPMG "@makhosi nobhatyi I'm informed not by the politics of the country which would support dismissal @Thembisa Odendaal Ag my liefling Ms September sukkel die hele dag lank. I hope she is learning though. Experience cannot be bought and at times it obtained on a big stage which this one is. "@adrian albertyn @Thembisa Odendaal Most of us had to learn the ropes not in the full glare of TV. On my first day as a teacher "@Thembisa Odendaal My colleagues made sure I never forgot that. I did not stay a year. I left for the private sector. Still cannot explain that stubborn erection "@david cele Blade was SG of the communist party that had called for Zuma to step down @Thembisa Odendaal That was so long ago I just remember it as a big joke now and tell the story when I try help a nervous newbie to settle down and focus on what they can do best. Some benefit. @Buyiswa Mnyani Problem my brother is they are the same crowd that run our municipalities and wastefully spend our money. @Thembisa Odendaal I'm old enough now to know better than to think I can last forever or be a gate keeper. It is best to see oneself as a custodian for others Ayeye! Gavin watson asked to come sort out his tax affairs with SARS (This is like getting an enema or bowel flush on boxing day morning). Can this be the beginning of Kiessewtter getting hands dirty BNP was a scam corporate favoured by Dudu Myeni to raise R14.3b SAA wanted. This boy is going to go down in flames quite slowly bcoz he's trying to be smart after the fact. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Most of Gavin's friend were Zuma back side lickers by employment -izinsila zikaZuma @Ongama Dlabantu BNP had no experience.

"@Ongama Dlabantu He dont know the truth himself The rescue I hate the cold fronts from Cape Town "I like that he had CAs and MBAs who did that "@Born free My answer is dont. Let him drown
Modieha Bibi,is this mahlangu was mentioned yesterday on commision? he is in trouble dis guy he ddnt think the time hes start doing wrong answer its simple yes or no el
cassim suleman,yip hofmeyr enjoyable not so easy to arrest..as legal procedures. take 10 years. he is so ill prepared..wat was he doing before he came to comm going to take looong time to arrest zuma npa and hawks havent kicked off yet..battling to find honest prosecutors and cops..needle in haystack judge has to be friendly as this is a commission.people are invited to assist.. hofneyr not so sharp..she left the banks and sbv out of sa express issue..for money laundering so y she leave out bank and sbv. but left banks out no u didnt agree
Takalani Luthada,The aim of the commission is to gather the whole information and does its own recommendations before they take the report to the President to study the report and everything will be decided from there
Born free,Yes he has a very arrogant opinion of himself.. I think he is preparing to set his senior officials up to take the heat off himself. If the killing of white farmers does not stop there will be be no food to feed the masses in this country. Farmers must arm themselves 24 hours of every day.. this is war. Jiba and Mrwebi remain on the Roll of Advocates. What a disgrace.. thanks to Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa dismissed the corrupt two but failed to say they should be removed from the Roll of Advocates. We will have to wait for Judge Zondo to make this finding against Jiba. Haha speed it up They are in breach of the Oath of advocates and should not be allowed to practise privately.. they are a disgrace. This is linked to Crooked Dudu Myneni and her dodgy deal with BnP Capital. SAA planned to pay BnP R265 million in this dodgy deal and Myneni did not follow correct procurement procedures. BNP Capital was unregistered. Mahlangu initially refused to comply with Zondo subpoena and took the matter to court. Eventually his lawyers agreed to withdraw and assist the commission. Myeni and Mahlanga conspired to defraud SAA of R265 million. Mahlanga is Implicated. Myneni and Mahlanga have been exposed in this dodgy deal. "Myeni is a delinquent Director This witness Mahlangu was protecting delinquent Director Myneni and the dodgy deal. Mahlangu is a conartist BnB and Myeni would have succeeded in defrauding SAA of a further R265 million if this scam had not been stopped. The witness did not wilfully come to assist the commission he was subpoenaed and still took the matter to court. @all.. yes it is substantiated.. I must be way ahead of on TV he b SAA had already done all it's Financials pertaining to the Financial Management of the Airline. BnP just added to SAAs financial woes. Thank goodness OUTA put a stop to this dodgy deal. How do you stop a lawyer from Drowning?? Haha@Norman. The answer is.. take your foot off his head. 🤣🤣 Because it is a get rich quick scheme especially when all are involved. State Capture is a BEE get rich quick scheme Yes the witness resisted assisting the commission. BnP entered when they were not registered. I think the ANC ministers and officials think they have an entitlement to steal taxpayers money. Hopefully Zuma will be sleeping on Jail linen after this commission. Jiba is a delinquent Advocate she won't be able to to practice after this commission.

Kevin Simon,loose association. Guy is evasive. Notice the body language. Says yes while shaking his head. Did not want to concede the point. Hofmeyer knows these answers. Wants to just show he is all bluster. Here goes This is looking more and more like chronological inexactitudes of others' experience. NPA even arresting their own now This is going to be about another hijacked BBEEE company. So we have not yet established their (his) experience prior to the SAA funding deal. Not necessarily and I didn't is not the same thing. This oke just saw dollar signs..
Danie Nilsen,goeiemore dumelang goodmorning heyta and how are we this morning hope well i tuned in a bit late and did i miss anything what is this about mlugisi it sounds like race comment if it is i d not think it is on topic please advise 1st week july why is this state capture so surprizing to some people this is how africa functions it is actualy busness as usual even the police chief looks like a mafie boss @at least 1 agreeing with me and it includes the goverment and private sector off all of the country there are no angels here al the wings are of the same thing corruption yes please he is verbaly diahrea now he talks a lot ans say nothing this will not work the judge and advocate is sharp mis september is a top advocate her strat is to come across as soft but are just leading the witness into mistakes as thinking she is easy she is not. the judge is a bit harsh on her minister of the taxi association and the burning of busses and trains he always says we and i lol not i indeed gavin is in london as we speak or write rerig? on the justice side they work for a sallary on the looters side they just steal

watson mutanga,The witness comes across as being passively aggressive.
Some guy,hi Everyone. when is Zuma appearing here? so we can finish this commission and arrest him "okay cant wait. this commission needs to end and he must go to prison. Its taking too long well someone has to be arrested. and its pointing to him lol i just want action. weve heard enough stories now "if we dont arrest then in the end he will say he was prejudiced and therefore the case is unfair they are all crooks even this judge. i dont trust him anymore same thing will happen here. theyl come up with some terrible excuse. wasting our time
