zacharia mhuruyengwe,Secrecy Act..The former Head of Intelligence will never spill the beans!
Joseph Akwa,No surprises here - you remember the taped conversation btwn him and the former Public Protector - which he had always denied did not happen? Well take your pick.
fefe Mtshokotsha,@Siseko Davani but we must also be careful because all other South Africa n presidents were darlings.Why not any attack on them? some people act as if spies/enemies were never there or given post before Zuma became president.I wonder National Party members who end up being part of Anc.Under how's watch did that happen? if I'm late from now on I will blame it on Sabc "Papa Zondo's voice 🤔 @Siyabonga Magwaza👏👏👏👏 Tambo in 1990/1991 warned Anc about Pravin and others who were spies within the Anc "funny how Da were friends with the Gupta's but no @Musa Bakiti👏👏 let's play with De Klerk.I have been waiting law baba
Lorna Kavanagh,I feel that Zuma is making a mockery of the Commission. Zondo is treating this man different. Zondo you don't need to fall over yourself to please Zuma.
Derek Main,@Naledi Celma Are you saying it's totally irrelevant that the man is a crook? Don't you just love it when the comrats are taking chunks out of each other. "Judge Zondo has seen all this ducking "@fefe jez Given that the ANC is so corrupt @Talent P Sibisi I don't believe Zuma as far as I could spit at him. He's proven time and again that he is a consummate liar. "@Sindiswa Moolman Let's hope we don't have another ""Arms Deal"" whitewash." @sfiso mtolo Let these things come out. We love it when the comrats fight each other. @Musa Bakiti Anyone who stands for what is right and the rule of law want Zuma to be punished for his crimes. @Sizwe Zuma When was that? @Wesley Myburgh Correct the ANC is corrupt to the core. We just dealing with Zuma first. @Collen Lediga Corrwct. The ANC is on trial. @lungile Mllanga Yes - they are all complicit in the wasted years. We'll get to them after Zuma. It's becoming clear that the biggest hindrance to SA improving is the ANC's factional battles
abel kasi,ZUMA WE ARE WITH YOU ALL THE WAY. time to get my pop corns i had zondo is in the toilet please move on mr pretorious
Bahia Davids,Fear your Lord Zuma I am I salute that man Pretorius must rip him to pieces zuma is a liar . Zondo you letting SA down Rule 3.2 Assessing the truthfulness of the witness.

We can comprehend He says lots of nothing simply said Pretorius...in few words He has no understanding. His fingers are too long qualifications matters bottomless glass well said Pretorius not deserving....like zuma Zuma is avoiding justification He must add It's important to the nation don't worry apartheid era will be blamed for his stupidity what Bronx wavy...true...deregister Ai tog....Zuma don't know loyalty qualifications is key We not winning not moving fwd either He can't read man...He pages nervously where is Angel Gabriel😱😱come get him👹uber if u must and the ministers employed by the Guptas.... where was the committee then He is mad at Barbara Hogan He don't remember why does he get an option to remember or not this is poor look at the lawyers attitude Mr skakani ....

Sifiso Mavuso,lets start
Magda Seguin,Yesterday a law professor said that Zuma was asked 15 times to appear at the commission.His lawyers are just wanting to discredit tge commission "You will not get off so lightly Semantics "Zondo is soft on Zuma This is ridiculous funny how Zondo treated Mr Pienaar vis a vis Zumas legal team...its obvious he is not impartial The country is already dysfuntional @Thando Nkutha I did that the whole day yesterday @funicanz remember van Rooyen being made finance minister ...he was a backbencher and he only lasted a weekend He wants to implicate CR....how devious Zuma will end up like his pal el Bashir who is going the International Criminal Court Zuma must tell Ralphs family why hevkept him solitary confinement in Lusaka until he was emaciated and died 5 days after he was relased His colleagues he accused of bring spies says Zuma should never have become head of intelligence as he was alway paranoid "The country is at a standstill due to the ANC factional politics Thief Its not about ANC deployment its about Barbara Hogans testimony... The Guptas chose not you Zuma Tsepang I mentioned that so many times since Monday...Zondo is not impartial @ Gerald Beukes speak for yourself. He does not even refer to what is best for the country He adnitted that there are factions...Pretorious norvXondo mentioned the word faction Zuma should ask his chinese friends for Tiger Balm...there is definitely something wring with his throat RESPECT IS EARNED...Zuma and the ANC looted the country into oblivion Gigaba who gave the Guptas SA nationality was made Minister of Finance without quakifications or experience "@Ms Carol Barbara Hogan Deployment Committee = Gupta brothers at the Saxonwold shebeen SA dont have a 5th amendment...read the Constition and educate yourself His sangoma said he must drink lots of water Hahaha Hhlaudi....he and Faith Muthambi destroyed the SABC Constitutional Court Judge And he recalled Gordhan from London on a fake story I must have blocked about 60 since yesterday "Zuma is lying...other countries dont deploy people because they have the struggle credentials Gama was Zumas choice...it opened the door to the looting at Transnet Transnet is sueing Gama for R166m Gama is involved in the Transnet Gupta Regiments theft Gama was made CEO by Zuma to help the Guptas steal through Regiments Capital Anoj Singh was involved in the looting for the Guptas in all SOEs...he should be arrested Everybody lied according to Zuma Only choice because he was a Gupta lackey to steal through Trillian and Regiments Capital...Gupta iwned companies The Guptaleaks emails has all the evidence Does Zuma know what cognitive means? Gama is being sued by Transnet for R166m...he worked for Zuma and the Guptas to steal money for Trilluan and Regiments Capital owned by the Guptas Now Zuma says yes he knew the Transnet board said Gama was not CEO material. Zuma made Gama CEO after he got rid of Maseko.Brian Molefe is also involced in the mess at Transnet The China Rail deal money was never recuperated.The Guptas formed a fake shelf company in Hong Kong and laundered the money there.The locomotive moneyvran into billions of rands South Africans who support Zuma and the ANC dont inform themselves about the magnitude of taxpsyers monry stolen Zuma already implicated himself heavily today @saywhat the spine of the file is the back when you fold it ...usually the title or number is on there when you close the file @kagiso mathole read the Guptaleaks emails...there is a ton of proof
Mariki Erasmus,Let the lying continues....this man is competition for the devil himself Did no one wanted to kill him thistime? "Back and forth is fine He actually says nothing sensible Again passing blame.... Now hepulls in rama Hehehehm Mr 4 days minister... #zumamustfall "How onearth can everyone be wrong you moron Yes Devan.... Funny how never coughs when he speaks when there is no controversial point Gera Gerald😂🤣 Zondo heard exactly correct... he did say that I don’t know Ben barnard.....i also want to know....i think this moron was behind chris hani murder "Makwa "Today he is not sure....cannot remember...of course De klerk will not answer I don’t know to all questions. "How could i have said this? Because youdid "It could not This liar.... Zuma beats the devil on lying!! Zuma didnot follow the process that was supposed to be Kids Kollie...I tend to agree with you "Put your foot down zondo "There is a lot of things youshould not have done idiot

Sylvester Finger,Zuma remembers all what they did to him for 29years but not what he did😏😏😏 thanks Deputy Chief Justice. @Sofia Sofia hi Zondo is somehow siding with Zuma's legal team @goolamv we should write a complaint to the commission for this. it's unfair @goolamv yes. It's like he's giving him respect @goolamv yes. we should write to the commission Zuma is struggling to read red ink😂😂😂 Jacob means a thief and Gedkehkejisa Gedlehlekisa means the one who'd kill you with a smile. Name's speak volume the ANC is a shame and worthless. What are they saying after what this guy's first day testimony? Zuma 🐸 cadre deployment killed our beautiful country "those saying that Zuma's clever because he headed the Intelligence of the ANC are clueless. Being a Chief of Intelligence the ANC processes are exposed here. They allowed Zuma and his friends to get unfair advantage over the rest of us @Werner Janse Van Rensburg nee moenie mahn!!!😂😂😂 Zuma's exposing himself 😂😏 my understanding is that the ANC captured the country not Zuma 🐸 @Sifiso Dlamini they do and they protect each other @sifiso Dlamini they have been going there. They kissed Zuma for implementing the policies of the conference Zuma's feeling the 🔥🔥🔥 @Sifiso Dlamini you're wright sir DCJ is getting annoyed by Skhakhane at last he remembers something Zuma needs to eat a lot of n Zuma needs to eat a lot of bananas to regain thoughts. He has to remember "reports differ. as a leader he knows that. so 😀😀😂😂😂 page and paragraph are far different 🙄🤔
Amanda Bentsile,Zuma wont even remember he was on this commision @Sylvester Finger My point exactly he remembered 1990 stuff but 2009 things @Sofia Sofia Threats and more amnesia Zuma's supporters are so delusional they still refer to him as President Admin the volume is too soft Guys what are you counting Zuma laughs then says i dont know ..thats a sign he lying why you always lyying ..singing Funny thing is Zuma remembers that he was once a president Zuma is not listening

Mr Zondo has to really be fair as much as we want things to go differently he has to be the bridge between the fire ... We are never going to get any info from Zuma he came here to the commission as a HOAX ... Before he starts they should have placed a JOJO tank some acid reflux tabs and a grade 7 teacher to assist with numbers ..... @Edwin Arthur lol @Magda Seguin there was no threats.... @clive oconnell since he can't count I bet he thinks he has 1 child Assassins have failed us !

mothusi alfred,GREETINGS!!
Lwazi Mbutho,People out here claiming Zuma is stupid but they stupid behinds out here hoping he will incriminate himself. You cant be caught out about not remembering stuff. He doesn't remember if you have hidden evidence then it will jog his memory rather than proofing that he lied under oath "Why did the commission call Zuma before they had any actual evidence @Mohau Lekhoaba true but do expect him to give them the evidence they need to prosecute him? certainly not "I think Miss Hogan missed a key thing in her observation "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux

Steve Van Niekerk,Zuma is a disgrace of a human being. Symbolises all that is bad in this country. Thando Khumalo says a person supporting the biggest corrupt crook acting as a leader for an incompetent criminal governing party. Thando and perfected by you people who are tryingto steal the whole country from right under all of us. Dishonesty is the hallmark of the corrupt and incompetent ANC leadership. Did the Guptas steal Zuma's brain as well. Zuma gives black people a bad name. Zupa ZUPTA ZUPTA CROOK ZUPTA ZUPTA ZUPTA ZUPTA Put truth serum in his water General practise in the world.....the communist world yes. CROOK POEPHOL BABA ZUMA PAPVRETER Het jy al ooit so n pateet vir n leier gesien.gEEN WONDER DIE LAND IS MOER TOE NIE. Papvreter hou hom nou slim. Hy prpbeer hard maar die lift gaan nie tot bo toe nie. My staffie kan beter antwoord as ou Zupta Ha...ha....dalk begin ewe skielik die waarheid praat. Send in the cops and arrest him now. Watch the rand reach its best price ever against all major currencies. Aartheid seems to have been the answer after all. I refuse to regard this type of misfit as my leader. Intelligence😂😂😂😂😂😂 head Zuma just nailed. Watch him wobble ....pathetic lying excuse for a leader. "This Gupta stooge has ruined the careers of hundreds of honest hard working people.Disgraceful rubbish Zuma makes the old apartheid crooks look like angels. Child playing President protected by his party and his well paid lawyers. This crook should be put in front of a firing squad. Arrest this crook Kid president. He has already told two million and thousand and forty and six lies ...listen carefully. Zuma's lawyers are making him look more guilty. "If you want the truth  Can Zuma actually read ? President that can not read ???????? Wish I had a boss as clueless as old Zuma. Imagine being Zuma's teacher at school ? That why he only has grade 2.? Bring back the colonialists. Are there still people that believe this crook ? The red one......okaay......number red ....looking....looking... Which one...the red one.....no I do not remember. Lawyer ...please jump in .....this is killing me. Daai kriek suffer nou lelik. Ja the bullet....an AK47 bullrt. Sy kop blink darem mooi....al wat bright is. Kyk hoe blink sy kop as hy lieg. Please tell me this is not broadcast overseas.... Eish....it is getting warm at this commision..what..what "No wonder the Guptas  Zuma ....can I please phone a Gupta. Bring him his machine gun. RET ....where did all the money go ....the Guptas.
jasper dougal,Zondo is unbelievable ! How much more can he keep on trying to placate Zumba’s Hoods ! Why do they keep asking a question to Zuma and then keep putting it to him endless different ways in order for that buffoon to answer it ? Really makes you wonder just exactly what the President was there for as he seems to be involved with NOTHING. He has yet to admit to his involvement with anything How then did Mimister Des Van Royaan become appointed to the finance department when he had no experience in that role ? Just astonishing what comes out of Zumba’s mouth "Who knew that when you have to answer to a Commission about Witness statements  "I can’t believe Zondo

Dominic Przybylski,How to get on the gravy train so that elite get their share of the gravy. How did Des Van Rooyen get deployed? @Victor Zungu We are angry because money meant for the poor was given to rich ANC cadres and Guptas. I think Zondo is trying to make JZ feel comfortable so that he starts to get his memory back. People who they know i.e. People who will help to take money mean't for the poor to help the other people they know to get on the gravy train. Intelligence (i.e. spying) is not same as IQ. "ANC has proved to be interested in enriching it's own members Even people with criminal convictions are deployed. Why is that? @zweli Mbatha I think at least half the people making comments here are not South Africans. It was proved by the majority of people who support EFF are not South African in last elections. "Can he be asked why he fired Barbara Hogan Did deployment committee have anything to do with appointment of Van Rooyen or was it the Saxonwold shebeen deployment committee? So how did Guptas get to choose ministers? This man is refusing to answer any question directly. He said in parliament that the ANC comes before the country. One of them is guilty of perjury. Ask him if Hogan is lying This man is climbing down into a hole being dug for him. He clears his throat every time he lies. JZ is starting to squirm """Normally"" is being used to avoid answering specifics." """I don't know [if I have any knowledge]""" """I think I was looking at the process..."" The man has serious case of amnesia." He is responding in same way as a guilty gangster. "In future our presidents should be checked for whether they have the ""cognitive development"" required for the job." He puts nothing in writing so that there's no evidence... is what he taught Dudu Myeni. """I think so"" = yes?" Sad state of the nation.

letsclean kuruman,I like it when they provoke Zuma to the last degree maybe we may find out what happend to Chris Hani. I so love this guy. that's the only president in south africa who knows politics. @Matu. only a politician can do that. Zuma was a real tiger. @Sthe.I agree with you. @Dominic. Please go back to Zuma's opening remarks. you will realize that all this was done. Zuma was plotted. media was part of that. remember media can make you and destroy you again. lool. Ramaphosa said to Zondo. Please help him Or I am DEAD. keep on provoking him to the last degree. @Goitsimodimo. it's a fact. look Zuma knows everything about ANC. in fact that's the only person acting politics not money. first do you know how did Ramaphosa become rich? don't play with Ubaba . @Devan.that's a concept injected the minds of our people. Media played a big role to destroy Zuma. because he was opening our eyes. corruption was there before Zuma. Since 1994 til now 700billion gone Zuma did steal YES. But how much? Anyone with proof? But there is a proof of how ramaphosa made is money. looool.Zuma was dealing with Cash. thats a mafia style. New Age newspaper and ANN7 was wise @Devan. Do you think Mbeki didn't steal? Billion of rands were not stolen while he was president ? They did. But as for Zuma it's not about money. this is personal. if anyone can proof. I will suppt @Devan. Who introduced Guptas to Zuma? All this was influenced to remove Zuma because he was not a begger to white monopoly. He showed bravery to fight that. Media companies are owned by spies in SA "@Devan. My point is don't you think that If Guptas did steal with Zuma as people say @Devan. Guptas account wers froozen. NOT ZUMA. So does that makes him corrupt? @Devan. Is it wrong to know business people as president? Remember this is a democratic country. Ramaphosa can share a table with Motsepe. Does that makes him corrupt. because he owns mines? DMR ther

Mase Betha,this would never happen in zimbabwe is he going jail or naw
Duncan Deuchars,"Questions posed
Born free,That would be Zuma himself no wonder the SOEs have no money. Zuma has just implicated himself.. wonderful the commission has less to prove. I have more respect for my dog Zuma must prove his innocence SOE Board Posts Not Only About ANC Loyalty... But About Self Enrichment. Zondo has a very deep voice but he is an intelligent man.. unlike Zuma who must go to jail. Zumas body guards cost the taxpayer R2. 6 Billion a year. Zuma costs too much much money to protect and must go. I thought that the deputy President has little to do with appointments of ministers and it is the President who should be involved.. infact I read this in an article. There is no white monopoly.. just black majority Zuma has blood on his hands I wonder what Zuma will do for you Mr Beakus??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Loyalty Over Country yes the communist were the ANC SACP Why do you think the Communists backed the Terrorists?? They intend to gain from it in more ways than one. If you are a civil servant get your pension out now or transfer it to a Private Scheme. Zumas process only The Land was bought and paid for not stolen. Zuma should have been recorded at all times.. where are you the minutes of these meetings?? Where are you the minutes of the boards meetings?? He never looks comfortable when questioned but he looks very comfortable singing and chanting to his ignorant small group of supporters. Zuma became President because he was assisted by Malema. I want to see the list of names that Zuma says are conspiring against him The witness is Poor and not truthful to this commission. Sit down now. Zuma is an oversexed Polygamist He will be in the soil before he knows it 🤣 More like 80% Zuma is the culprit wasting time. He is an oxygen theif Africa was better off under colonialism.. that's a fact 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😨😨💦💦💦💦💨💨 The point is to establish whether Zuma had an influence on the choice of Ministers.. which he did. Not too old for his 14 wives especially the youngest Zuma is an oversexed Polygamist with no brains His brain is in his Jean pants Can't wait to get to the Bosasa matter Zuma and his legal team have had plenty of time to watch on YouTube the witnesses testimonies Forrest Gump is brighter than Zuma I would rather Pretorius gets richer and Zuma pay more costs for his lawyers. You must come back from Europe so that I can have a place in my ancestral country. The land was paid for not stolen. Africans had free tribal land as they lived in tribal communities this was their culture. Stop populating it will solve the poverty issue The truth and not to be racist.. is that Africans cannot govern and have a successful country.

enidorehs,So positions wasnt filled by qualified people but members of the Anc chosen by the Anc. Mr President what was your purpose of the Anc did your job not even for the citizens of this country 🤷🏻‍♀️🤔 @Tsepang Ranneileng. I feel the same way🤔🤷🏻‍♀️ @Kung Fu Kenny. You are wiser than luvuyo who seems to be looking for attention. Dont let him rope you in. We not here for outside politics✊🏾 Why is Zuma talking about the ANC when he must answer as the former president. How did he miss the memo that he was the president It is just sad to know a teenager has more sense than this person who once led our country😱
Refiloe Nkabinde,if dp chairs logically President appoint if its decided in the NEC so he makes the final decision as a President of NEC so he knew the person who was to be appointed. so why is he not say yes that who I wanted appoint. dada this is not boxing dada Eff e khona we won't we are not in other countries so you were implementing what other African countries are doing "trained "" expressing her own views""" your problem here. he is calling his lawyers now. he is confused he only talks processes I don't know ngobela stop it this is a chat room not walk of fame wall no but why does he not expect him to know 👏👏 something remember ed so report are that insignificant cognitive development wow what development would you suggest to be put into place for that. that was a subjective assessment. go raa gore he cannot operate at that level so he wanted the guy or doesn't want to look incompetent so many memoranda. if you knew you were going to be asked about what Barbara Hoggen said in connection with appointment of CEO. he should have asked for documents relating to that

Starsky Hudge,"""The desirable thing in a man is his loyal love
Jacob Motlhale,I personally know about Anglo america and Lonmin under-declaring yields and carrying gold and platinum oversees in executive helicopters. South Africa is not rich or wealthy in african stds. Zuma and the Guptas looted the coffers. This is said but no one tells us how much money he took and into which of his bank accounts the loot that collapsed our country is. This is strange. Does anyone know how much money zuma stole? If coffers were looted should subtraction not tell us how much he stole? How much money did zuma steal? if its not on his bank statement he should be charged with money laundering because we know he looted the coffers right? "Racists DID YOU KNOW - DO YOU KNOW "DO YOU KNOW South Africa's most expensive export by mass:price ratio is Assassination services. The CIA love our contractors for Eu black ops.

The whole ANC is socialist. @letsclean kuruman how was he opening our eyes? He's the one that made the 700 billion go POOF. He never mentioned corruption or any fraud within government but he is NR1. "@letsclean kuruman In JHB alone @Mxolisi Thango Viva tsotsi. He stole money from the poor and allowed Indians to loot us. Explain how WMC exists when the Gov gets 45% taxes on them???? @Mxolisi Thango WMC was a term created by people in Europe to cause racial tension in SA. You are falling for propaganda. Even the ANC themselves said WMC doesnt exist. You are just racist. @Musa Bakiti Land doesnt created nearly as much wealth as education does. The industrial revolution led us to be able to create billions from one computer. @Gerrie Thomas Well with this ancient land mentality there is no hope. I hope Zuma goes to Polsmoor @Xolelo Mboniswa You clearly dont understand how law works. The Constitution inst reteroactive/ @Xolelo Mboniswa However Zuma did commit these crimes in a democracy @letsclean kuruman the Guptas is all proof we need. They had propaganda ANN7 and they stole money. Zuma was best friends with them. @Nonto Ngubane and no money spent in basic education. Kids dying in pit toilets @Mxolisi Thango still explain to me how can whites rule the economy when people pay 45% taxes???? There are more black millionaires than whites and black middle class is far bigger?? @Nonto Ngubane okay there you lost me. @Xolelo Mboniswa yes persecuting someone because he stole government xD @Nonto Ngubane yes the oppenheimers pay half of all their money to the ANC. So come again?? @letsclean kuruman oh tell me then why was all their assets in SA frozen? @letsclean kuruman why did they flee the country??? @Nonto Ngubane okay now youre just a silly troll @Nonto Ngubane i answered you seriously and you are just trolling. @Nonto Ngubane coming with this oppenheimer conspiracy when they pay 45% taxes to the gov? How is that WMC?? "@Nonto Ngubane We are poor as a country because eskom owes 700 Billion @Nonto Ngubane no you cant even think for yourself you rely on conspiracies and you dont have an ounce of logic if you think people who pay 45% taxes are to blame @Nonto Ngubane its okay SA will keep suffering because people like you believe these thieves @letsclean kuruman how else did they get into the government? Zuma is related to the Guptas and a lot of other things. Take all into account @Nonto Ngubane They pay 45% taxes. @Kholi Ngcakani 700 billion total sorry "@Nonto Ngubane if your black leaders didnt loot 700 billion out of eskom @Nonto Ngubane but no you blame whites. Not very smart neh "Country getting worse by the year @Kids Collie Learn some basic law principles. We weren't a democracy then and we had no constitution. Zuma committed these crimes under a democracy. @Shingirayi Nyamukubva will zuma answer to all the black children dying daily because Zuma screwed up the economy? @Shingirayi Nyamukubva more people die yearly in SA due to murder alone than died during the whole apartheid. @Kholi Ngcakani lol you cant answer so you go to censorship XD Lol saying I cant remember to everything makes you seem very guilty xD Him not answering anything will go against him in court dont worry. @Phyllis Kumalo go study some law "@Talent P Sibisi ya education @Musa Bakiti everyone except he is lying. @SCELO GUMEDE and all the other people? Everyone lying except Zuma? Thats a conspiracy.. @Talent P Sibisi no you didnt? "Most white people dont even have land "@Musa Bakiti Go find it in the Congo @Shingirayi Nyamukubva and you sound like a conspiracy theorist @Musa Bakiti and you sound like a slave to the black leaders😂 @Talent P Sibisi sorry where did I say that? @SCELO GUMEDE WMC doesnt exist. The anc even said it doesnt exist. WMC was a term create by people in Europe to create racial division and you are falling for it 😂 @SCELO GUMEDE no it was the Zuma Anc boy. @letsclean kuruman the best thief you are right!
