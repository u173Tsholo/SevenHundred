Siyabonga Dzingwa,Morning to you all South Africa has been captured We need decisive leadership with balls. This wishy-washy nonsense is not taking us anywhere. Gordan has learnt the State's weaknesses and he is capitalising on it. He can't be put to jail until proven guilty in front of the Court.
Thulani Bukani,hes lying An actual minister interested in combating corruption is too busy to make it to the inquiry.
Taylor Duvernay,who pulled a no show?

Melvict Melbourne,...with that been said RET stooges are out in full force. Why is the saint not there? he is trying to find the stolen money for SAA To be honest...I don't trust Gordhan' anyway Time that DCJ grow a pair and act like someone that is running the show. NPA is a lame duck People voted for the NP because they knew this would happen. but they are dumb Just like the masses from rural kzn that is very true and what did they say I saw a photo of an old woman next to a shack wearing a oversize ANC T-shirt and I didn't feel any sympathy. She got what she voted for Why do people wear political party clothing? it is not a sports team.
Andrew Mboweni,"i think it is very wrong for ace magashule s sons and cyril ramaphosa s andile ramaphosa to involve themselves in tenderprenuers with the state  lord pravin gordhan @makhosi nobhatyi i am referring to the bosasa contract it should had not happened andile ramaphosa must desist from such activities with the state wether it is a fair tender he is the son
Keith Odwa,Gordhan is above the law @Bev Daniels that is rubbish he is scared of CE Gordhan doesnt respect this commission but eventually he will cross examined and exposed as the liar he is
pierrewhk,die 2 brein selle hebruik dit... 2 brein selle gebruik. eee eee eee eeee eee e√®
Bev Daniels,"@Keith Odwa No GORDHAN is not above the law
Tutu Mkhize,what happened to judge Makhubela? she was refused her application of postponment so the same principles must be applied unless Godhan is untouchable. mxm. I wish it can start with Zondo

Akhona Gala,I hope we won't take another 20min for file arrangements and numbering
Andre Van Zyl,Gordon should be summoned as a lesson to all others with non valid excuses
DUMI ZuLU,Waste of tax payers money.
Melor Hadebe,This is unfair DCJ !!!!!! ..... Judge Makhubela was issued a directive when she didnt appear now cross examination for min Gordon is postoned just like that no its unfair i repeat its unfair DCJ

FieliesSA,Its sad but the 3% ANC vote base that watch this due to access will not make a difference to the 97% that blindly votes for them for a free T shirt and 1 meal Its up to ex- ANC supporters to reach out to those people and make them aware what their government is doing. "@1 Million Views They rely on people like you to keep them in power. Wake up. They have been ""self correcting"" for more than a decade now" @makhosi nobhatyi Amen
Ashleigh Robertson,ANC is over Such a shame as the ANC was not meant to tarnish SA but to improve it. South Africa has the potential to be the best country in the world. Just needs new leaders. It‚Äôs a fact. We are the cradle of mankind

Tshepo Hlatshwayo,Are we going to have prosecution or wasting of Tax payers money? And why are we still voting anc to power if these are a waste of time?

Eugene,WHAAZZAAP!! This is pointless. ANC will stay above the law. I agree with the other people. this is just a waste of time. I never voted once in my life. so you should ask yourself that question. lol you touched someone's feelings i feel the same Thami will keep on voting for corrupt ANC because of Apartheid ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So the best thing to do to get over Apartheid is to suffer under the ANC? or keep voting for the ANC because you too have your hands on the cookie jar Thami doesn't want improvements she likes things just the way it is. Zimbabwe has experienced. South Africa still needs to learn the hard way They voted wrong because of the brainwash methods of Marxism I saw a arm less black guy wearing a DA t-shirt he told me he used to vote for the ANC before his arms were cut off I didn't ask any questions after that. Guess his legs will be next "You can support this arm less guy if you want to. You will find him on a street corner in Albertskroon This hole thing is about trillions of rands that went missing. And guess what...... That money will never be returned. Refaat are you from South Africa? this is a courtroom in South Africa BEE is also legalise theft. Supporting BEE is like supporting Ramaphosa with his billions while other people starve. Ramaphosa has made billions by creating laws that people should hand over their com I'm going to go now and stop wasting my time here. Because I know at the end of the day nothing will be solved.
Johnny Kolders,sabc..synchronize PLEASE
Carmen Mackay,Now they are using delay tactics for the elections so they can win over their pple just be F.....over with the next Nation desaster...
dada ngova,this is all over the world politics has turned out to be power not servicing the nation
Makhosini Floyd zwane,We need to develop an no racial no apartheid party in the country. all these parties are doing is to continuously misuse state resources to benefit themselves. The majority party needs to be treated as they treat us. All commission are setup to divert the current status on the actual issues faced by the country. This is a military strategy "Currently the country focus is on the commission outcome
Selvan Thambiran,every person has a right to vote for a party. Our purpose to vote is not just to put a particular party or individual into power but rather to elect to have our lives and surrounds improved. If you feel a specific party or individual is not to your benefit then you may vote for another party. Voting for the same party again will not give a different outcome based on their track record Zimbabweans voted as die hards for Zanupf like it was a soccer team and sadly most of the population is now in South Africa. I asked some of them why did you not vote for another party this commission is doing outstanding work but we still await Zuma to testify
Joseph Kiptibai,The Judge is veery sober
Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,What people do not realize is that there is much better life than what the ANC offer. People voted for the NP for the very same reasons people now vote for the ANC - there is no strong opposition Zimbabweans are an example of educated people still making uneducated decisions.

Gerda 7,"Sanjay Maybe all the money is in Cuba!!Remember Zuma loves that country!!! "They are concerned about alcohol and cigarettes They dont think trough issues! I do not have a job and also applied for R350.I did not qualified....maybe its because I am white?? "I want to cry This is a mafia state. Cyril Ndaba üëç The USA government give every household 400 US dollars a month.EVERY household!Why dont they do it here in SA ?They give money for people to get children and this is not sustainable!
kevindbn007,Yoh hes still on @ Sammy.... only time will tell we need a new party in govt lol according to my affidavit make sure you say the same thing mineer @ Aurthur... or nuke the present....lol sa politics needs a reset button corruption will ALWAYS be part of government.... nature of the beast ie: Politics the scale in this country is just ridiculous there was corruption in the apartheid area.... there is mass corruption in the current era looks that way Elma.... 2yrs this commission is goin gon the process of accountability is just too long "swift "SAPS "sorry Elma
Refaat Yaacoub Agha,what even is this and why is it in my recommended hahaha australia hahaha oh ok well goodluck
Dominic Przybylski,This is so tedious. Enough now. There is enough evidence to prove that unethical people will be corrupt if given an opportunity. We don't need years worth of testimony to enlighten us. We now need to find a way to prevent corruption and how are we going to do that when there is no law enforcement? BEE has cause huge corruption. EWC is going to put the nails into the economy's coffin. EWC is simply legalised theft. I think we've forgotten what the purpose of this commission is. It's become a bloated waste of time. All Zondo can do in the end is make recommendations which the ruling party can ignore. "@skilash Skilash NPA has evaporated. We should be hearing testimony in specific court prosecutions which lead to convictions This commission is a dog which does not even bark let alone bite. It has no teeth. Same as our president. "Only time people get thrown into jail is when they sell somebody a cigarette No prosecutions for theft. "We have a government which calls theft ""redistribution of wealth"" or ""expropriation without compensation"" or ""radical economic transformation"" so it cannot be treated as a crime." We are in a country of two systems: Capitalist system and Communist system - the host and parasite respectively. Unfortunately the parasite is now bigger than the host and will be the demise of both. The R70 billion borrowed from IMF at 1%. Rand has already lost 2% against Dollar since then so already we will have to repay 3% i.e. three times more. We cannot carry on stealing what we are borrowing. It's not the government which will have to repay. It's the people who will have to pay. In normal democracy the people(voters) would not allow criminals to rule them. If they are allowed to rule then the people who allowed it will have to live with the consequences. "Will be better to cancel this commission Everything stinks. "Rice and pap are cheaper than bread @ronald wiley it brings tears to eyes.
Zamile Hina,"whats wrong now 
Thulani Mpanza,I made submissions to that commission online from June 2018 onwards until I physically came there on 21 February 2019 but thereafter I realized that the Commission itself is captured. I was automatically unfairly dismissed by the KZN ANC and KZNDOE on 13 June 2016 for being a Shembe discipline.
Melusi Sikakane,@Thulani Mpanza I call it#zondononsense It is unfortunate that even judges have allowed themselves to be used by anc factions. This guy who is cross examining is also involved in the prasa saga

Who used my money If I had known that I will be refused my money I would have paid that money into a bank account every month so that I would be able to use it when I needed it "Don't you find it so funny that now they can assist with R350 for the un-employed

Riaan DW,The ANC will always be more important than the people. "DoDo DoDo Sad but true.

CYRIL NDABA,Which other African country has ever accessed an IMF loan? Seemingly we are the only one. I am subject to correction on this. I see us going back to the IMF in the not-too-distant future! Expect the Government to announce a slight increase of R1OO to social grants just before the local government elections in 2021. @ronald. Food parcels and R350 grant for 6 months will secure votes for the govt. @Gerda7. It is because that R350 has gone into the pockets of some officials. R350 PER MONTH is too little. Cant even buy you a loaf of bread a day Because that is what R350 a month can buy. Even potatoes are a luxury R250 a month translates to a little over R11.50 A DAY What else can you buy for R11.50 a day. What can else can you buy. A kilo of meat cost around R110.
