Anne M.,@SABC Digital News Isn't the afternoon session scheduled to start at 14h30? @SABC Digital News Thank you 😃 "Hmmm Yes This is like pulling teeth without anaesthetic. And instructed by somebody more senior than him "@brenda maluka Yes @Pastor J Yes. Thankfully the DCJ is a very intelligent man. @Petrus Mahlangu Stealing from the poor - the Guptas had/have no conscience 😀 @Yolo More I think he was in his late 50s when he retired @Raymond Raymond He was also arrested by Hawks along with 6 Gupta cronies. "@Bonang Sithole He was arrested by the Hawks last year with 6 others and was given R10 One of the Vrede Farm whistle blowers was murdered in October last year. @Mzalwane Mzala Was the Hawks arrest done on instruction of the PP or independantly?
Thulani Bukani,and then? why is she apologising? how can the questions be prejudice when he's been charged? he must go to jail
Pastor J.J,Well said Madam Is he trying to do a JZ trick here? "Mr Thabete""s behaviour has become very familiar of a witness we had 2 weeks ago that created a drought in Parktown" Yes Anne JZ did the same "@Dominic Przybylski Al @Anne M. It seems that they are all singing from the same hymn sheet yes u are right @Anne M. GO STRAIGHT TO JAIL. DO NOT PASS BEGIN. DO NOT COLLECT R200. Did I say it right? @Raven Penny U are very right. And the Guptas just spent another R400million on another wedding. By the time the NPA starts to get active we will be lucky to even get R4.00 back Not even R4.00 ? hahahaha hi @Yolo More Who cares. Just happy to be rid of this skelm @Lorraine Naidoo Can u imagine what an indian would do with a R30M wedding? @Lorraine Naidoo Noooooo. My wedding cost me R725.00 .41 379.31 weddings for me.hahahahaha @Lorraine Naidoo . I believe you. @Lorraine Naidoo That is so sad. When I started working I was paid R125 for 6 days of work. It was really hard but also very painful when we were exploited. @Dominic Przybylski U are absolutely right. My late dad went thru the same @Smart Guys Oh yes Agrizzi "@barbara broadbent Why books? I like books. But I have a few spare hammers "@Lorraine Naidoo Maybe we should throw some chilli powder on this uncle""s face" @Lorraine Naidoo Which brand u got? hahahaha @Lorraine Naidoo We should get some of that Mother in laws tongue stuff Blerry hot stuff that lovely place @Lorraine Naidoo Whats his name Lorraine I dont know him @david cele Wassup No1 Hunter? sharp bro @goolamv No Goolam Bhai. They mean just now we will get to it.
Pitso Mosetlhe,its getting heated in here
HUSTLE FOR THAT MUSCLE,For the prejudiced line of Questioning @Thulani Bukani
wendy hardy,"Retaliation from him
makhosi nobhatyi,That was drafted at Saxon world This man is shielding Bullet and punches for Ace Magashule I can’t believe why he did this Did all of these things mentioned by mr Thabethe ever happened people? Those who stay there assist we are dealing with paperwork now I don’t think there was if it was happened for 6 months as I see @ Yolo More that’s what is how I see if there was little thing happened and channel all the money to Guptas 😃😃😂😂😂 Batohi is working on something here no doubt According to your research didn’t you recover these problems then? No this man now throwing beneficiaries into a failing of a project
Granny Mokwena,it's lies it's lies he always need to be reminded of the questions he's lying hence again I guess the dairy farm has produced hens instead
Yolo More,This one looks like he was dribbled. He doesnt look like he is corrupt. Maleka is always in court. I think he left the commission. I doubt if there is something helpful that will come out of his testimony. Makhosi Nobhatyi it looks like the only thing that ever happened was to give the Guptas millions of rands. Yho! Not yet completed. Zuko Nodada he does not give the names. Is this man 60 years already or it was an early retirement? Ja Anne M. he looks young. Pastor J hahaha Liz Profe and a brown envelope as well why? This man speaks like Hlaudi. "Mzalwana mzala pause please this is not a pulpit. And the charges were dropped Mzala? "Hahaha Raven Poor farmers never tasted a brown cent out of this. Smart? All I know is that I feel sorry for all the accounting officers whose careers and reputations were destroyed by the politicians. "Wilson the most corrupt Province "Rad NEVER "Spill the beans Mr Bonang hahahahaha Where is i? it "goolamv Liar Whats going on SABC? They deleted
barbara broadbent,If that is the case then he is really stupid!!! Sooner rather than later we hope!!! To cover up their wrong deeds!!! Yep !! When is this guy finished his testimony? "So Mzala more charges coming................... 😀😀😀😀 Provisionally the magic word!! Aren't you glad your not here anymore?? the present PP? You must be a lawyer Mzala? "that would be a red cent "the way he explains it all "He believes his own lies "The truth lies in the poor "All of a sudden he knows what is too expensive
ernest seikano,"he was just a tool heiiiii Wacha mokhukhu but they should bring back what belongs to our country early retirement
Elvio Gujwa,long unending journey
Dominic Przybylski,Either corrupt or totally negligent and incompetent. "Probably has $millions in Dubai bank account How do they verify beneficiaries? What would stop Ramaposa from getting on the list to get his buffaloes milked for free. Somebody drove around with a loudhailer inviting anyone who wants to be a beneficiary. Why should Estina register a company for beneficiaries? Considering they had a R17million plan they don't seem to have followed any plan (except the Gupta one). They whole medical industry is about to be nationalised. Land is about to be nationalised. Soon we will have no alternative to corruption. We will get nothing back. We got nothing back from the sale of all our oil reserves for $20 a barrel. "I want to see the R17million plan @Zuko Nodada spot on. That's what happens when a government takes tax. It did not struggle to make it so it doesn't care if it wastes it. This man took no responsibility. Somebody must have been paying him to look the other way. This man's casual neglect is highly suspicious. Either he is lying or he is totally reckless. The practice of looking the other way. "Apartheid time I was forced into military service In this country we are having our personal money stolen from us every day. They call it tax. Estina were sole beneficiary. Estina had one director and no employees. @Mzalwane Mzala Thanks for the info. Nobody cares about how well they spend their money as much as the person who earned it. That's why capitalism survives and socialism fails. I believe Estina report has been set aside due to failure on review. @Lorraine Naidoo adjourns for tea lunch and weekends. "This government appoints agents and contractors to do the real work "List of beneficiaries: Ajay Inflated services are allowed. It's called BEE I thought environmental impact asessment was paid for in the R17 million plan. @Mfanafuthi Gama How many administrators do you know? "Only register them once all the money has been looted """Done."" Were they registered as shareholders and/or directors?" Estina spent nothing They started preparation to spend their money. i.e. they had spent nothing.

Derek Main,"Worse than not getting anything back @Anne M. Neither does our government. @Mfanafuthi Gama Then how did he allow the Guptas to rip off so much money? @Wilson Hishono Free State Seems like the bots are out working for Thabethe @Wilson Hishono Maybe originally but they are dealing with the Estina dairy project in Free State so he must be from there now. He was / is FS Agriculture HOD @Mfanafuthi Gama The issue is that he thinks the bare minimum is sufficient instead of asking the necessary hard questions before spending millions of taxpayer money. @Mfanafuthi Gama You obviously haven't been listening to all of his testimony. DCJ Zondo went on at length asking why he didn't find out more about Estina before partnering with them. He said he didn't think it was necessary. Did what yesterday sir? "@Abel Matshidiso If his education is as poor as he seems to think it is
Liz Profe,beneficiaries have not ever seen a cent!! junior lawyer lol consulting costs loads of money stupid has no limit clearly😂 as we all watch SA heading to collapse who employed this v now is explains a lot of rubbish again they should call for the bank statements of these people....there will be big surprises there no doubt "always passing the blame to somebody else

Dylan Jacklin,Gross negligence personified
Mzalwane Mzala,Was a case not dropped against this guy? Some of those who comment here don't know that Thabethe was arrested and charged for Estina last year. "He faced charges of fraud The NPA provisionally dropped the charges in November 2018. The Public Protector made adverse findings against him. He lost his job due to the public protector report that said nothing about politicians. Division of Revenue Act (DORA) @barbara broadbent The present PP The PP report was successfully challenged in court for failing to investigate politicians and focusing only on officials. It would be interesting to see whether he can claim his job back based on the setting aside of the PP report. They were charged based on Hawks investigations. @goolamv If I recall correctly at the beginning he said he was suspended without pay based on the PP report and when he heard nothing after that he asked for his pension. pension

Compliance for the benefit of the citizens is no legally required and salaries are paid to people with pockets.

Joseph Akwa,This guy shows everything wrong with govt doing things for on behalf of the people. Govt (or rather the people who work for govt) assume that the people are incapable of decision making. Reallt? Did somebody from SA have to go all the way to India to find expertise to do fiary farming in SA?. This is fraud & corruption par excellence. These things raise serious questions about what government employees who are paid huge salaries really do? May be the DJC must recommend in his report that govt employees must do real work.
