Bev Daniels,I think the Eben Etzebeth story has been taken too far. Listen to the videos regarding the group that attacked his group about saying that they must stab him Mr Zondo must be extremely EXHAUSTED Duduzane is as innocent as my last straw of hair "Singi "Denies meetings "HI Rudi "Rudi Again Uncle Fana "Nolunthando "Daniel it is his own advocate Aunty dudu Muyeni zuma should ask the Zuptas for money. She can afford lawyers ? Yes they supposed to work for 7.5 hours as they are paid by the State and that is the hours with 30 mins lunch not an hour.
Sam Saiya,where is Duduzane "we want to hear Duduzane Do twins think alike Arrest the boy and stop wasting our time how old is this kid he has to be the youngest former president in the world. The boy was running the country "Yes i clever le ntwana yaz
Lucas Sibeko,Morning guys
Petro Forsyth,Let us just stop attacking one another and stand together at least against corruption!
Eliot Chauke,Thuli must refute Duduzane under Oath... "Jonas must be charged fr Wasteful expenditure and negligence... how can he leave his VIP Protection Unit and go with a stranger WMC used Julius to deal with Zuma... now WMC is using Pauli to deal with EFF... Zuma is innocent. everything is fabricated by WMC Guys. Lets take Eskom fr example... WMC have contracts fr 80 years😁 and thy supply 95% of coal. but we r worried by 5% of Gupta. like really now 95% of eskom budget goes to WMC. u dnt question tht. only concerned by 5% to Gupta. Ruppert must come... he must answer on the allegations of Currency manipulation. together with Maria Ramos @Derek @free Ruppert said Zuma must replace Des Van Rooyen as Finance minister otherwise they(WMC) will bring the Rand to its knees. @derek. Mbalula testified under Oath @free my source is Mbaks not CiC @derek Duduzani is an Honest man DCJ must shut up @derek so u blv Jonas ddnt know wher he was going? who he was gna meet? wat was the meetng about? he knew nothing? @derek which version do u find convincing? btwn Jonas and Zuma jr? on the question i askd bfr @Jack Sparrow not Jamnandas please @Jack Sparrow Jamnandas is a Gangster he's very dangerous. National hero my foot "@derek so Jonas knew nothing? remember we paid fr his bodyguards @Sfiso stop dreaming... wake up @Jack Sparrow Zuma was removed by EFF... @Sfiso zuma resigned @Sfiso EFF put impeachment motion. Zuma realised he lost ground in anc and wont survive EFF motion. the best thing was to resigned. ANC defended Zuma 8 times in Parliament. 2 times during NEC meetngs "Cyril got money from Oppenheimer... its fine. Zuma got money from Gupta
Mlondi Jali,I'm just here for Duduzane Zuma's English...
Lorraine Naidoo,morning Dudu Myeni got no money to attend the court case Shem what happened to all Bossa money watching it on tv she says his lying
Drikus Olifant,jaja tony is my men
mandisi ntauzana,Raymond is late again Duduzane Zuma looks like a younger version of Sibusiso Zuma Stats SA must do a detailed report on how much hearing time relative to cost we've spent. "This commission waste a lot of time by starting late "Raymond must account and tell us why we can't have 7 Hour oral evidence day
Tony Better SA,"Mr. Zuma junior is very clever... all he did yesterday was further his fathers conspiracy theory narrative i.e. ""there is a plot to discredit me""" Did you notice his files were prefixed with LL - Liar Liar
Mzimasi Ludziya,morning guys...let the game begin
khalidntokozo,Duduzane is innocent You taught him johnny boy You taught him johnny boy No Zuma did not that’s your opinion Thuli madonsela a media attention monger He is trying to crack him DZ won’t crack Derik Main is a lie detector Duduzane Zuma = Micheal Corleone Duduzane Zuma scenario is David among Goliaths
Graham Jackson,Hi again DJP Zondo treated another Zuma with kid gloves.
G T,Morning. Advocate Louw is first up this morning. A no nonsense seasoned man. Should be interesting!! Only a fool judges a matter he has not heard in its entirety. Since when does a young boy mediate between two grown men in our culture? These are not his parents and in fact he had never met Mr. Jonas before. I guarantee you Mr. Jonas only agreed to meet him because he was the Presidents son. This is his advocate. His sole reason for being there is to make DZ look credible!
funicanz,dudu myeni the legend
Person of interest,I hope Zondo saw Madonsela's comments Duduzane is a smooth operator "don't doubt Zondo LL = Lekker Lieg!
Patrick Raphuti,I guess he saw it Agreement Mokoena you have a problem Mr DCJ? Agreement you have a problem with DCJ/ OK Lets share the concern?
TheC4RB1N3,"They should jail the corrupt people "Getting rich by stealing tax payers money 🤑 - Duduzane 🤔 "WMC is Bell & Pottinger  and lying with a straight face "Eskom is corrupt You can use common knowledge Zondo was picked out by Zuma yes go check appointed by Mogoeng "Zuma put the names forward Zuma knew he was gonna get Zondo Duduzane Zuma lied to Zondo commission -Thuli Madonsela yeah lol 🤯
Thulani Mthembu,Msholozi💪🏾
Annalie Elizabeth,Why was Duduzane reading off his tablet during testimony yesterday? It looked as if someone was sending him messages His tablet looked as if it was behind the folders and he was scrolling on something which looked like a tablet I am not mad-JUST VERY OBSERVANT Thank you Celuthando Go and look at the recording Wise timing for Thuli to announce the lie Duduzane clearly went to a private school Go through the recording 50:00 and further Why do Duduzane only have white lawyers? Printing? I thought he had a concern about the environment
Sthakathi Khumalo,"Lols... you guys are mad "Haaai maan "Lols Celuthando "But you are not listen to Zondo Thuli Madonsela is no Hero suka!! "Lols.. you don’t have to insult "Journalists have always been captured There is nothing to celebrate about Madonsela!! She had an agenda "Heat the English of this young man I am not saying English is a measure before y’all pounce on me Where is celumusa?? The same people who were saying the young man reads from a tablet🤷🏽‍♂️ A smart individual thinks before they talk!! Very respectful young man-uncle Fana he says🙌🏻 Where is Celumusa and that Elizabeth lady who were seeing tablets?? "Lucky Benya it’s not his fault he was born into a silver corrupt spoon The term WMC does not mean one hates white people in general..!! Hoerskool lols Where is the Tablet😏??? "Guys stop acting like "Don’t come with that ageism thing wena You appoint whom ever you want as your lawyers!! GT you asked how can a young man mediate and I gave you my scenario.. you are just not being genuine to this conversation!! Thandeka why are you like this?? Corrupt money apparently makes people attractive😝😝 "I man confused "Thulz Nkoni you are spot on Derek Main The young man has learned a lot from his daddy😂😂😂😂 "That isn’t water "Forget it "Songezo that’s is scientifically correct The problem with him is he also adds accent to his teachings and ziyanyisa lezizinto😂😂 Mlamuli yes!! They are dealing with credibility and right now he is painted as as more honest than Jonas Nope was nearly followed by My Guy haha Zondo feeling left out shame "Like father like son.. but lentwana yona iyasginqa isingisi!! Anyways "I agree people don’t listen "The lawyer is doing the things hey The poor young man was not given a chance😝 "Well rehearsed or not Zondo feels left out even!! So now they are bringing Gupta statements... or am listening to something else CR17 is apologizing in Nigeria Nebraska making all sorts of promises 1988 and 35🤷🏽‍♂️ The problem is y’all don’t listen. The boy is clear and Zondo understands!! Ayanda Lools.. "The way Zondo is probing on the office space "There is something I don’t understand guys "Is State Capture only limited to Guptas and Zuma or they are looking at this thing holistically.. I am even confused Dankie Cheese boy!!

Thuli has never and will never seek attention from the media. people hate her because of the stealing work she did during her time as PP.

Masoul Mt,Zondo dealing we media propaganda you see media propaganda false reporting by the media thank you Zondo for setting the record straight MEDIA PROPAGANDA AGAINST ZUMA EXPOSED Sthakathi yes people will overlook what Zondo has just said Yes media CHECK YOUR FACTS AND BE FAIR
Speckled Trim,Was News24 one of those? The media is not free to do as they please. Capture must be investigated there as well. Why did they move all historical news articles to the dark web? All SA Press Association news articles published between 1998 and 2015 have been removed from the internet to hide history. "Guptas "The country is captured by a new group every year
Muzamani Ronald,Zuma's ar going to jail This advocate is marvelous
makhosi nobhatyi,Uyadelela ngoku Zuma rhaaaaaa Please mr not uncle Fana here call him mr Duduzane Zuma planned this with uncle Fana Did Duduzane sort rumors before with other people? Why this two comrade? "@Zakes Om remember it was not Zuma who wanted this commission Zuma didn’t want these proceedings happened I believe he still does  Zuma was hiding himself with privilege to appoint and fire without disclosing reasons. When a company fire you must give you reasons Lie he runs away when Hawks was looking for him and Guptas Comfort break
Greg Rowles,"@Rock882 Josh well obviously the Guptas did nothing wrong "@Enzo2000 YES what's the opposite of White Monopoly Capital? @Greg Rowles is it (black) Economic Vandalism? "@Ryan SA Ah "i'll bet the Gupta's ""facilities"" all had recording devices for black mail" "White Monopoly Capital is also brainwashing African children under the guise of ""education""" @Eliot Chauke - pls share the link that gave you that information? I'm sure it's not correct "@Rock882 Josh this country is k##ked "@nkagisang Hilda Masha best at stealing @rosalind gerber it's as absurd as black economic vandalism nepotism is awesome dude "going to fail BIGTIME in DUBAI he is much better "ha ha "Duduzane wasn't present for the entirety of that meeting !!! YESSSSS Did everyone miss that? DUDUZANE LEFT THE MEETING TO WORK ON ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES with ONE OF THE GUPTAS "DUDUZANE left the meeting he actually might be innocent ha ha sure "he was happy to be used "@Robert Russell he wasn't present for the offer to buy Nene Nepotism is for wankers and weaklings who are afraid to stand on their own 2 feet i hate children of politicians who benefit from it give up on this country going "we're all grown up now "tell you what - you get your ancestors and I'll get my ancestors "@Moses Sandile  "whites should only sell their lands to coloureds @Moses Sandile do you know what the population chart looks like for the different races from 1950 onwards?

WALTER MPENYANA,The Zuma surname is a damage to the ear
Derek Main,"If I had a choice of who to believe - Thuli Madonsela or Duduzane Zuma @MCEBISI MBUSI Why listen to a racist fascist? @Sthakathi Khumalo Yes - Modonsela's agenda was told hold criminals to account. You have to be a complete idiot to think Duduzane is innocent. @Eliot Chauke Are you a Guptoid? @Muzi Ntuli Uncle Fana is a crook. He's lying - his lips are moving. @Sthakathi Khumalo Pull the other one. @zakes om BS - Thuli Madonsela ordered that Zuma could not appoint judge or set up commission because he was implicated. @TheC4RB1N3 No he wasn't - that's BS. @TheC4RB1N3 You go and check. Madonsela ordered that a commission be set up and that Zuma could not select because he was implicated. Check. @TheC4RB1N3 Exactly. @SACR FOUNDATION Zuma appointed Zondo as a judge but didn't appoint him to run this commission. @TheC4RB1N3 Zuma was not allowed to put names forward because he's a crook. @Sthakathi Khumalo Yes - you can't trust anything about him - not even his accent. @TheC4RB1N3 BS Did Duduzane search the whole house to see if the Guptas were there? @Sthakathi Khumalo Yes - both consummate liars. @TheC4RB1N3 No surprise. @Eliot Chauke Is that state capture? @nkagisang Hilda Masha Yes - they both have the criminal gene. @Eliot Chauke And you have evidence of this? @Eliot Chauke Sounds like BS to me. @Eliot Chauke Duduzane is testifying under oath and lying through his teeth. What's your point? @Samkelo Nxele Yes - there is plenty of evidence that has been voiced here. He also fought tooth and nail to stop spy tapes. Schabir Shaik was found to have a corrupt relationship with Zuma. Plenty. "@Eliot Chauke ""Duduzane is an honest man"" - only to fools." @Samkelo Nxele His day is coming - it's an avalanche right now. @Eliot Chauke Jonas is ANC as well so I don't trust him either. They're all corrupt. "@Samkelo Nxele Yes - that's what I'm saying. And furthermore @Eliot Chauke I am more inclined to believe Jonas because he had nothing to gain by making his statement. Zuma has everything to lose if Jonas is correct. @JoziTube To put the guilty in jail. @JoziTube I tend to agree with you but am hoping that's not the case. @Parabridge I'm too honest to succeed in that way. @Bongani Ntuli It's meant to start at 12h15 @Bongani Ntuli No problem - enjoy the game. @Charlene Botha It's always been like that though - look at Rupert and Oppenheimer's - same thing. @Luckey Binali 🤣 Bring on the next liar.
mickey smith,journalists need to look at themselves in their ethics mirror
Jane .Blamire,"Madonsela says Duduzane Zuma lied to the commission when he testified that she had failed to give him the opportunity to respond to damaging state capture claims against him Business Day reported.

Khaya Nomoyi,A business associate of the Guptas can never ever be clean when it comes to corruption.He is lying with a straight face and think he is clever. This lawyer think he is doing the best for Duduzane but the judge can see through that he is lying. He has been arranging meetings between different ministers and the Guptas and he thinks their evidence should be overlooked and only his version is the right one.Unyile.

We are on the TIMEX here!!!!!! I don't take people to my house either..Especially friends of friends..Plus I suspect the Gupta's have SERVANTS Sounds like there was a fight after the meeting at the Gupta's.

At least Cloudy admitted he loved the Gupta Curry and had it many times Has this young Zuma paid maintenance to his previous wife? I remember the court had to force him to do the right thing...Abandoning your own child makes you a really bad person. Zondo must subpoena the Guptas.
