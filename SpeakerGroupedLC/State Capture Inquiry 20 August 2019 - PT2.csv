G Ellis,"Yes project was progressing well hhahahahahahahahaaaaaaaahahahahahaha I ordered a Gupta Milkshake at Wimpy. They said it was R30 million. This guy passes the buck so well they should call him Kudu. Zondo still awake people don't have a slice of bread to put on the table and these guys are losing tractors as though they're nothing.
Alonzo Trier,"""there was a vet""... 200 Million+ project!!!" err Chair!
Dirk vd Westhuyzen,"Just like in the rest of SA foooket It takes a lot of time to count and split the cash @Vuyisile Ngesi correct - compare this idiot with the lead Adv . This guy takes no responsibility - apart from counting the cash in brown boxes Contractor from India ?????: is this guy ok upstairs Sure he had a lot of confidence in ACE @Vuyisile Ngesi hope he and his fellow charlatans in the ANC get the long arm of the law soonest How in a million years can they recover 500 Mil from a dairy farm @ super low milk prices? The poor fellows with 5 cows would make absolutely nothing . What a sham we have idiots like this in government and have a say about budget @Mziwethu Ntombela connected and connections with the cabal @Thami Ngwenya dont ask question millions miles above his intellect @Raven Penny he was too stupid to see he was used "There was NO value for money - this man is more than suffering from delusion  How can you allow idiots to control budgets and implement budgets "Proper qualified milk farmers with best qualifications and first world farming can make money in the milk industry . How can this fool think he could - pay the farmers R 15 /l  "@William Pieters yes  "this poor fellow is in a job million miles above his ability  The commission should send him to the same place Oscar went for observations "@Raven Penny - yes  @muwanga soul roy Sangoma - he needs more than that. @Raymond Mabilo he was the perfect setup from the his ANC bosses above. He does not have the intellect to see it. @Carmen Hees liberation before education "@muwanga soul roy he is in fresh dung "This guy is finished  "@Yolo More Zondo is an old dog  @Carmen Hees this lady Adv is superb. @Mpotseng Mokhasi this ADV is great - agree with you . @Siyabonga Mbonyana imagine this ADV and Gerrie against you.... @Siyabonga Mbonyana üòÅüòÅüòÅ If you are in s&#t dont talk like a parrot or this guy "@johnny swinestein The Rothschild's run every single central bank except North Korea (nuke them) Somalia  @Thando Nkutha why dont you like Pretoruis @John Fagan üòÅüòÅüòÅ üçºüçºüçºüçºüçº üçºüçº Free State milk farm for officials
Rob Nel,Joppies vir boeties He was a Gupta appointee "The whole thing was a money vehicle "The advocate is doing a great job. But "Dude is deflecting Now he suddenly recalls very well???
Lourens De Jager,they where more worried about who gets more money. all the reports and research and they couldn't check they got what they paid for or check the cows have feed you need cows to milk "Zondo  surely that golden gate is stolen by now strike 3 your out maybe Zondo and the witness should change seats "as soon as the lady gets the witness seat hot  this witness would have been done by now. if he chose to tell the truth and spill the beans by the time the cows died so your lawyers told you not to feed the cows each party should bring there own cow surely that expensive gate should have kept the thieves out ?
Vuyisile Ngesi,this guy is a seriously useless and a sorry excuse for a Head of Department @Dirk vd Westhuyzen this chap is an embarrassment of note he is deliberately playing dumb and providing seemingly stupid responses to evade answering the questions - he clearly knows the answers but he has elected to lie through this front teeth...
Basimane Modise,"Not interested How much did he make out the project? A HOD who can't even speak properly and no listening skills at all
William Pieters,"Is this guy lol Urban Dictionary defines black excellence as: ‚ÄúSomeone that is black and portrays great qualities and abilities that make the black community proud.‚Äù. @Dirk vd Westhuyzen you hit the nail on the head. thx then he can be our next presadent. can't wait for the first part. thx . youtubes spell check sucks if you don't know the exact voles. soon he will start paging like Mr Zuma. why has he not name droped to save this hide?

Thami Ngwenya,Thug Does he understand cost analysis "Value for money you know before implementation "WRONG CANDIDATE FOR THE JOB TEACH HIM DC tHIS GUY GRADE 2 TEACHER
fikile mbokodi,hello guys how are the things there
Derek Main,@William Pieters No - just a typical ANC deployee. Are we still saying the ANC is not on trial?
Mingos Agrela,The evidence leader is brilliant Why does he not admit who orchestrated the whole project Please guys steer away from any kind of racist comments This lady Adv should be the next public protector BRILLIANT ADVOCATE
General Cyrus Gogo,Is this man still the HOD? Its a getaway kind of testimony and cover-up theory.
Pastor J.J,South Africa has 0.8% of the worlds population and 3.8% of the worlds unemployment and then we have people like this destroying every chance of changing the statistics dissappearing. @Way Cross ONLY YOU
carnoth ngomane,It was a money making scheme so he had nothing to monitor except what goes to the gupta pockets He clearly doesnt know what is value for money how do you not agree with the report if you havent seen it "but you said once soon he will deny that he is Mr Thabethe Zondo is doing a great job @Yolo More most bandits behave this way when they are in the spotlight @Yolo More but it sounds like there is no shred of truth in his testimony His lawyers are Ace & Zwane
Zaahier Adonis,file D for dom this gay focking with their minds Thabete is dik gevreet he wants to sleep now they can kill him i dont care Wasting a lot of money maybe we should capture Zondo

Nonzy,Mnxm That's how he got the job. He doesn't have a mind of his own and Ace needed someone who is a weak minded rat or a mole or something that crawls out of a sewer. Ace had found his man...
