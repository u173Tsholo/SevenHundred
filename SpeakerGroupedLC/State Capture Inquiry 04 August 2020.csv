Thulani Bukani,Molweni nonke maAfrika Is there a witness today?
watson mutanga,"I thought there was no hearing today
Barbara Sattler,@Watson ....and the beat goes on..... I think Mr. Zondo is glad to see Mr. Pretorious @Michelle it's for real. My daughter is a micro biologist. as easy as that Can you imagine if Kate H appears on the scene tomorrow at 5PM.. @Mike especially ACE @adrian there is a magnet implanted in the ballot paper. The pen also has a magnet the mind boggles @SalSA I think Tito M is not currupt
Sal SA,Watson they also hearing evidence from other witnesses this week. Zip that is offensive TK I blocked him too. Sad we still have people who do this Buyani you right Plus 194 it will be difficult to find an individual in the ANC who is not corrupt or not complicit. Barbara maybe I should not have generalized but the party is on control of the country and corruption runs deep. SA is bleeding
Ayanda Sokhela,yes. ace magashule to be summoned then? The Abestos saga was the worst kinf Zondo is extremely happy to see Pretorious. there you go! ace on the list Somebody give Zondo Azithromycin. That cough is just not going away. Is it necessary for Pretorious to spend more than 1 hour on heads of argument? Why cant all this information be dealt with when the witnesses come through to testify?
Sharmayne Venkatsamy,"this venue has a lot of challenges - sound
rock star,yay. pretorius is back
Thulani Ndzuzo,Morning fellow south Africans
Melvict Melbourne,Pretorius is looking tired. @Solly 12 How did CR became a rich man? TB is also real @Solly 12 dob't act dumb People that benefitted and are benefitting from BBBEE can't do anything about corruption because inherently to get a benefit without adding value or contributing in the value is corrupton Do we really expect high profile cadres to be locked up? @Suicidal Animal is your IQ to low to follow? @Mncedisi Mthethwa all just wasting more moola @Mncedisi Mthethwa the first high profile to be charge will claim witch hunt @Kerry van Schalkwyk shame is a western trait. the masses see it as white money been stolen. @Mncedisi Mthethwa it is a joke. In the next ward election the cadres will win again. As long as the T shirt is given the votes keeps comin CR is a lame duck... @Mike Clark the masses will not vote differently. The cultural and tribal setup will ensure that. @Craven Morehead before the virus on average 55 families were arriving in AUS. These are mostly families where two people were taxpayers. Krugersdorp has one "there is a group on Facebook breeding less is the first step in reducing poverty Remember you can't compare SA with any first world country. The UK has nearly as many taxpayers as south Africa's unofficial unemployment figures @L Ll what is wrong with separate development? Freedom of association as per the constituton. It is dangerous "Yes @L Ll toughen up What the liberal news told h some are still savages @pius194 are you a rat? I prefer to live amongst my own people @pius194 it is only the EFF rats that talk about wmc @L Ll you sound like a stuck record I'm making R1400 per week on a R21300 investment "@Craven Morehead not a scam at all @L Ll or both aaa @Jacqueline Jayamaha who are you when yu're not at home? Does the first L stand for liar? Ninja Turtle is taking a lot of tea breaks lately. Goat...isn't that English for Pakistani> Black head...I prefer Red head Bullying? turn yur hearing aid up mae mate :virtualhug: @dennis oldude there is no political will to do that. CR is just talking. The daughter of a Pietermaritzburg man says her father died in inhumane conditions in a makeshift facility for suspected Covid-19 patients in the parking lot of a local hospital. the unions are complaining about joblosses while they were the ones supporting the thugs :elbowcough: Just one high profile thief need to be jailed then the rest will crumble what is the purpose of these reports and findings when nothing is done about it? I just hope that ANC win the next 3 elections @adrian albertyn tribal pressures "But in sub-Saharan Africa @Ntuthuko Lukhanyo Kwela what is incorrect? @lawrence muhle judged by you numbers you didn't starve. Yes...murdered?:) @sifiso ngubeni is that now the patch in North Africa? @pius194 want to farm 🙂 Just like Cyril the Squirrel it seems that Mashaba is the new savior.
Peter-Junior Segoe,..
Tony Jantjies,Lets look how he present him self today
zip reeper,hope pretorius has the satisfaction of seeing corruption put to bed by the time he retires "tk run by:oops::oops::oops: youtube must remove this:oops:icon. will get me into trouble! "more action at the ceaucesco trial the prosecutors produced the noose right there in court 🤣 "keith
Abel Matshidiso,"mrng South Africans who's d witness fellow South Africans
kevindbn007,Shu the rot runs deep how can 500billion be spent in 3 months CR's COVID19 Fund y didnt you send a picture Dan CR is waiting for cAncer to eat itself "its too blatent now "from 2009 till 20018 1 Trillion rand was borrowed to fund ""projects""" and still no electricity/water or basic education was not achieved in the rural areas
Logic before Authority,are they getting anything solved? who spent 500 bil I wish they would decide if covid is real or cover up to arrest the cabals/corrupt/criminals I figured it was to certain degrees
Dan Brown,"R650 to look at a roof and say ""Yep that's asbestos""" I would have done the Asbestos assessment for R100 a house and still smiled.
Solly 12,Hard to understand how Ramaphosa can be so weak in dealing with corruption "Melvict Melbourne I don’t have enough information on that Melvict Melbourne just spill it out if you know something & stop being crass Funny that people don’t wanna talk bout those who benefited from apartheid
Willem Drotsky,Google map thats all. You never know what up or not. You cannot measure a virus that mutate continuously.
Mike Newlands,"@Melvict Melbourne a fair question. He didnt create anything "You would think with all this exposure of blatant ANC theft from ""our people"" they would have stopped. But now we read of Ace' son's Profit of R100m for nothing but children drown in pit toilets & the ANC is fine with this! "@Melvict Melbourne surely not. I struggle with that but given the control of the news of SABC & collapse of newspapers I accept the ""masses"" are poorly informed." So fellow inmates who feels there is a tide of serious unhappiness in our country with the ANC & this exposure of corruption we are witnessing. From CR office downwards "@Suicidal Animal It has fallen @dennis oldude call the NPA (No Prosecution Association) you jest of course "So somewhere in Lootfreely House ANC cadres are watching this munching a steak & egg sandwiches chuckling away. Mercs in the garage @Barbara Sattler Ace must be laughing his head off. He makes the EFF VBS thieves amateurs @Stronger together no no we voted them in its us who need a mental institution "@沒有人 True "Watching Zondo corruption @Garth Andre apardheid did me no favours but all the ANC had to was take over a gov. that worked expand it to ALL the people. But the ANC became a criminal enterprise witness the Zondo commission.
Martin Chauke Bedfordview SA,Why do an audit on something that is already on records? These houses did not fall from heaven! It was obvious roofing material was made from asbestos.
Keith Fallick,ZIp - When he retires or dies.

Moonchild,"Glad to see Adv Pretorius leading today - competent "@Mike Clark - yup - fool me once shame on you "@Carl Botha - yes "@Carl Botha - oh right
Eugene,WHASSAAAP ? he doesn't make any sense.. he's white ofcourse not. they are above the law. they are the law Melvect I'm Just really tired 😴😴 everyone gets affected Blame Starvation on Apartheid even though there was food security back then. Brand suid afrika! AFRICA IS FALLING!!! 🔥 WHEN WILL WE STAND UP AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT? OR WILL WE WAIT UNTIL SA LOOKS LIKE VENEZUELA? or never do anything about it and become a Zimbabwe. "Apartheid was more like ""intergration"" millions of black people emigrated to South Africa during Apartheid."

Kgomarediyakokotane Nna,i like the way Mr Pretorius explaining
Mncedisi Mthethwa,@Melvict Melbourne I doubt @Melvict Melbourne the commission functions is to send recommendations then the law enforcement's act on it but they are not going to do that. This has been going on for many years with no arrest @Mike Clark unfortunate most people are not exposed to what the ANC is doing and they will keep voting for them "@Melvict Melbourne ANC NEC apparently had a meeting about corruption in the party and that meeting was a joke @Pienaar van Wyk that land belongs to comrades. ANC don't care about people The day we come together as the citizens of this country maybe that's the day we will able to remove this pandemic and move on. The honest truth 26 years is a very long time to do nothing for the poor .... those using it. @Thami Ngwenya that is a very difficult question. All we have now is corrupt individuals waiting for that state purse GOVERNMENT HAS NO JOBS OR CREATE ANY JOBS

Buyani Mhlongo,Block Suicidal Animal "Its hard to admit that the State Capture will continue for many years to come  "since Corruption continues everyday and the majority of ANC parliament members don't care and More money is further spent in this commission its sad @Richard Ward Which is why everytime a new ANC president gets elected they go to kiss her hand lol lol lol lol ​@Richard Ward How can a Queen have billions while her people suffering it doesn't make sense @L Ll Lower or High in UK? "@Naledi Barron Don't Speculate  @Naledi Barron Rather say the majority "@Naledi Barron I am certain you don't travel entire UK "@Naledi Barron Or a research paper @Bev Daniels Age is just a number @Naledi Barron buyanimhlongo@gmail.com @@Ayanda Sokhela It is a waste of time and money since everyday certain amount of thousands is spent.
Richard Ward,"I know black people who benefitted greatly from apartheid. They got free education "I`v now been in the UK for almost 20 years "The Queen does not have billions 600 homeless white educated british nationals have been dying on the streets per year for the last 5 years. Large companies in UK have been doing all recruitment in India and Srilanka and Pakistan "Google things like food vouchers uk "Corona has claimed so many lives in the UK because the UK do not hire the British "They are not going hungry because of the churches "Naming the previous SA gov as Apartheid "Most Asbestos was removed by the previous gov.

Carl Botha,"Morning all "@Kerry van Schalkwyk And there I thought I changed the channel @Craven Morehead ENCA srewing up big time lately @pastor J and @bianca A you guys not in today? @Stronger together thought they would move here as chat is disabled "@L Ll Just as a matter of interest @L Ll Who was responible for Segregation? "@l l It does not chagne it "@L Ll Yes but who was responsible for it "@L Ll So who was it "@L Ll yes it did "@L Ll Yes it did is in the past @L Ll You can only get up dust yourself of and make a better future. @L Ll and I am not referring to German concentration camps @Stronger together Totally agree! @L Ll is Goat from ENCA chat room "@Stronger together Hang them "@沒有人 Agree @Stronger together CR is Scar @Barbara Sattler 🤣🤣🤣 @Craven Morehead I think so to "All the money that was looted @lawrence muhle 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @lawrence muhle ok Juluis @Pastor J Does a honest politician exist 😁 @Mncedisi Mthethwa 👌👌👌 When will they be putting someone in the HOT Seat @plus 194 So did it in Zim and now its all Moer toe @sifiso ngubeni and then there will be even less left of SA Hot Seat Time? @Craven Morehead Copy paste 😂 SA is like the medieval times CR is King ANC cadres the Lords and Ladies and the rest phesants.
Elvis Malakoane,Carl Botha Goodmorning Carl I see we homeless today enca is messed up Jackson van staden you joking right? people we faced with a country moving back to looting and corruption at a high scale You busy talking about Apartheid Are fools or Morons you* I AM SURE IF YOU GUYS CAN CHANGE THE SUBJECT YOU WILL HAVE NOTHING ELSE TALK ABOUT sifiso ngubeni are you sure about that sifiso?
Origin Bila,I would love to see the buget spend from the state money to fund these commission and the money will these commission recover because now these is a waste of money while unemployment is rising daily
Jacqueline Jayamaha,this is a joke
Craven Morehead,ANC will do anything to make sure whites don’t get business. They will rather give inflated and corrupt contracts to cadres with no experience. Ignoring established businesses with experience Why did enca disable the chat? Highly educated people are leaving this country at an alarming rate guys. Even people finishing bachelor degrees are immediately looking for jobs over seas Big trouble coming @L LI munsieville outside joburg is one @L LI there are also a few around north of Pretoria @L LI I know but look for housing estates and housing associations in the UK if you wanna see white poverty there "@L LI why don’t you go ask them how they’re doing? I doubt they are enjoying their lives @L LI where are you from? @Melvict Melbourne yup it’s controversial but it’s true. China instituted a one child policy to curb their massively growing populations while they were still trying to get over poverty @L LI I agree the reasons for homelessness are based on individuals and their life choices. The point I’m trying to make is that the myth that poverty only effects black people in SA is not true @pius194 why? Isn’t asbestos extremely toxic? So this cadre didn’t care about health or safety they just wanted the tender. As per usual @L LI how do you know apartheid if you from the UK??? @pius194 poverty is everywhere in SA bro. Yes the free state has been ravaged by Ace and his friends. No service delivery there and no job opportunities @L LI but you speaking as if you experienced it on a personal basis ? @L LI but what do you really know about apartheid? Be honest "Apartheid was a horrible system that was dehumanizing and was ultimately destined to fail. I will not say the current ANC is our savior though Cadres are corrupt and ANC uses its structures to protect corrupt individuals. Collective responsibility and collective leadership just means nobody can be held accountable. ANC is criminal Apartheid is a easy thing for ANC to scream whenever they are being exposed for incompetence or corruption or even murder (Marikana and life esidemini) those from the UK should google Marikana before Before making noise here @L LI I agree. What do you think of BEE then ? I white kid can get a 70% average in matrix and will struggle to get into a government university. Instead of increasing uni capacity the ANC decided to segregate some more @L LI are you actually English or are you just living in the UK. @L LI I’m just interested to see where you are coming from @L LI it’s funny you say that because many people today find it important that we recognize who did wrongs in the past @L LI a lot of people are making a big fuss about who practiced it? If we’re to just say what’s done is done then why would we need BEEE or affirmative action? @Bronx Wavy we all come from Africa bro. Cradle of human kind. @Melvict Melbourne yeah right lol.... forex trader scammer @L LI are you actually English or are you just living in the UK? @L LI you started this argument and you brought apartheid up So we South Africans will actually tell you what it was like. Unlike you using second hand sources @L LI why won’t you answer? It’s just a normal question? @L LI were you born in the UK? I wanna see something @L LI I have a hunch you weren’t born there and that you aren’t British... prove me wrong @L LI are you Indian? No Harmless @L LI I don’t believe you @L LI lol ok fair enough. Can we focus on the Zondo commission without you being apartheid up every 5 minutes? I would appreciate that thanks @L LI yeah hahaha this has gotten very messy hahaha 😂 let’s focus on the commission guys The scariest thing happening in SA today is the fact that ANC cadres are sitting on the boards of large corporate companies. Big corporate in this company has been bowing down to governments Is there a witness today? Literally if we put two ministers in jail corruption will drop drastically Who is testifying today ??? Bro get to the matter @adrian albertyne grants. ANC tells people that if they are voted out of power the grants will also go Yes because ANC tells people in the rural that if ANC goes away it will go back to apartheid... a lot of people believe this Yes because they know once people get educated they will wake up to ANC corruption and looting @Person of Interest what’s really evil is that after 26 years they still using a water truck. All that time and they didn’t build water pipes an infrastructure Too much money in water truck tenders Yup the sad truth of SA. Thugs and criminals win and the hard workers and honest people get destroyed "ANC IS CORRUPT!!! we are not fkn children bra The reality is in South Africa if you want to steal you just steal big. Small criminals get caught but big criminals are untouchable Giving land to useless cadres or to people that don’t want to farm destroys the economy and food security. EFF has brainwashed many people telling them land = wealth.... lol think again "Go ask any young black person if they want to farm in the rural areas. Most will say they left rural to come to the city "@pius194 so go and farm then?? Nobody is stopping you? There are many black commercial farmers...go wena. Growing some spinach and commercial farming is very different "All you have to do is look at sharpville and Marikana. Different government @pius194 does that mean it’s right? Also ANC’s land policy is completely different to EFF’s land policy. Same question why don’t you go farm now if you want to? What’s stopping you? @lawrence muhle yes that must be it... if something goes wrong in SA it must be whites. Black government can do no wrong ... even when they loot it’s still whites fault? Wanyela True @Mncedisi Mthethwa Yes we are carrying a heavy burden of all these failed states around us. Everyone in Africa wants to come here for opportunity but what about us? Our unemployed graduates even? Yes Mashaba has my vote. He will save this country @Mncedisi Mthethwa you are speaking the truth here. Great mind. If EFF has a problem with Mashaba dealing with illegal foreigners then EFF can also go and try their nonsense somewhere else. I promise you now we will not let EFF govern. We will fight baba Will they ever bring Ace to this commission? He has been mentioned many times Mashaba must govern Or anyone other than the EFF basically. It’s a democratic country "Mashaba has proven he is capable of governing when he was mayor of joburg and he is speaking on real issues. Illegal foreigners @Naledi Barron and what about our children. Lol I always laugh when EFF says the state must own all land. Like the traditional leaders will let that happen.... lol there will be war. Don’t be immature @Naledi Barron how will we leave or children land when the state owns it all? What if I build on this land and then my lease ends and they take it with what I’ve built? It’s not gonna happen. Facts. It’s not even a question there will be war if EFF tries to take land. You think the Zulu kingdom is just gonna give malema all their land? Don’t be Dom Brown envelope rules in South Africa it’s a fact. In government and private business. Brown envelopes full with money are flying around The fact is the money is gone. This is taking so long that the looters have had enough time to hide their money @Naledi Barron I will get sentimental about what I want to. Especially if you spend your whole life putting everything into a piece of land. Then EFF comes and just takes it??? I would rather fight If government owns land they can do what they want with that land and they can do whatever they want with YOU. Wake up. Grow up Nothing is for free. We all have to work someday Why should gov even tell us what to do with our own property? EFF was created and is being paid by China to destabilize South Africa It’s obvious. Sorry I can’t tag you with those symbols haha Okay no problem @Unknown @Stronger together yes we all have to the right to life and to determine what we do with our life. I will not bow down to any government that wants to take my stuff. Even traditional leaders agree on On this. The earth was given to the people not governments and greedy criminals like EFF "If you think about it guys... if there was no government and we had community leaders instead our problems would be much less. Central control is a joke Can provide for 60 million people effectively ? It’s a pipe dream Government causes half of our problems @Melusi Sikakane communism has killed way way way more people in history than capitalism. Why do people constantly leave socialist and communist countries for capitalist countries? @sifiso Maharaj EFF is already corrupt hahahaha what about VBS? On point engineering? Your beloved EFF is controlled by forces in China and London... liberate your mind bro Yes we are a democracy and we have the right to voice our opinion in public EFF wouldn’t allow that Some communist shill Some judges are corrupt but to be honest South Africa has one of the best judicial systems in the world. Very free and fair like it should be How will EFF give people jobs? Doing what? Yes gov cannot create jobs @sifiso ngubeni what if we are clever? EFF blatantly lies to the poor. Selling them snake oil I trust in Mashaba We can disagree but still have respect for one another. Does EFF show respect to those who disagree with them? @Melusi Sikakane give me an example of WMC? You still believing the lies bell Pottinger told us? So they spent all that money to remove asbestos but it’s still there? Typical ANC looting @Craig Johnson IMF is not from Washington... secondly we received IMF COVID relief. Also would it be better that our economy collapses instead of IMF helping? And some of these asbestos houses are still standing in the free state Even though they paid to remove them Ya it’s sad... people are still dying but the cadres don’t care because they live very comfortable
L Ll,Richard Ward which towns in the UK have white squatter camps you are talking about? 😏 Unemployment in UK is different from unemployment in South Africa "Richard Ward you haven’t seen financial returns for the royal family Buyani Mlongo what I mean is unemployed people in the UK get assistance from the government unlike South Africa You just speculating and think it’s fact lol Craven Morehead in UK not South Africa Richard stop lying lol Housing associations are actually built houses not squatter camps like you are making people believe Stronger Together Richard Ward said there are white squatter camps in the UK that’s what I am asking him about lol Richard Ward they are not going hungry are they?

I don’t have to be in South Africa to understand what apartheid was about Bev your age is non of my business Don’t insult me by saying I don’t know anything about apartheid okay It’s not about where it came from it’s about apartheid being practiced in SA back then It’s like asking me who started racism. It’s a stupid question okay? Me to toughen up huh? 🤣😡 I know everything about apartheid It doesn’t matter what words you want to use to describe it It doesn’t change what happened Stop talking to me about apartheid then lol Segregation is still racism No human being should be treated differently because of the colour of their skin The question is was apartheid practiced in SA? Yes or no? It doesn’t matter who started it! Did it happen in South Africa? Yes or no? Richard Ward I don’t watch BBC lol Craven what has that got to do with apartheid? 😳 Carl I am talking about South Africa not India or America Stuck record because I refuse to agree with you huh? Carl it doesn’t matter who was responsible! Did it happen? Yes or no? Carl it doesn’t matter who practiced it! It happened! Period! Now what is for you to answer not me Don’t ask me stupid questions about apartheid when you know it happened lol What if they are all dead? Who is going to acknowledge apartheid? So why are you talking to me about apartheid if it’s in the past? "You started the conversation about apartheid and I refuse to agree with you Craven what has that got to do with you? What if I am female not Male? Lol It’s non of your business that’s why lol See what online? Are you mad? Craven yes I am both lol Prove you wrong for what? 🤣 Do I even know you? Okay how do I prove it here?

Bye guys lol Craven do you understand the purpose of central government? So how will that work? Lol Shaking my head lol
dennis oldude,RZ please stop justifying the malfeasance of the parties that you are investigating - based on technicalities - refer the whole bunch to the SIU and NPA and recover everything that they have stolen Lets not forget Aces's partner in crime -Mr DDM not the 2IC in the ANC? Right off the top there is enough evidence here to charge all the involved people with fraud and corruption - call the NPA? follow the money? He is lacking in the testicular area and the scavengers are part of the top 6 =- Ace DD and p[obably some of theri supporters Yes the boss of the NPA is also toothless and the top 6 will make sure that they never have enough resources to nail the thieves that we call the government

a b c,Every time I show up to this thing they're having tea... "@L LI I see you said segregation is still racism... that's not necessarily true... it only becomes racism if you're treated differently from a different race... segregation is more ""separation""" @R hunter nope @Stronger Together yes... they appeal to the emotions of the masses... particularly the black masses Uhm ok?? @Mike Clark true... it's disturbing when you still meet people who jump on you when you say anything about the ANC It's because of such people that the country doesn't move forward @Mike Clark man let's hope so... @Carl Botha Exactly... I've personally spoken to some such people and what you're saying is true... it's out of ignorance... "@Stronger Together your sentiments are admirable but the situation also has to do with the entourage... if the other ANC elite don't like you @Stronger Together what's more is that you'll need a party and in this country people can't agree on who should replace ANC @Pastor J The current system and situation in SA makes it rather difficult to be completely honest to become pres but honesty is much more admirable in the long run than dishonesty...
