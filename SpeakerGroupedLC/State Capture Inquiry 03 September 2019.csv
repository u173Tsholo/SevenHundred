Maria Raboshakga,Name and shame please Justice Zondo! "As for Nathi. Tjoh. Who would have thought really. Like they say
Pastor J.J,The Nonsense has started before anything has started. @Singi Mathebula Maybe they still hungry @makhosi nobhatyi .He is going to be blaming the Devil today. Thats him@Danie Nilsen This is his 3rd visit remember@Danie Nilsen @Immanuel Meeeeee 2nd that @Danie Nilsen Maybe so if one has the numbers for those that have been negatively impacted by all the stealing. 911 had over 3000 deaths sadly. @Derek Main It will be the most enjoyable and glorious moment when we hear that @Derek Main I absolutely agree. Karma is bad bro @Danie Nilsen You are spot on Danie. But the crooks dont care. @Derek Main I have over my many many years of living refused to travel to the USA or the UK. They have been Partners in all the crimes against so many innocent people. @I Am Free A beeeeeeeeeg one @Lee Hendrix A Might Big Amen to that @Danie Nilsen They wanted to make sure you and I didnt understand what was going on behind those dark doors @Gee Peex1 You are confusing what @Lee Hendrix is saying. He was speaking spiritually and not physically @Lee Hendrix You are 100%correct. "@Phillip Cwazibe Perhaps the intention was meant to be understood as ""from end to end and all around"" I could be wrong" @Phillip Cwazibe Absolutely. @Lee Hendrix By tomorrow he is going to be squeezed like how they should be milking those cows. eish "@Phillip Cwazibe I hear you. I once was asked to do a funeral service in a squatter camp. The Govt paid R1500 for a coffin but when I got there that they will not pay for the grave Instead of Milking the cows these BUGGERS milked Treasury. The couldnt read the script right @Raven Penny I recall that in my youth we used small fish as bait to catch the bigger fish. Not sure still if the big fish was stupid or i was clever.hahahahaha @I Am Free Not even the Prison Farm? Molefe @Born free Thats a skill that may or hopefully may not need my services.hehehehehe @Diss & Dad I absolutely think so. Particularly those held in the Vineyards rather than the Graveyards @Kevin Davis I totally totally and respectfully disagree with you. It is going to happen. Very soon It was clean until now. agreed "@Pedro P. The opening salvo from Kevi was ""all zulus are corrupt"". Do u agree and find that statement appropriate?" Thank you @Pedro P. same here Greetings to you @Jane .Blamire @Kevin Davis Did the school bell ring early today? @Kevin Davis I find it troubling how you so easily belive that you can insult an entire Proud Zulu nation simply because of how you feel about Zuma.? Dont you think an apology is necessary? @Kevin Davis But that does nor represent an entire Zulu Nation? or does it? Really!!!!!!!! @Kevin Davis I am saddened that you still do not see the need to apologise or withdraw your earlier hurtful statement. Very sad indeed. End of this line of interaction for me. me no @I Am Free I like.... I like.......I like @Mangalani Mangalani And lets not forget the highly successful farmer Uncle Eugene Terreblanche.hehehehehehe
Kevin Simon,Surely this situation existed since the witness was here the last time? Not very efficient I'm sorry!!!!! Only commenced at 14:00 today. "nonhlanhla ntombela ​I vote for Zuma n if he can come back I will vote again. WOW!!!!!!!! After the rot "nonhlanhla ntombela BLOCKED Pedro P. ​is India better in farming than SA??? They feed over a billion people with very little agri imports. So yes! "I've visited India many times before. Yes they may use dated technology and labour intensive methods but they do very well The scale of the population matters. The number of obese people in India is greater than SA total population. The number of poor probably exceeds RSA population many times over. sam soto ​I'm a scientists PhD?
Singi Mathebula,WhatsApp? adjournment just after lunch!
makhosi nobhatyi,Poor man Zwane is throwback on him now he must speak the truth who send him to do those things that is all @Gee Peex he sinking down and Zwane is running away leaving him in the mud whereas he directed this guy to do these decisions. I don’t feel anything for him now coz he is lying "@ Gee Peex he need to tell us who send him to implement the decision if no one said then he is guilty of looting money Evidence leader is on 👌👌👌👌👌 Hawks must arrest him This man is scared of mr Zwane This man has no qualifications 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ it is so embarrassing "@Derek main I agreed with you @ Danie Nilsen this man think we are playing here he supposed to be in jail coz money is not there @ Danie Nilsen I don’t understand how did this man not arrested he cannot make any sense about operation duties What more opportunities need to implement? Doom doom The lawyer representing mr Thabethe will run away too Nowonder Zwane didn’t gave two forms to sign by this guy fault and proper Only Zulu’s I must say @ Kevin Davis South Africa starts to turn against Zuma Only Zulu’s I must say @ Kevin Davis South Africa starts to turn against Zuma 😂😃😃😃Zondo is on fire Bullet after Bullet Kunuka ukunya apha qha this man makazikhulule please give me his number I would advice him achaze wathunywa ngubani @ Kevin Davis looking for mr Thabethe number
Elyou Rossouw,Commission of adjurnments He's knotting himself here. "@Gee Peex1  "Bornfree
Derek Main,He is ANC - he wouldn't know the truth if it jumped up and slapped him in the face. "Seems like Trump is soon going to hear someone say to him: ""You're fired!"" 🤣" @Pastor J 911 was a crime against US citizens by their own government. @Pastor J Amen to that. "@Pastor J If the US government is capable of doing that to their own citizens Exactly - the ANC government feels absolutely nothing for us citizens and our suffering. They only want the money. @Pastor J Yes - also have no interest in travelling there. They have a lot to answer for. @Born free Commission wasn't sitting this morning - only started at 14h00. @Neo Mjavell Yes - it is. Well spotted @makhosi nobhatyi It's called cadre deployment. @Diss & Dad Yes they have killed before. They run the FS like the mafia. Gangster state. @Diss & Dad That's more or less what he is in the FS. @Danie Nilsen No - it's spelt A.N.C. @Diss & Dad Magashule is still acting with impunity. @Diss & Dad He should be in a jail cell where he is not able to watch. @Dakalo Netili Exactly - that's their only interest - their own pockets. They feel nothing for the people of SA. Thanks for that you ANC voters. @Diss & Dad I'm smart enough to know that the entire ANC is corrupt to the core. "@Diss & Dad You look at every ward @Diss & Dad You've been in Germany too long. You lost touch with what's happening on the ground. "@Diss & Dad As for your ""agent"" comment "@Diss & Dad Of course "@Diss & Dad You know the story of the boy who cried ""Wolf!""" @Diss & Dad I'm glad you are able to make that concession - it's plain for all to see. @Born free ... and typing!! You're gifted.
Mobile Shope,squeeze him to zero balance
Lee D. Hendrix,"...Morals are not managed by the law or the church Gee Peex1 The woman did not create herself. "...Genesis is not understood concerning Man who was the last creation and there is no 8th day ...This guy is not going to admit his guilt. "Pastor J..He took the money shares by instructions "...The article was written to expose the theft of funds "...The Gupta s and clan are not coming back to Africa to answer questions  "...The project was established to receive the funds and to fail without a captor I Am Free..Implemented to acquire funds and then fail.
Neo Mjavell,SABC please correct the date - is NOT the 3rd Sep!!! @ Derek Main - the date is still wrong @ Danie Nilsen - Hahahahahahaha
Born free,No wonder I was unable to pick up State Capture this morning..3rd September 🙈 Da da da da wa wa wa wa OH thanks.. Derek 🤣🤣🤣yes Great project if they had implemented it instead of stealing from it. No opportunity because they stole from the project from the onset. Ch ch ch chair 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Now he must explain what happened to the money It could never have been one of the greatest projects because they kept stealing from the funds so it would never see an Implementation. Because the money that was allocated was not used for the project. and a small gate This is the reason poor people remain poor The witness is already implicated It was all an idea to steal allocated funds from Or lock you up It's not helping our Country at all. The rand has devalued. prices have rocketed and more people are unemployed. Those who voted the ANC should all pay back the money The cows died of starvation ssshhhh Danie A liar is a Lawyer. Best he does not have one. He chose not to have a Lawyer because it would make him look guilty. "Gee -peex. Take a chill pill or smoke a joint Driving and watching State Capture at the same time is quite a skill 😂😂😂I have time commitments. 🤣🤣🤣🤣Luckily I am ambidextrous
Nakrito Nakrito,this guy don't want to implicate himself The seat is getting 🔥🔥🔥 HE HE HE Im the one questioning
Phillip Cwazibe,"@ Danie Nilsen ​ it mean ""grows from the soil""" "@ Gee Peex1 it Mohuma mobung. I am Zulu but if wrong @ Pastor J ​ the intention was excellent though it now seems as if was in fact a disguise of a nefarious agenda. @ Danie Nilsen ​ mense ook. @ Danie Nilsen I worked a full 5 years in community development. The poor people on the ground get misled and robbed off their projects because of poor education. @ Gee Peex1 I think this gentleman is trying to say that the illegal landing of the Gupta landing brought to light the illicit involvement of the Guptas in the Estina matter. @ Gee Peex1 ​ I am with you.
Sthakathi Khumalo,Zwane will get away here lOLS... THABETHE IS ASSISTING HAHA "Leave Zulus are alone Shots fired hehe Obviously he wont find anything...

Eliot Chauke,Today the Evidence Leader is active... Big ups to The African Sister...
Mollo Booi,Zondo is now no longer standing on neutral ground. why would treasury quote the article if the article did not have influence on their decision for withdrawal?

Apex Orbit,That's exactly what a spy would say. Mr Magashule should be invited or rather volunteer to appear at the inquiry Cyril is letting due processes play out. He did say he will come to the inquiry if invited.
Teddy Chilima,enjoying the interview like on the interrogation panel i miss it
Solomon Ndubane,Adv Gcabashe is my best evidence leader. "Chair Zondo is ageing very fast now

Donald Mokwakwa,"""hit the dog till the owner comes out!!"
Shasha Mofokeng,Mr Thabethe got mixed up with the wrong crowd and now he is in a position of be eaten by crocodiles or lions. he must just tell the truth and seek to be protected simple now he is busy going in circles trying to protect the people that got him into trouble
Bruno Kgongwana,he was on the table then but now he is on the menu
Jabulile Mazwane,Really Kevin Davis difficult question
Themba Ntshingila,all cats are animals therefore all animals are cats Kevin ..

Solly 12,Zulus are not homogeneous in their thinking Uza kuyithetha inyaniso Thabethe kwedini kuyanyiwa India is milking buffaloes more than cattle

goldrick mafologela,A rescue mission in progress

Wildthing,now they will need to investigate the fish business and the cost going through it. 1 billion 300 thousand live in India. and Rat eating is done in the countryside. population could have grown even more. but note India has the top ten growing cities in the world. hard workers.
