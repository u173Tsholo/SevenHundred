Sindiswa Moolman,where is everybody? Do we have sound here or am I deaf? Thank you..the sound is on now Had to have my earphones on to hear @Antonio Joao Maiela Nhambirre Manyi who carried out the instruction Maseko refused to is here. She is holding the post Maseko was fired from 7 years ago @The Consigliere Long service with GCIS... He is an interested party today because he was implicated yesterday@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU. Hope he will give testimony later in this inquiry She is a Communicator by profession @Johan Le Grange. These people can talk and not communicate. She is Adv Kate Hoffmeyer @Mr.V I have noticed that female witnesses are led by female evidence leaders and men witnesses by males. A person trained to Communicate a message or information@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Mentor was led by a black adv lady...Adv Sello @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I agree @Thando Nkutha. I am liking her. All we need in the public service @peter pott Manyi must explain how he was appointed in that position. "Mr Maseko was transferred and not appointed Not public works @zama khumalo ...public service Where was Mr Manyi before going to the GCIS @zama khumalo? Thanks @makhosi nobhatyi But cabinet must approve such appointment @zama khumalo "That we dont know Yes @zama khumalo and @Thando Nkutha No @michael mbatha cabinet approves appointments of DGs. Their appointments are then published on Government Communication newsletter. Go an Google that. Its only Ministers are appointed by the Pres. "Hayi @Thando Nkutha In your young-self life @Thando Nkutha "@Vukile Racaza. Manyi carried out the instructions Maseko refused to. I remember At the end... after all is said about him. He will need to answer on all what was said @Soulma_n Soulma_n He will be dragged...@Thando Nkutha. "I think thats why he is here today Its your right @Joseph Thobejane We need ARVs to make the virus undetectable @Marvel Mushavhela Poor Zweli Momeka. Now he has to come and defend himself for carrying out instructions from above. Intimidation... R55m @Legae Nyalungu This woman deserves to hold this position on a permanent basis. She has proved her competency and integrity. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Have you just Googled? This inquiry has taught me to keep records of all engagements with superiors. These may come handy in situations like this. A big set up @Thando Nkutha. A manufactured evidence to fire her. Honourable Muthambi...Mhmmmm Who was fired by uBaba @makhosi nobhatyi? Shes still acting...which is sooo unfair to act for this long in the same position. Shame... Manyi has just tweeted explaining himself on the message he sent to Pumla. Kubani @T G Swartlane? To some of us... thats a lot of money. Muthambi wanted frustrate her while she is using her competencies and expertise. No @Orefile Macheoane. Muthambi became Minister of GCIS after his time there. Yes... she was put there strategically @Marvel Mushavhela She is watching @Orefile Macheoane with her lawyers @Orefile Macheoane I hope so too @Thokwane Dithuge That Muthambi was arrogant. I am not surprised she decided not to avail herself for the PSC meeting. They must give her her money....Tyhini!!! So Joel saw the damage already in 2009 @Thokwane Dithuge? Jimmy is going to jail for prejudicing the Inquiry. He prejudiced the Commission by sending a message to a witness while on stand Hahaha...@Orefile Macheoane.

Merle ORyan,and those greedy to have it
John Tleane,lets here the other side of the story which no one has in the inside of things at government level vs business before we can judge anyone
Peet Venter,"Zuma was bribed by the Guptas and when they got greedier Zuma could not escape but also benefiting from all the ""proceeds""." Maseko did say February... it's a cultural thing "Thando "Thando "Vukile I missed it. What is serious? "thx "@Ewald Jim is in the jam.
Lorna Kavanagh,money laundering yes always the poor suffer well said Nick. "Sa is a colony of Dubai serious indeed... Bullying now. he took over from Maseko when he resigned because of the Guptas. Definitely Sindiswa Mentor was very nervous due to security. Mrs Williams has a strong personality and would not bow to Guptaism. ....or should i say Guptagate. .... Definitely corruption prior to 1994.
john john,At the end of the Day the Mob Rules and there ain't anything we can do about it.... Just another hearing which will end up a waste of time and tax payers money..... "Agree Lorna South Africa needs young leaders of all races with vision & a purpose to achieve in order to move us forward.

She doesnt need security like Mrs Mentor. #straightshooters Can we all make offering after this broadcast so i can take her out for coffee in Saxonworld. At least we still have people who are trying to do right She doesnt strike me as the type that needs security. Hers was not a mission to make friends but to get the job done right. and hence they were trying to get rid of her. Faith Muthambi was trying to influence GCIS. ae eish this lady is too thorough. She must have been frustrating for our former president and Ms Muthambi to deal with. i mean who asks for things in black and white nowadays. Its a pity that we had to wait till friday to have our money's worth you cant get rid of such people easily. @Thando Nkutha what did you learn yesterday? haha trapa fasa baba lets...
