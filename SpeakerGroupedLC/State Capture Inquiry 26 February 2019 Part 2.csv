Desmond Masilela,"Are you guys still on lunch?""" We are not talking about race or what so ever here. The discussion is about Eskom I'm about to block 1 guy here. Wait you will see who might be. So what???? Before "Lets not ignore them @Christian W. Block. Fourie is blocked i'm glad im not gonna see his comment. Wow!!!! bomb shell
Mfundo Veerasamy,are we live again?
martin mupunga,yes dear
Robert Maleke Motala,i wonder
Eugene,lunch? I don't have lunch I don't even have a job. I'm white maybe they should stand at a free hot spot like I am and who might that be? I am unemployed because I am white it's true atleast I'm entertaining you and who protects the Caucasian? It's not my mosquitos I just know about the plan and I'm willing to share 1 mosquito kills 1 person in 1 hour. they can't kill more then 1 These are not normal mosquitoes. They are locked away the people walkes through 5 sealed rooms to get to them I know they are going to release the killer mosquitoes in South of Europe and send them to the north side in 2050 that would actually be the 3rd launch of the killer mosquitoes. The mosquitoes lay egs inside of the human body they can produce like a 100 000 mosquitoes per person. They don't need water like othe mosquitoes to breed So if you see someone who died of a killer mosquitoe it's best to leave the body and just run because you might be next does anyone want to see some racist emoji's? BEE and Affirmative action is why I am unemployed. We are also the only country that has affirmative action for the majority of the country. BEE is not there to empower blacks economically but to destroy white economics it's really backwards thinking. The dumb ones would be highly intelligent compared to the smart people in South Africa.
Joel Mzayidume,@Eugene Fourie at least you have wifi. many more unemployed blacks are unemployed...what's your problem "@Eugene Fourie regardless ok. so what. you're boring @Fils de l'homme pls go to Orania where you're welcome koko has a lot of explaining to do

Christian W,Guys block the trolls its the same troll accounts back again "Fils always goes on about bantus just ignore the trolls they are paid to distract us they are also paid to frame a fake naritive @Desmond Masilela block or ignore "@Thando Nkutha yes but they decided to become corrupt "@Thando Nkutha that is where the judges need to decide hopefully the tribunal will speed that up @makhosi nobhatyi where does the whites come into play here? you are just race baiting I agree that they are a embarrassment for black people black people should be outraged as there people represent them and thus should be shining examples of excellence there are such amazing black people but these corrupt people make their name bad What is interesting with watching so many of these inquiries is the body language of people who appear sincere and honest vs those with hidden agendas and who are clearly dishonest "@Pheladi Lamola I can understand that @makhosi nobhatyi ok "@Thando Nkutha i read it ""properly"" my interpretation was just out." "zuma said once that ""this corruption is a western thing"" I think that what he said is that he does not accept the western definition of the word." "He was referring to ""the african way"" which is that you need to pay me to do what you need me to do even if it is my job."
Robert Russell,@Eugene Fourie ....go have another joint... @Smod Zid ..... he is as high as a Hawk.....

Dabula Bongile,ziyawala!!!
Andre Gerber,@Thando acting general manager primary energy div Koko is quiet today. just defending yesterdays allegations @ Sthakathi Khumalo They cooked the books and lied. Eskom was basically bankrupt since 2015 As a South African I would not say embarrassment foe black people but embarrassment for South Africans Yes Derek all must think hard before their X Commissions are here to figure out the amount and who is responsible then only the law steps in
Pheladi Lamola,Do the people who do the testing receive the samples from the mines or do they go themselves to get them personally? "Wow We are outraged @Christian W but our voices are not heard because we're not politically connected.
Born free,Koko has a coconut for a brain.
welton paulse,Guys in ESKOM operated like a MAFIA
Israel Guambe,"its disappointing for S
Felix Muyoba,@welton paulse true..it was a playground for thieves @rohan barnard a technologist by profession.. @Lwandile Radebe they took us for granted..that we are stupid and we will not detect their deception..they were wrong!! "@Sthakathi Khumalo how can you call a thief clever
sikhumbuzo crispen sibanda,@Joel Mzayidume he dosent need to explain but simple go to jail @Lwandile Radebe l suggest prison exchange programmes with Zimbabwe for him to go to a prison called Chikurubi @Derek Main with straight facesü§£ü§£ü§£
Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Yeah - ask him that and then put him in the other one @Pheladi Lamola The time for playing with these criminals is over. We should do what they do in Saudi Arabia to thieves and chop off a hand @Sthakathi Khumalo They will not confirm these allegations - they will lie through their teeth as they always have @Sthakathi Khumalo What do these people testifying against the looters have to gain - nothing. Whereas the looters have every reason to lie "@Sthakathi Khumalo That's because these thieves messed up Eskom so much @Jane .Blamire Another way we can start to fix this mess is to vote wisely in May @Lwandile Radebe Because for the ANC it's always been about self-enrichment and stuff the people @Sthakathi Khumalo We need IPPs - it's the only way forward
John-Basel Ioannou,"the problem for koko is that he can't lie under pressure he stutters a lot koko will be easy pickings "because of koko this adv is giving facts with confirmation "there's another reason y so theoretically the guptas caused load shedding "anne.m I heard for every stage it the equivalent of a billion per stage.eg stage 2 =R2billion
makhosi nobhatyi,Where is masutha and cele please send arrests @ Thando Nkutha üòÉüòÉüòÄüòÄ hey you have a point "They are all busy now figured out what they are going to say "@Thando Nkutha an educated man ruined graduates and destroying them by putting money There is no way we should blame whites we have authority to change South Africa but our leadership were busy enriching themselves ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è "@Christian w my apologies I was trying to reveal something here these people who are implicated here always come to media criticize whites knowing that they are beneficiaries  "@Thando Nkutha President appointed another arm of investigators to investigate funds we lost It is Gupta did load shedding
Anne M.,@Thando Nkutha üòÇ @rohan barnard Acting General Manager of one of the divisions at Eskom "@Thando Nkutha With such a high unemployment rate in South Africa @Derek Main Or develop amnesia when they come before the commission "@Sthakathi Khumalo The commission investigators have checked all the affidavits "@John-Basel Ioannou Yes
Lwandile Radebe,koko strait to jail please no wonder Guptas ran away...... they were milking our country.... mara why anc sold us out
rohan barnard,SGS- Sibeko Gold Systems üòÇüòÇüòÇ Who is the witness? Thanks @Anne M. & @Felix Muyoba
Sthakathi Khumalo,"The danger into accepting one version of a testimony is that you may miss the relevance of the other!! Until Koko v Which make it difficult for me to accept this one version as the truth.. I want people in the field or central to give me evidence/corroborate as opposed to theories So in your views people which version should we take? and if so why? "Anne M. Compromising as they are these emails "Andre Gerber I hear you "The Eskom saga for me Felix Muyoba- I hear he is a clever black.. and Derek Main 40 year contracts are just capture at its highest points. If they are kept they must be given one year contracts haha
