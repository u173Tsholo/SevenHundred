Mart Barkhuizen,Can something not be done about these idiots who are writing these purile comments?
Kopz Koape,There are corrupt DA members but i hardly know any that are appearing before the State capture commission The TRC was a joke.. There was no justice at all @SanFran Arnold..When does the commission finish??? @Naledi Barron..Yes some families got closure but families like the Biko family wanted justice after the police men confessed to the murder..So many other families still want justice @SanFran Arnold..Thats a relief.. Thanks for the info @Naledi Barron..But they will never get it unfortunately.. @Naledi Barron. Indeed. Biko was a great man and a martyr who died for his people..He would be turning in his grave seeing the level of corruption in this country..Same goes for Hani @Wim lou yes he would..ANC was corrupt even during the apartheid era..Read chris hani biography..Also so many ex cadres stated how corrupt ANC was during exile in other African states @Naledi Barron .I agree 100%..Change starts with the youth i guess @Naledi Barron..The problem is many of our elders dont want to tell us the history because they want us to move on and not be vindictive @Naledi Barron.. Absolutely "Juju says Ramaphosa is a ""rented"" president.." @Naledi its the same in Australia. its day light saving at the end of October its one hour forward @Naledi Barron..Lol ok "@Naledi Barron .Im aware that the cost of living is very high in. the uk..For example @Naledi..Besides the cost of living i hear that crime is rising especially in Birmingham and London..I hear that there are alot of Pakistani and Jamaican gangs roaming the streets @Naledi barron thats worriesome..By the way is it true that Brixton has been gentrified..It was a predominantly Jamaican and Carribbean area Adjournment time Hmmm no sound??? @Naledi Barron..Oh i see.. Actually speaking of break i need a lunch break..Im going to eat chisa nyama..I eat ut at least 4 times a week @Naledi Barron..10mins for??? @Naledi Barron ok Eskom has some serious issues Apparently one of the gupta brothers fled to Australia and ventured into the mining business in Australia @Naledi Barron.. It's the truth..Ill try find the name of the Gupta brother..It seems like its a big family and they are all into business @Naledi Barron..The Gupta brother in Australia is Rajesh Gupta and his company is Adani mines and it has been involved in many scandals apparently @Naledi Barron..No problem @Cassim..No problem.. Alhamdulillah If certain ministers within the Anc didn't blow the whistle then the Gupta's would likely still be in South Africa running the country @Cassim but the media got the inside info from Anc whitsle blowers i never thought Herman Mashaba would leave the DA and form his own party.. Considering his history he is untrustworthy.. Strange that public protector cleared Ace of any wrongdoing in the free state case.. @SanFran Arnold..Oh ok @SanFran Arnold. I wonder why Malema is defending her now when before he said she is incompetent..Whats going on??? @SanFran Arnold. That makes perfect sense.. That is a logical way to look at it What happened to Ramaphosa s plan to privatise eskom?? "I don't think it will work Mr Tsotsi..The name speaks for its self..It speaks volumes 😎 I heard that one before🙄🙄 @Andre..How could Zumas salary be r2.89 pa? @Andre correction you mean r2.89millon..Thats more like it @LB..Its r.2.89 m. pa..The calculator is your friens @LB. However it's seems you and Andre are at war with Mathematics Long live AZAPO✊ @Fuzile..Ike Khumalo is that you??? SA is in the same boat as Lesotho now SA is slowly becoming a failed state @SanFran Arnold. Lesotho is a failed state and it has been for some time..SA is heading there if major changes dont happen NOW @San Fran Arnold..The answer to that question is obvious.. EFF has no clear plan to fight crime and to solve the electricity crisis..Its a joke "Malema wishes to open SAs borders and make Africa one he is dreaming.Botswana Its a shame that Zuma still has some support in KZN..It makes you wonder Yawn😴
Sbusiso Dlomo,it's too late Dolly
Jason Wabanie,Joh Miss Klein Dont play yourself madam.. Eina...Hoe nou gemaak Miss Klein?
Mzalwane Mzala,The conviction of the CFO of VBS and his becoming a state witness must cause sleepless nights to all wrongdoers in that bank. @Zicelo Sokhela Others will stick it out. 'Mashela Oko' was trusted by the Guptas The Gupta board R12 The ANC elected its leader and 57% of those who voted chose the ANC and its President to lead the country. It is a lie that the ANC forced Ramaphosa on us. Since 2007 the constitution of the ANC says the party president will be its candidate for state presidency. The ANC is an organisation of around 1 Million members. @Lex Luger You are correct I agree @Lex Luger I hate corruption but only people who were never victims of apartheid can claim that apartheid is less harmful than corruption. Unfortunately I experienced both. Corrupt people must go to jail What I know is that corrupt people don't care about ideology and politics. They use these to cover their thieving. "President Ramaphosa did well by changing the leadership in Crime Intelligence In 2018 the president was entitled to 3.6 Million and he committed to donate half to an NGO Thanks @Anne M. Corruption can not be justified by pointing at what happened under apartheid. Looters must go to prison Is there a medical doctor who cannot count? The ANC has called for corrupt people to be isolated ANC was formed in 1912 and apartheid became an official system in 1948 @SanFran Arnold The KZN province blundered and the public reaction to that led to stronger resolutions that the NEC took. "Gossip cannot be a reason for firing people. I support the position that if you are charged @SanFran Arnold No one has said the ANC is perfect. I am saying whatever it is there is no alternative to the ANC or you would have told me of it. @SanFran Arnold Be honest and admit that the parties in your coalition are also not perfect @Sekgololo Johannes Law enforcement agencies must charge regardless of noise from from fans @SanFran Arnold Please be realistic as I have studied politics and governance. There can be no removing the ANC if you do not count the numbers of the DA and the EFF as a starting point. Anyone who hates the EFF can only dream about a coalition that can unseat the ANC. Anyone who refuses to work with the DA is being childish if they believe there can be a coalition that can unseat the ANC. Stop talking about parties that get less thalictrae support 1% Forget about small parties that get less than 1% electoral support if you can not get the DA and the EFF in the room to discuss coalition. The first person to be convicted in the VBS case is white so there is no credence to the argument that only black people are investigated or charged for corruption. Jail corrupt people! @Xolani J Masemula Lol I am a realist This lady is a CA if I recall well.

DCJ right to say that can't be a valid excuse @phakamile I think it's AC/DC @sammy I think the AFU attachment order puts any possible sale on ice until the criminal case is over I wonder if the innocent people whose careers and lives were destroyed in the capture of Eskom cannot file damages claims against Eskom? what are the rules around destruction of documents at Eskom? "@roz I agree. is this not tantamount to ""defeating the ends of justice""?" @sekgame spot on.
