South Africa is stuffed because race plays a big part when ever a white person is appointed to a high position there is a hugh outcry from black people There was aCEO appointed and there was a hugh outcry @ Thando Nkutha CEO at DENEL @ Thando Nkutha RACISM @Thando Nkutha there is a outcry because he is white.Maybe we need more educated people running the Public sector Like i said before when the country colapse don't cry refugee and run to europeen countries @ Thando Nkutha IT'S IN THERE GENES TO LOOT AND STEEL.lOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A TRUCK OVERTURNS .wHO IS LOOTING No i'm not.Its all over social media .Check who is looting @ Sandile Khowane like i said it's in their genes Look at Africa and tell me who is looting @ Thando Nkutha i have travelled Africa and has seen a lot.

It's facts No it's not it is all true .Go and google and you will see the facts @ Khumbuzile Khumalo it's in your face .You cannot ignore it well if the truth is racist then yes Those whites are part of the cadres. And must be dealt with Sorry if i sounded racist but there are big problems with our black communtities. They will have to deal with it because it is destroying South Africa
Coco,@ Walter Du Plessis it is madness I know This needs to be fixed. People have to boycot ANC just like they boycoted Zuma Most Anc voters dont understand these things its through mobilisation they will understand last chance? its been 25 yrs dude so the country must collapsed completely before reaction from the voters? how about showing them now that this is unacceptable and bring them back later It is really ieeational and irresponsible honestly so is that not enough to show them that you are not stupid @ Makhosi Bhayi "it is not true "could we please not entertain race here Nobody in their rigght mind will vote for ANC full stop @ Makhosi he was protected by the whole ANC cocus including the present president so what does that tell you @ Walter as much as it is painful to accept this but i have to accept it/. We are dealing with selfish dogs The majority of people are so used to poverty they dont even know they deserve better that is why they keep voting for these mafias who are incapable and incompetent can we please stay away from race please @ Brigdette nothing is going to happen trust me. Who has been at least suspended in the light of all this masness? just onr? "CR is in the same gravy train CR is still ANC and has been for 25 yrs No enlightened and mentally stable being will vote for ANC. Period! Which McKenzie they are talking about? is that coloured guy? you are correct @ Andre Did you know that Leshabane Papa an ececutive of Bosasa is friends with Zizi Kodwa... best friends buddy? @ Walter please lets not talk racism today Racism is not what most people understand it to be. it is far deeper than that hi and welcome @ Rohan "@ Walter "@ Rohan @ Walter its not in the genes but in social structrues of this world thank you @ Rohan I have been asking people to stop with race You are correct since the 1700s then you must find out why? @ Walter @ Walter that is why our saying racism is not what most people understand it to be it is far deeper than that Really? @ Walter? "There is no truth in your statements hi and welcome @ cheryl Go and also google how racism was structured against blacks in the whole world by white supremacists @ Val. that is a lie. Racism was structured and black people can only hate the process but cannot do anything about it so just stop with stupid ranting Please... back to the inqiry My BP is up...

welton paulse,"mara Jirre
Joel Mzayidume,only irrational voters would vote for ANC after so many years of looting. our country is going the direction of the rest of Africa with so many corrupt grandpas and grandmas in parliament @Bridgette Kekana 80% of that Cabinet is Ramaphosa's Cabinet today @Bridgette Kekana when? CR is a public relations man...pretending to be different but really cut from the same ANC cloth look at the Jabu Mabuza guy now...he maintains 30% of Eskom boilers...the rot continues under CR CR never attended Mandela's inauguration. Why? @Sandile Khowane kufana konke lokhu kwamakhehla nezalukazi. aba voetseke ngikhathele! "@Mzalwane Mzala meanwhile @makhosi nobhatyi what procedure does he need to follow to fire corrupt ministers? please tell us Vote for who you like @Lungisani Ntshonga . I'm tired of voting for perpetual promises I'm amazed at people who have access to information continuing to vote for crooks. after 25 years. I forgive peasants who have little access to information. @Walter Du Plessis you are now defecating through your mind @Walter Du Plessis i can't believe you can be so ignorant Matshela Koko has some explaining to do...i can't wait for him to appear before Zondo @Thando Nkutha It doesn't matter Zondo will call him and Adv Maleka will grill him @peter pott forensics can investigate that claim Loadshedding is due to incompetence at the top of Eskom. no other credible story @peter pott you're right. none of the current board know anything about power generation @Sfiso Nguza you're right @Thando Nkutha loadshedding began 2008. where were the Guptas then? Did someone say Zondo subpoenad Koko already? @Bridgette Kekana it's worth waiting for his testimony. Prejudging him will not help you. "Is it conclusive that ""the businessman"" is Salim Essa?" Adv Pretorius is back...Agrizzi's man @rohan barnard confirmed by whom? @Thando Nkutha ok thanks. Did someone say he's only coming next month (i hope next week)? ok thanks @Thando Nkutha O Brian Molefe as well? Yo kshubile @James Godloza Godloza Mabuza has said it in public that he is not competent to deal with loadshedding so I'm not sure where your argument is coming from. ok i get it @James Godloza Godloza . i also agree true @Makwa Choma @Makwa Choma this chap is playing leave him. @Mzalwane Mzala thinks we were born yesterday. to vote ANC after so many years of corruption would be sick McKinsey's reputation is in the toilet
Mathevula Stamen,we are going into right direction now. the fact that this commission it is opening our eyes most of criminals they will afraid now to loot for our government lets wait for the recommendations from this commission after they are done let the commission give us more looters
Dmitry Nikashin,"i heard from a black gardener the other day that the ANC steals so much so that when the whites take over ‚úä‚úäüèª‚úäüèº‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèæ‚úäüèø you can be proud of yourself no matter what colour you are ...just don't be corrupt!!!! Cashkom ... their personal ATM ... lol
Nelson Musoliwa,Hope Tribunal established by the president will expeditiously and swiftly act within constitutional nd any legislative framework to redeem our economic and social position. Khumbuzile is right race issue is so irrelevant here Le Raux SA need people to manage it purposefully for development no matter who the president is; race can not define and shape our destiny. Le Roux i am happy that there are people like u lets canvass this as wide as possible to keep SA cohesive for the benefit of all SAns. "Mzala i agree with you he is trying to redeem the country from shambles
Benny Bala,I still have no trust on the ANC. Betrayal of the TRUST.
Darren Danield,zondo commision is doing well to expose the wrong doing but we some serious bite with the bark
Paul Mufhadi,The ANC corrupted the whole country through cadre deployment. They're not to be trusted. Giving ANC the chance is suicide. Everything is expensive due to the looting by ANC CR knew what was happening and He did nothing !!!! CR was part of preparing the constitution and when Zuma broke the constitution he defended Zuma. Now south Africans must him another chance? a big NO!!
Emma Gcee,African leaders are all the same our major problems in Africa are our youth who refused to do the right thing Africans prefer suffering and smiling our leader's don't care about the masses
Musa Bakiti,ANC needs Jesus not votes This guys are clever .One day we will hear that Zondo commission was another means of getting money of government corupt means.South Africa open your eyes
Dieter Myburgh,i think all ministers and deputies must be fired and new ones must be appointed. @Joel - the guptas were working through Salim isa the guptas were background singer for many years... laying down the law for zuma Ewald Kruge he could not come forward then - he had alot of info to collect and more important collecting evidence Teboho..what does that eeeeee mean?
Des,@ Walter Du Plessis It is governed by Idiots and Greed who are not worthy to be rulers. Most importantly not forgetting western interference @ Bridget Kekana CR is the worst of them all. Wait until his crimes surfaces

Rosemary Fourie,yes so very true
Segongwane Doctor,Our leaders dont care about us. What they say needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. The BEE needs a bottom up approach.
Diwi The Doer,Some people believe it's okay to be poor on earth. They anticipate better life in heaven.
Kirk gemmell,As well a BBE is meant to correct and balance business - it is the root cause of the countries corruption it‚Äôs so evident on the Tenderpreneurs ! Thando - it‚Äôs not western it‚Äôs Eastern China all over Africa ? Thando you should care ? If you mine minerals you have to sell them globally ? Why is that looting ? Think about it Thando you made a bias comment about Westerners looting Africa - I just corrected your perspective - glad. You are here for the right reasons as all of us are Rock solid Mr Mabuza thanks
Samkelo Zwide,Zondo Commission got security surveillance from BOSASA company..
Mzalwane Mzala,President Ramaphosa is doing a lot to fix South Africa Cyril removed the controversial head of SARS Cyril is capacitating the criminal justice system Cyril ensured that the post of the head of Hawks have been filled "After many years without leadership in criminal intelligence President Ramaphosa has suspended people who are accused of corruption in the NPA. President Ramaphosa has established an inquiry into the fitness of two top NPA leaders who are alleged to have acted wrongly. President Ramaphosa is making sure that no SIU report is not acted on for 10 years after it recommended prosecutions like it happened in the case of Bosasa. "President Ramaphosa has set up a special tribunal to adjudicate in these corruption cases. Quick @Joel Mzayidume She still have to attend the commision The likely person to have leaked NPA documents to Bosasa was suspended last week Thanks for the cleanup president Ramaphosa "President Cyril Ramaphosa has in terms of Section (2)(1) of the Special Investigating Units and Special Tribunals Act 74 of 1996 The establishment of this Special Tribunal is occasioned by the need to fast-track the finalisation of matters that the SIU refers for civil litigation following conclusion of their investigations. These are matters where the SIU would have referred to civil litigation contracts entered into by state institutions to be declared irregularly invalid or set aside. Fast-tracking these matters will enable the SIU to recover monies and or assets lost by state institutions through irregular and corrupt means. "It will The Special tribunal It is meant to avoid the lengthy court cases The litigation process includes both public and private sectors persons and entities. @Sendo Sityebi The majority of South African voters are probably 'idiots'. Be careful of isnults insults The powers and functions of the Special Tribunal are to adjudicate upon any civil proceedings brought before it by a (SIU) in its own emanating from the investigation by such SIU. Such civil proceedings will be based on the outcomes from the investigations by SIU. @Talloolah Moon The investigation is done by the SIU just like in the Bosasa matter where the SIU in 2009 already but the NPA did not prosecute until 2019. This changes that It is quicker as opposed to what is happend with Bosasa We will no more have a situation where SIU investigations are frustrated like in the case of Bosasa The special tribunal have been set up. "The President has We are not talking hope but action! "President Ramaphosa has also appointed the following judges as additional members 1. Judge Icantharuby Pillay 2. Judge Johannes Eksteen 3. Judge Selewe Peter Mothle 4. Judge Lebogang Modiba 5. Judge Thina Siwendu 6. Judge David van Zyl and 7. Judge Sirajudien Desai @Talloolah Moon Criminals will always try to defeat the system but that does not mean we should not act the SIU have already investigated many matters but there has been no prosecution. The special tribunal addresses that. President Ramaphosa is fixing the criminal justice system "President Ramaphosa has appointed a credible head of the NPA "Before Ramaphosa's appointment of Batohi "National Director of Public Prosecutions Fixing the country! @Myka'Al Daud Are you now EFF again? President CyrilRamaphosa to open over US$1 billion investment zinc mine Northern Cape What bil? No People who have traveled and studied economies of other countries would know that investment that create jobs is valued by government. Zinc mines are labour intensive Not even one country in the world is against foreign direct investement. Susan Daniels is viewed as both a whistle-blower and an enabler of Gupta corruption in Eskom. Its complicated That could be the case @Anne M. The media ran a campaign to portray Susan daniels as a whistle-blower that was being victimized through disciplinary processes at Eskom. @Sandile Khowane Who said there is no regulation of FDIs in South Africa? @Sandile Khowane Protection of Investment Act 2015 Foreign Investment Bill 2017 "@Sandile Khowane It is a government Act that adresses amon others Since when is treasury not government? @Sandile Khowane ? "The Act calls for promotion and preservation of cultural heritage @Magda Seguin and @Gerald Sono Other people will never admit to not knowing Those who have worked in local government know that they do not pass legislation but observe and implements all legislation. @Magda Seguin It is indeed legal 101. www dot gov dot za explains further about The Protection of Investment Act of 2015 @Sandile Khowane Please open that Act and see that it states under definitions '‚Äò‚ÄòDepartment‚Äô‚Äô means the Department responsible for trade and industry;' @Sandile Khowane under definitions '‚Äò‚ÄòMinister‚Äô‚Äô means the Minister responsible for trade and industry;' @Sandile Khowane You have never seen this legislation.
Dilip Badal,Brigette Kekana .. CR is cut from the same cloth.. as he knew all along the wrong doing in the ANC.. but remained quiet... Corrupt as all @Mzalwane Mzala .. what does that make CR ??/ a saint Crap... @Mzalwane Mzala ..you missed out the in... @Solly Mothabela ... you on the money.. well done
Solly Mothabela,"CR was forced by court judgments to do what he is doing. Let us thank civil society groupings The fear of losing elections is the only thing that spurred the ANC into doing what is right. For years they have been sitting on the rot.Go ask Dr Makhosi Khoza.
Lungisani Ntshonga,@ makhosi nobhatyi i‚Äôagree with you waiting for a right time "@Sandile khowane I think Nobatyi has answered thi CR17 at that time he was a deputy pres
Andre Gerber,"CR has now establish a special unit so implicated persons can go to jail yes but to rescue ANC before elections "to recover the money and seize assets makes them guilty "Koko had lots to say with his first hearing outlined Is Zizi not here today? he is only mentioning Koko because the new board suspended him. he was the only 1 the new board suspended he has declared his wife's son is involved in mining and he does not sit on meetings that involve coal it' not his blood relative although he has brought him up as his own why did eskom not buy the mines. At least they would have saved money "true greedy ANC EFF ..... VBS was a mistake? THe ANC also to blame for covering for them SO ANC can say ... It all was a mistake YIP SENDO Till elections Jesus came and left when he saw what the ANC did @Mzalwane Mzala tooooooo lateeeee waiting for the new whistle-blower yes Thando I ripped out the security system at my ouse i ripped out the security system at my house..... hoisted the old SA flag....... playing De La Rey loud on my music system...... now i feel safe.

Magda Seguin,He is be g questioned in what he found not what he did The evidence is not given in a vacuum...there are affidavits produced by them before testifying Judge Zondo explained last week that they are dealing with the gaps of the portfolio committee hearings Evidence is led from the affidavits produced by the people being questioned ESKOM was already bankrupt in 2015...this man could not have done a miracle I a few months to turn it around.The damage was already done and escalated to the billions of debt it has now He explained what he found last week...ESKOM was already in fast deline *decline @Mzalwane Mzala Yes "@Bridgette Kekana..Denel The Daily Maverick published all the Gupta emails...the two whustleblowers who did the expeet cyber investigation are now in hiding fearing for their lives @Gerald Sono I fully agree..sometimes I wonder why people use this platform for other purposes than what is being said in the testimonies @Than do Nkutha I was merely explaing to people who have no inkling of these procedures and don't follow to be able to discern and make informed comments.I rest my case.Goodbye. @Sandile even Batsesane Kumalo owns a mine among many other blacks...dont spread lies She owns a diamond mine in the Northern Cape Bridgette Radebe...Min.Radebe's wife also iwns mines Ben Ngubane fully implicated with evidence in his own words @ Sandile you are nit picking as it does not suit your agenda @Sandile you stated that only whites fet mining licences....its not true @Mzalwane Mzala Discernment and not getting on the propoganda bandwagon by some political parties essential....people are being duped by populist rhetoric No legislation stands in isolation...that is legal101 Thank you @Mzalwane Mzala Just blocked Sandile...no use arguing with someone who is stuck @Gerald Sono true Medupecabd Kulisile
