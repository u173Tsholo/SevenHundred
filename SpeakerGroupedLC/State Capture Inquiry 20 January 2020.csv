Robert Russell,They all learned from their thief Zuma Madam.... your clients have delayed their court cases for 10 years..... this commission ends at the end of THIS year.... so this witness will never give evidence.. nice strategy..... DJC Zondo........ you do not need to justify anything to the crooks lawyers Madam...facts are facts... lies are lies..... how do you change the facts??????? it makes no difference when the truth is told...... Oh yes.... I forgot... you tell lies on behalf of your clients 3 MINUTES Thank DJC @Elvis Malakoane and that's why Namibia kicked their version of BEE to touch..... BEE does not help the people it is intended to help... Chris... blocled blocked Back to school ....LOL!!!! @Amelia Mampane ..... NEVER
C'ben Mutumba,Am from Namibia but i like how south Africa deals with inner problems
Smart Guys,our justice system is down the drain zondo Must put his foot down
Moleti Moseki,They hope the court extend the ZONDO commission üò¢üò¢üò¢.
Tebogo Khaas,Zondo mustn't grant this fanciful application. Waste of time. Commie of adjournments and postponements has adjourned till 11:30 Advocate Shezi is arguing a lost application. Wasting commission's time. Testing Zondo's patience.. Application dismissed. Rightly so. The commission of adjournments is on a sudden tea break.

Pastor J.J,Just get on with it and stop irritating us with another delay. 1.2.3 dismiss the application and lets get on with it. I have counted 1.2.3 and this nonsense has not been dismissed yet. It seems like the DCJ is ignoring me. hehehehehhe Where is Bianca today? few others are still MIA The Attorney spoke perfect english. Time for the DOOM "I want to see Zuma If she was my wife I would have killed myself a while back. @Elvis Malakoane ...Totally agree. It is becoming an unnecassary irritation and has nothing to do with the matter at hand. @Lorraine Naidoo South African Indian from Durban North. And offcourse a beeeeeeg skelm toooooooo @Eliot Chauke I rather die than vote for those skelms @Thulani Bukani ...Thats a poignant question. My personal view from experience is that the ANC is a brilliant organisation but unfortunately got populated by all the skelms. @Thulani Bukani ....We have reached that point 90% @Eliot Chauke .....The ANC when it was established and therafterwas lead by brilliant leaders. At some point it all went wrong. And we are seeing the results now. sadly so @Makwa Choma ....That is exactly the point i was making. @Jacob Zuma ....You got 2 words absolutely right.....DOG and LIE
Eagle,THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME Remove her now Finally someone who speaks english lol "South Africa is wasted
digitalemotionfilms,Your client is ventilated ?????? Is that even english ???? Perhaps she is ventilating ? SABC pls set your camera to progressive not interlased - the scanlines look terrible

Nkululeko Mdluli,Who is she representing? Who is the lady lawyer representing? Who is she representing? "But to be honest this lady has got a point "With the moves Zuma is making
Portia Mgweba,This commission is just waste of money and time best
Sboniso Sabelo,What's causing the whistle when Pretorius talks I wish I can see people like Julius Malema coming into this commission there's a lot we can hear
Noxolo Tshabangu,@sboniso sabelo Pretoria has what is called a lisp. That is what causes him to whistle when he pronounces certain vowels. Our president has the same affliction. ü§≠ @ Eagle we have to create our own hope... for our own future... The world as a whole is at a crossroads... countries are dealing with questions and issues that are uncomfortable. We are too.
Nkululeko Zondo,"I wonder what will our Leaders say in Davos about the state of Power to the investors "Is it me or

Kung Fu Kenny,@Yumna Thomas Hope Malema is next for prosecution and extreme racism. "@Stronger together Nothing new @Yumna Thomas Fighting for what? they already looted VBS. They are fighting to loot more. @Yumna Thomas It's because of DA/FF+ ect that Zuma is in his current situation. ANC/EFF protect him. @Yumna Thomas EFF will be worse than Zuma if they are ever in control. Ramapoes=Zuma's right hand man "@Yumna Thomas I can see you don't look at their alliances. EFF is still part of the ANC @Stronger together A few weeks ago i saw interviews like that about South Africa as well. South Africa will be worse than Zim. "@Yumna Thomas Yes it is @Yumna Thomas Afriforum literally has to pressure the NPA just to do their job. @Stronger together The rest of the world knows what's going on in South Africa but turns a blind eye. You can't fool all the people all the time. @Endinako Projects Do you believe what you read or hear from our Corrupted news sources of South Africa? proof is within the courts. Time to jail the looters and EFF VBS looters. "@Stronger together I know about him @Stronger together Pan Africanism is even within our politics in written word now lol. @Stronger together Pan Africanism = Black Supremacy Start already. @Yumna Thomas it's well documented. Xhosa and Zulu's killed our Indigenous Khoisan to near extinction. Then they sold their very own people as slaves to the Brits to sell to the U.S "@Stronger together Desmond Tutu said that himself. He said ""Black people lived better during apartheid than they do now in""" This lady talks with Emotions not with her Educational Background. @Wilson Hishono Land Issues happen because black people in South Africa reproduce 60 000 Children per year. That's called over population. @Wilson Hishono Especially those in poverty are hit harder after reproduction "@Wilson Hishono Reproduction isn't ""Fine"". On the scale of 60 000 per year (Statistics from HomeAffairs) it's called OverPopulation. With over population less jobs @Elvis Malakoane This is not an insult it's a fact. Growing 60 000 per year for a single race is over population especially in South Africa. @Wilson Hishono We're talking about South Africa and the real facts. Over population is the big problem when they have NO JOBS. 30 minute Tea breaks. Christ. "@Wilson Hishono No "@Wilson Hishono Go look at any over populated country. Poverty sits with those who create the most children on a yearly basis. When it comes to property @Wilson Hishono The same thing is going to happen in South Africa in a few years anyways. The rate of black/colored reproduction South Africa is very close to over population. @Stronger together They make more and more children to abuse the Grant System. @Ayanda Diliza It's called over population. Go look at the symptoms of a over populated country. Everything you mentioned falls under Overpopulation. @Ayanda Diliza How can you expect a country to grow when you elect the biggest criminals that loot the country in ANC/EFF? Medical Marijuana can provide BILLIONS of Jobs. They want black people to stay poor and full of hate to use them for political Gain. @Stronger together That's awesome üëç @Stronger together Not at the moment but i can make a account @Stronger together Have you seen previously expropriated farms are at a rate of 88% Non working and producing nothing. "@Stronger together üëçwill do @Stronger together I can stream 100% fine but download is super slow. I will sign up in the meanwhile for the account "@Ayanda Diliza They already tried it @johannes mailula Takes nearly 2 Million rand Per child to send them through school to grade 12 alone. People have no Common sense anymore. "@Norma Day No @Elvis Malakoane You do realize the current BEE law is racist towards all other races right? @Elvis Malakoane BEE is a racist law. @Elvis Malakoane You should not earn more because of skin color. "@Stronger together Cough Cough @Stronger together Our current problem is corruption and looting. The family members of politicians and friends. Have you seen Eskom has 60% more people working there than they need? @Ayanda Diliza BEE is a racist Law. It's racist towards any other race. "@Stronger together nearly 2 Million per year for each of those extra's @Jacqui Baumgardt üëç "@Stronger together Telegram is downloading @Elvis Malakoane BEE is the reason SOE's are failing. Including Eskom and SAA. @Makwa Choma Slow Motion? Inflation is at 7.5 and our GDP growth at 3.0. South Africa is going down fast. The Rand in 2020 is the worst performing currency thanks to looting and corruption. @Jacqui Baumgardt Our currency will be very weak one of these days. Below all the other third world countries. Our inflation is worse than many third world countries right now @Makwa Choma Restructuring in all areas. Remove BEE policy and hire people based on Experience and Qualifications. Raise the standard passing rate back to 50%.We need educated people working. @Stronger together I agree. They loot instead of spending it on their own people for housing and food/plumbing. They do this in many other countries when they want to eliminate a Ethnicity. "@Makwa Choma ok "@Makwa Choma We will never be able to remove them "@Stronger together Well Getting some ‚òï
Endinako Projects,Kenny u sound like you read the opposite of what is written or told in our daily news
Granny Mokwena,can we start chair? advocate Wentzel is very disorganised so the police missed all this paper trail? agg what police
Wilson Hishono,two centers of power only in africa "@Stronger together it was even in Namibia ...old people have/owned/acquired houses bt after demcracy /Indpndence sudenly prices skyrocketed now for a graduate to acquire both a proper house and proper car while in a democracy or independent is close to imposible @Kung Fu Kenny well reproducing is fine but equal distirbution of resources is the issue Race does not matter we talking about humanity here "@Kung Fu Kenny  "@Immanuel  @fuzile dazana HE is consulting i think there is not @Kung Fu Kenny south africa is not overpopulated go to Nigeria @Kung Fu Kenny youll know what overpopulation is @Ayanda Diliza THANK YOU
–û–¥–∏–Ω–æ–∫–∏–π –≤–æ–ª–∫,@Wilson... only one centre of power . Luthuli House. The rest is window dressing @makwa. FF PLUS is best bet for now. @makwa. The Afrikaner knows oppression dating back to 1795 when British took control of the Cape. The FFP leadership is fully aware of our collective challenges and offer workable non racist solutions @makwa. anc lite has more factions internally than parties in Parliament.

temwani kakwende,This commission and the tea breaks üò§
Ayanda Diliza,There is nothing excessive about South Africa's population growth rate. The problem is a lack of economic growth and infrastructure development to accommodate the growing population. In South Africa population growth are inversely related. During poor economic growth unemployment rises and the poor resort to having more babies to get government grants. The problem is not the principle of land re-distribution; but its poor and sometimes senseless implementation. @Kung Fu Kenny BEE is not a racist law. Racist laws are made on the principle of exclusion. BEE laws are based on the principle of inclusion of the previously excluded. "The ANC is destroying itself from within
Kevin,Kung Fu China has close to 2 Billion people with very few people not working. Those who do not work in China choose to do so. So why should that be a problem in SA If the country provides the environment for job creation...then there are jobs...easy as that "There is a huge problem on the way ... It's called MOTHER NATURE. She always finds a way to ""re-calibrate"" and ""adjust""" "There will be the mother of all ""super viruses"" one day to bring the balance back to nature...." She also annoys Zondo üòÇ

johannes mailula,most of people think if you have 5 children you chasing the grant of which is not true babies are our future SA will not be over populated in anyway the problem is we got back the land and we dont have money to buy equipment so what is the purpose for that whites are running the economy like or not "i am so tired off black boss they will under pay you they dont even worry about the labour law "guys 1 question why do we still have trade unions today  50million for birthday party only 7million short to give SA citizens 1million fat cheque per house hold the rich will be filthy rich and the poor will die this thing of our vote is secrete its killing us cause today we remain secret while the same party we voted for flashes our country down the drain. eeish!

Jacqui Baumgardt,Yebo Gogo is back referring to this 70-year old mama - namely me Zondo doesn't really work well with this evidence leader BEE should be called BFF - best friends forever @Kung Fu Kenny - agree maybe she learnt something last week about being more organised Business execs must run SOEs not cadres Wentzel is now very nervous I feel sorry for her can't be easy Engineer with a business degree chapest currency on the market at the mo sorry - finger problems!
