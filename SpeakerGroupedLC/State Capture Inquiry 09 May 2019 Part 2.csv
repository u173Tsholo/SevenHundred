Petrus Mthimkhulu,this commission is mathematically challenged it appears ü§£
Felix Muyoba,@Petrus Mthimkhulu true @watson mutanga true and i dont whay they are struggling about the witness is also confusing the chair 2 decimal places..that is simple then..69.98 will automatically be 70 @Lorna Kavanagh yeah but in that case there was no third digit no but then nobody can qualify..use your discretion that it should rather rounded to whole number.. @Lorna Kavanagh the one who used that criteria was wrong..he/she was suppoed to mean rounding to the whole number and not decimal digits @Lorna Kavanagh that was wrong or it is an exclusion tactic the authors of those regulations are incompetent the problem will be that those regulations can be challenged in a court of law and that will cost government more billions instead @Lorna Kavanagh but you are missing the point..the issue here is the whole number which should be the score and not decimal numbers.. "if you keep on hunting for the 3rd now i see..so brian was there when these confusing criteria were in place? "@Terencd Caldwell i mean that if regulation for tendering are not crafted properly @Ashney Chetty i agree with you @watson mutanga i understand it is the arrogance of mr molefe (brian) that motivated him to take that decision instead of using the legal opinion of the group.. "@watson mutanga true @Stephan Dolk leave our judge alone please i also dont understand what @Stephan Dolk is talking about the judge your mike dcj @Lloyd Langenhoven you guys are happy when anc wins because you know that what they were evangelising about land expropriation was just a rhetoric..it will be business as usual.. @makhosi nobhatyi yes @Lloyd Langenhoven can you guys refrain from this racial issues..they are pathetic! @Val Speirs can you focus on non racial issues please? "@Ben Cole yes..tell them (@Lloyd Langenhoven @Val Speirs yes but what will it help us? counsel mokoena knows his work
watson mutanga,2 decimal places means your figure has two numbers after the decimal sign. The last number is affected by whether the third number is below or above the number 5. 69.98 is already in two decimal place format. It becomes 70 after its converted to a whole number. "@Felix Muyoba - the point is that the government doesn‚Äôt own the revenues it collects. It‚Äôs from taxpayers @Stephan Dolk - how is the judge doing that? "@Khensani Rose: are the Guptas white? If you continue complaining about being disadvantaged "Inequality exists in every society
Thelsa,When working with Mr Peter Volmink I found him to be a man of high morale principles
Lorna Kavanagh,Felix it rounds off to 70 only if the 69.98? and third decimal place is over 5 then it becomes 70. ... then it stays as .69.8 and cannot change to .70 the gentleman says it has to be 3 decimal points to change .... but they require it to be 3 decimal points it is their regulations (government) that it be done thus... it makes a big difference when talking about billions of ramd. if the contract/tender states 3 decimall points then courts will stand by that. Felix i am going by what this gentleman said to the commission.
Beatrice Wambui,eff all the way

Ali daacad laky alii,hi
Ashney Chetty,Mr Volmink is one of a few people within Public Sector Procurement that understands the complexity of the numerous ambiguous pieces of legislation Mr Volmink is providing an invaluable service to this Commission
Sofia Sofia,Has the ANC won the elections ? Was this a FAIR election? Whats your take on this ?
Mokhosi Mohapi,"the people have spoken
Sthakathi Khumalo,I am really trying to understand the gentlemen with powder milk hair testimony and its contribution to the commission... Obviously Can`t we just have Molefe come answer to this?? Khensani Rose You remind me of Moises Machel!! Powder Milk hair is saying Molefe awarded contracts unlawfully.. Powder Milk is bitter suka!! The guy giving testimony is powder milk hair

walk in beauty,@DavidMiles no genocide?? "Malema sings ""kiss the Boer's "" The world sees what's happening.."
Stephan Dolk,uh uh judge. stop manipulating
Bongani Lejoane,"what's the use no one will be accountable for corruption
Lloyd Langenhoven,Kheshani what socks do you smoke? Whites control president selection? Do you not see the black president we currently have? "Oh come on Why is there a black president if whites control it all? How does that work? "It's ironic that you accuse others of racism yet you display blatant racism yourself "A ""white black"" now? hahahaha" "Rose is a closet racist Blacks under the feet of whites?! CYRIL IS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE. "Let me guess He is Colonel Sanders 92% of what? "Also ANC itself doesn't even have land audit stats but Rose magically has them Anyways - I'm waiting for Rose to tell us how whites control the voting and appointment of the President. She turned to the wrong page in her EFF book - that's why she shouted out 92%. "No I cannot. Rose started this debate. I'm just testing her racist views
Born free,Stop blaming whites for everything. Research Africa's history it was the Africans that captured Africans and sold them to slaves traders Research The Arab slave trade. Arabs and the African slave trade lasted 13 centuries long before the Europeans arrived and lasted from the 7th century to 1960s. It would seem that black apon black capture has not changed. That is the reason Africa is slow to progress. Felix I just urge you to research The Arab Slave Trade by David Gakunzi. I was shocked. Well it helped me to understand how Africans were Muslimised and that this took place for 1300 years. I will leave it at that.
Salt-Mine Boss,"Indd Lloyd Rose are you Khoi or San. Or do you know how to grow food that can keep the ground you have beneficial TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY? If not..Don't claim. "Page 12 chapter 2 "But lets not pretend the entitity of Africa is..""'Rose""..It is not."
Khensani Rose,You don‚Äôt know politics shut up. If blacks are truly in control and able to have free reign of their countries there wouldn‚Äôt be 8% of the population that owns 94% of the land. Please shut UP! Read a history book. Preferable one that is NOT written by a racist! The only people that have truly advanced in AZANIA under ‚Äúblack presidents‚Äù have been whitest. Any white person living in South Africa and comfortable with 92% of the original habitants current conditions are the racist. Closet and openly.
