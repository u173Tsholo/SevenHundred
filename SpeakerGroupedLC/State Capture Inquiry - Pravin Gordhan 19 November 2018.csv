Guys i'm lost "i'm really lost here who is he reading to? shouldn't this info be shared and let the lawyers lead evidence? kindly advise @Norman Zwane maybe you know? what is this ? is this a lecture or presentation ? "the most boring session so far
Amanda Watson,Heita I see on Twitter Min Gordhan is unpacking his tea Why is BLF protesting tho? "It's not the people I wouldn't vote for the DA if you paid me too. @koena mabotja But why though? This whole CoI is because of the ANC? Even Ramaphosa has admitted now Lol Justice Zondo couldn't remember Moyane's name "Give it a rest @John Isaacs  Gordhan is the henchman... bwahahahahaha Altho I dunno why that's supposed to be insulting 🤓
Mali Mthimkhulu,We in silindile Today must be interesting. Gordhan must be careful what he says otherwise it will backfire Lool Finally Loo his face 😂😂😂 SaBC like a family owned business
Sne Mdletye,"there has been a lot of lying amongst the top leaders in ANC usa vunghula uMzwai "no Roy

How do you highlight the name when responding to someone's comment? please assist. @ronin 187. Really thanks couse it doesnt show on my side. This man is like his reading bible. Nothing will come out of this testimony today. There are so many jokes and laugh going around here. Is this Trevoh Noah show or what? @Trucker . This SABC journalist. Gorrrdaann... I dont see where this is taking us to. This man is walking all over Zondo's head. he must just tell us if he has meet Guptas. thats all we want to hear. @Sthakathi Khumalo. My point. "One question "I've been sitting here for more than 2 hrs @Ewald Kruger. Eishhh... is like im watching Days of our lives. @Glorify Gumede. Lecture. Pravin is lecturing Zondo and at the end Zondo will write his final exam. "@Chioma Jonathan. He will Zondo is struggling to understand who we are to understand. @Sthakathi Khumalo. 😂😂😂
Andre' Van Zyl,morning everyone.
Tamara Mbopeni,🤣🤣🤣 who do you think we are Michael Holmes... we wont dare vote DA... corruption is the same as Racism
koena mabotja,WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANC AND EFF COME 2019 WE VOTING FOR ANC The peoples advocate representing the corrupt "EFF outside protesting agaisnt Gordan who implicated Tom Moyane lol their superior logic is amazing We need a commision of inquiry into Limpopo Capturer by On-Point Engineering looooollll Is it the very Pravin EFF and other political parties were defending? Interesting question by Gordhan Which politician doesnt have business interests in South Africa? "Vusi Gordhan is well composed BLF is the only party consistence with their call for Pravin to go When is EFF coming to present its story "Since EFF knows the truth Pravin must tell
Joseph Thobejane,did privin Godan appointed by Gupta family to become a minister of finance 90% of the ANC minister are appointed by Gupta family @sandile i get it from EFF where is EFF outside which money after this commissioned who is going to in jail or their just waisting tax Payer's money
Sindiswa Moolman,A very important moment. Gordhan is the very important witness to both his enemies and friends alike. More so to South African. "We have Moyane's lawyer Thank you @Bheki Mdletshe Pravin is a tough cookie @Martin phiri What is a problem @Thato M ? Being a member of Investec board and funding SaveSA... is there a problem in that? I want to know if there is a problem in funding SaveSA by Investec and the fact that the witness here is a member of? @Thato M ? Shiny @Dragonblazer24 ! It is strange that those who work hard against corruption are accused of being corrupt by those who are alleged to be corrupt Politics of distraction @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I agree @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Yaaa... @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Thats exactly what these people are doing @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I can see Gordhan presenting for 3 days. "No @Makwa Choma "Furthermore Surely the Guptas are watching this testimony. He is breaking down the State Capture Project Team Listen and learn @Marvel Ramatshela. We all agree that State Capture was a project. He is outlining the project plan and the framework of this project. I agree @Ewald Kruger Wena @israel nkuna must join your friends outside the Commission venue and let us listen to this man. Some people just want throw shades at him @Ewald Kruger
Sandile Steer,Lets address the Land issue first. WE WANT IT BACK. I wonder whr do u get your STATS from Joseph
Martin phiri,In DA are too much whites...... in EFF are too much... black..... ANC mix Vote ANC in 2019 EFF they ignore everything it has started already Parvin will resign in few days time Zuma's government was most stealing one in the country when u in politics but u don't know anything about it
Wesley M,Martin lol!!! Michael DA wants black vote withwhite rul. not gonna happen. there we go! all politicians are lairs. even Julius is liar. liar. Tikvah. true. lol!! "do you think that Gedleyihlekisa will give his cooperation when he comes. i think he is just going to laugh at everybody. but he must come Norman. i also think so. he will dodge this inquiry. people when you what ro respond to someone specific on this live chat. how do you the orange mark on the name???
Norman Zwane,@Desmond Masilela There is a difference between African Time and The Time in Africa; which of these is 10:30? "@Michael Holmes: Transform the DA?Waste of energy @Desmond Masilela It's not. It is 10:07 by my watch. Lol "@Martin phiri : Don't get your hopes up @Glorify Gumede: Reality show??? Are you on Mzansi wethu? @Glorify Gumede : I see. Is that all commissions? "@Glorify Gumede Whatever sails your boat...so maybe ""enjoy"" would be appropriate" "@Glorify Gumede I think you are mixing your metaphors here; how does one ""discover"" what is already in the public domain "@Wesley Myburgh: I dont he will come "This guy has played to the crowd with great assistance from baba ka Duduzane "Jeer "@Mgcini Tshwaku ""tentatively""?" @Mgcini Tshwaku Pravin is very interesting character; He seems to have made as many friends as enemies. He is liked and disliked with equal passion in various quarters. "@Hound Keryn: ""Take EFF lightly at your own peril"" "@Sandile Khowane Basaminyile "@Hound : All I am saying is anyone who ignores them "@Mkhululi Bushula By being member of the ANC means he is a crook SABC movie right now. look like a Schuster movie. See what happens when you dont pay your staff - you look like a right royal backside Are most picketters out of work persons? Yes. Meeting the Guptas means tht in this context. Just catch up.

But I am also working on the side @Manzi Iznam - the volume is too high and we have our own accounts to link up
Bonani Maphini,Lest hope Mr Gordan is not carrying lies to this Commission That look from Pravin Lots of leagal eagles in the house....wonder how much they charge per hour. Our tax Let the dirty tricks start

Sofia Sofia,Pravin please don't give us anything shocking ive had faith in you ... u break it and we are over !
Thato M,Bring it on EFF Chair and cross examine this holier than thou bloke Jamnadas "@pjn2001 your dreaming. Read an economic textbook on monopolies of scale - globally "In this ""State of Capture""only black people are implicated Since 1652 This guy is a lackey of white interests He is what is referred to as a gate keeper Pravin's daughter - Anisha Gordhan made millions with the State while his father was head of Treasury "Anisha Gordhan sits on the board of Investec I meant EXCO of Investec Leave these people. Let's discuss the content and what we know. These people are a distraction "@Sindiswa Moolman expand your question Gordhan is giving us lullabies.. No content. @Sindiswa Moolman replace the name Anisha Gordhan with Thuthukile Zuma and tell me if you be this relaxed I am not interested in people who don't argue content or logical reasoning but hurl insults. Not interested "@Sindiswa Moolman look at the companies Anisha Gordhan sits in their boards as a shareholder rep for Investec @Sindiswa Moolman check contracts obtained while ad was Min of Finance @Sindiswa Moolman it would come as no surprise why then SAVESA sponsored by Investec & others why they wanted certain people out of gov - becuase their business interests were taking a serious toll "You missed nothing except the Ministers own view on what's been happening. nothing substantial @peter pott 1652 "Gordhan must go to Generations "We are only interested in financial flows @simon vilakazi nothing but the truth. Pity the WMC chief benefactor wouldn't curse the mouth that feeds him by ensuring the Terms of Reference go back that far "Gordhan what makes you say these events constitute ""state of capture""? Stop rumbling with fancy words" @Mark Smith you like Pravin are the first one's to be locked up. A beneficiary of the most heinous crime has no say in what the terms of the reparations should be. "Imagine if the UN declared Apartheid as a crime against humanity "Look at the contracts Bidvest "He is talking in analogies in an Inquiry "When a person on stand has no facts Pravin is dithering. This is more of a political lecture than Inquiry submission @selo makgato you could say that again. @Jake Carrot you are lying through your teeeth on those JSE ownership Somebody just said there are no monopolies in the economy? 😀😀😀 They must be white @Jake Carrot YOU ARE LYING JACK! @Jake Carrot STOP lying about the JSE ownership. We are not kids. @Jake Carrot perhaps you need to be honest @sam motabogi 😀😀 love you too Gordhan is the henchmen for the neo liberal within the ANC. Anti left and propragate for neo liberalism @sam motabogi which rhetoric? According to who? "The National Treasury budget @sam motabogi why not? "@sam motabogi white is white "@sam motabogi white owned businesses are just that @Atholl Hay 😀😀😀 In your dreams @Willie Makena it is politicians people vote in to power but are throttled by big business to follow their ways.. International principle. @Houws Houlinou a white person who benefited from apartheid has zero credibility to tell me about legitimacy. I am not here to appease you guilty conscious. Had Joshua Doore said something substantial? *has "Gordhan pushes policies which are neo liberal Please read their research report on SA and the macro economic framework they want SA to pursue These are similiar policies the DA is pushing "So two factions within the ANC exist "The argument that the State is inherently corrupt and big business is NOT is flawed. The world is reeling from the World Financial Crises "The schism world over "Africa is poor today because its natural resource are owned by a few families @Jake Carrot nap time "Gordhan represent this class @Jake Carrot speak Setswana "It cannot be that Pravin Gordhan is all holy and he alone is the person to save SA from this so called State Capture. It is about which facton and business interests he represents "The same one's the Inquiry is housed at @Glorify Gumede lecture😀😀😀 hayi "@Sthakathi Khumalo the sooner you understand why townships exist "@Sthakathi Khumalo the sooner you realise why black people even here comment in a foreign language-English @THATO GENNOTO yes bitso! "If State Capture is about protecting the citizens of this country "@GERALD THWALA imagine subjecting all gogos's who owned pension to words like revenue collectiion "Detroit "Question: Why is the currency of an emerging economy like ours SA These are global superpowers they won't tell you about @Des Let you are funny LONMIN = London Mine. Which Rmapahosa chaired This guy and his billionaire advisors is a bore. This man is supposedly going to SAVESA Gosh Was there ever any disciplinary hearing on him by Gordhan or his team? Jusxtapose this with the role the bank in question played in SaveSA campaign. "These aren't substantive matters Gordhan is putting forward He is playing to the media narrative. Reports with no substantive evidence. I bet media on social media are labelling this as breaking and substantial evidence. Their love affair is well documented "Who lucnch

"@sam motabogi Whatever guy. I'm not here to nurse your emotions & sympathy for white @Mark Smith and you suffer from colonialism and apartheid amnesia. "@sam motabogi AH YES @Jake Carrot WHAT PART OF WHAT I SAID IS NOT FACTS? @Mark Smith and you sir are an apartheid beneficiary. "@sam motabogi By learned are you referring to a degree? LOL Anyway @sam motabogi Pravin himself told BBC Hardtalk that he has no evidence against Zuma. @sam motabogi I can bet you money right now that Pravin has no evidence. He talks about jigsaw puzzles and hypothesis. Lol. Just hogwash and air. Looks like Pravin Gordhan is now chairing the inquiry? Like it’s his lecture & the subject is corruption "Dear White People That inequality is largely driven by Apartheid and has a clear racial dimension. The arrogance. A whole former Finance Minister isn’t taking responsibility for his part. Pravin Gordhan has to quote the likes of Trevor Manuel because this is your Johan Rupert crew which is guarding against anyone like Guptas trying to hijack SOEs. "US Vice President said: ""Do not accept foreign debt that could compromise your sovereignty."" Which is what Pravin Devil Gordhan wants." "Pravin Gordhan claims his ""advanced age"" will affect his recollection of how many times he met with the Guptas. He is exactly 7 years younger than Jacob Zuma."
Dumisani Gcuma,The whole EFF is full of liars.

carol dhludhlu,EFF only there to support Moyane hmnn how many skeletons are lurking at Sars against EFF? Gordan stays to sweep clean the SOE's then after he can go Solomon agreed How has anyone been held accountable in our countries current state? report to who? "Dear White People stop the Koi-San narrative and get educated

Magnificent Thela,Interesting 🤔
Remembrance Gape Skenjana,He has no reason to lie
Leonard Masweneng,his crocodIle smile
Mkhululi Bushula,But even his opponents don't show any facts against him even the eff brigades are just making spurious allegations. That's the big question now. The eff were the first to celebrate his return after des van rooyen disaster. If Gordhan is corrupt why there is nobody laid criminal charges against him up to this day. Instead he has been tried through the court of public opinion. I agree with u Solomon They are trying to intimidate him. But he is brave that's why they say he is arrogant. We have always expected a push back from the state capturet's. The ppl who are dangerous are those who sold our country to the highest bidder. Investec is private corporation. I reiterate my first comments if Gordhan is corrupt he must be exposed. But nobody has done that so far. But many comments showed that they hate the man with passion. Unfortunately when corruption is is done by private sector there is too much sugarcoating it's either is called accounting irregularities or anticompetitive behaviour As much as I agree with many of the issues Thatho M raised but we can support corruption just bcs is our brothers who committed it. We voted them into power bus we trusted them I steal have the full confidence in the anc regardless of it's shortcomings. If white ppl are not racist why they felt offended when the words racism and apartheid are mentioned. "They are offended

solomon simelane,Very interesting that EFF is hellbent on stopping Gordhan while protecting Moyane. If Gordhan is guilty he has to be exposed but the conduct of EFF is very suspect. What are they afraid of. WHY??????? @Frank Matau why r people so agitated about the procession of the commission today? there is no hurry here. If he is not done today he can always come tomoro etc. @Trucker he is giving evidence why all the rush? @trucker he has to give background. let us b patient. cross examination will elicit answers.

"Remember PG isn’t there because he is implicated PG is snitching but doing it very smart. Listen 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾 Every time he says “as an example” listen properly cause he’s gonna drop a subtle bomb. Listen to what he is saying about Mr Fuzile and Gigaba. Listen to what he’s saying about the bottles of water. He is breaking down the simplest forms of state capture before we got here.
