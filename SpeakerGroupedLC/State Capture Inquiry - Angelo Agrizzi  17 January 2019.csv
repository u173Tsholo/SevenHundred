Desmond Masilela,@Aubrey Moloi. Yet people are still voting them. @Aubrey Moloi. They have power of the vote. 100% agree. look at the ANC now. Some people still believe that Zuma is still the president of the country. they dont regard Cyrial as our president. Where is the video? I dont see anything interesting here did Agrzzi accept any bribe while he was still there? Thank you @Robert Russell. I wonder what made him to come forward to testify? Is the any gorvenment people involved in this Bosasa. the likes of ministers? "@The Jack-all. Okay okay........ Now i understand. There are politicians as well

MrLifem,This guys is confusing me. Unfortunately i cant probe what he is saying. the two Vaults that he is talking about. where was the money kept? which vault? This guy is dropping serious files
Roux Beukes,what is Agrizzi's title or job? This person is not rich.. it is stolen money. hahaha! VLC would sort that out. down with windows media player ! Judas - just google it. a bit much of a story 😃 HAHA technological matters beautiful. technological matters... an expert. this guy looks like a real expert! """googling VLC"" >> ""Clicks download latest version for Windows""" you think he eats money? 😀 thats a ROG laptop... i could do with some free kfc right now to be honest. i think Agrizzi would also like that! 😀 do we know with which bank Bosasa was banking with? doesnt matter the race - there will always be corruption across all races/ yeah it has nothing to do with white people😂 there are people of all races that are part of this. we have human criminals here 😛 we are in 2019... how can we not pause a video with space bar at the right time? come on man! give me a bag! "Cyril's son accepted a R500k payment from bosasa to an ABSA account but imagine 1.3bn ZAR being spent on education.... "but stop voting for them
Sindiswa Moolman,He was Bosasa COO @Roux Beukes "He is doing an ""Agliotti"" snitching hopping that he will get immunity from prosecution." I think its for subsidized employees in government @Khalid Mather. It is a scheme for officials who do a lot of official travelling SMS stands for Senior Managers Services Senior Management Services @Khalid Mather Who was going to get this money? This man is going to mention 38 names who were bribed by Bosasa. I am trying to think and wonder who is consulting his or lawyers right now. I think its the witness @Sino Msane He was trusted to do so because he was also part of the whole corrupt cabal @Sino Msane It is here to confuse us @Andrew Mounsear-Wilson How was this money withdrawn from the banks? How did it leave the banks @The Jack-all ? can somebody enlighten me? Hope the Hawks are already on their way to raid Bosasa offices
