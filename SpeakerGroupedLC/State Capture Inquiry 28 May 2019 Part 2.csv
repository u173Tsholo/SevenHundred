Born free,This BEE nonsense is killing this country as it is designed against a minority group. But then corruption has nothing to do with BEE only corrupt people in the system. Yes at the expense of a minority of taxpayers. And so we look at the majority group involved in theft. How noble these people are that enrich themselves through theft. Welcome to Africs Africa Consider this less than 40% of the population are registered taxpayers You are fortunate to have left but others are South Africans 300 years removed from their ancestral countries and have no place to go. History repeats itself that is why Africa is a third world continent. Ahh faulty answer
