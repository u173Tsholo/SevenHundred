I think @Gee Peex1 will be a very suitable replacement SABC runnung low on data. Any sponsors? Just checked eNCA is a million times better with no interruptions. Bye bye. see u there
Pheladi Lamola,Some sense of humour with this guy. Thugs.

Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I'm glad you've seen the light RE Malema. He and the EFF are fascists - the only thing we haven't seen from them YET is the goose-step. @Thami Nobela I do - they're all heroes who stood up to a madman. @Ian Sibin Sorry to read of your troubles. Stand firm.

Buti Sipho,empty hall🥱
Born free,A well spoken and educated lady She is the economics editor at SABC Give the woman the power to govern this country Power to the Woman She will reject you.. Jacob.. only the dumb ones marry you. We will start with the zulus Haha Jacob I love to be a virgin 🤣👍 I live to be a virgin I am Khoisan.. Jacob. South Africa truly belongs to me because of my heritage. Jacob.. you are truly ugly to look at. Yes Jacob.. you have an ugly face.. it would Make a difference It would make a difference.. Jacoob.. if she left an impression on your face. "I don't mind the Nigerians going back.. just leave the Malawian's Okidoki. Aliens take over it is wise not to allow just anyone in to any country. Alpha and Omega 😂😂🤣🤣 Beginning and the End 🤣🤣🤣 yes it is 👍 I was born in the wild that's what makes me born free. True under a thorny bush tree @Sipho Dube.. I agree it has such an impact that many shipping companies are not wanting to do business in South Africa. South Africans don't want to work as well as foreigners and companies are sick and tired of protests. I think owning a business in this country is risky to say the least. Interesting.. conspiring against Pravin Gordhan. Gordhan had his special Investigative SARS team investigate Malemas Italian sponsor for tax evasion. Road Rage 😲 Intimidation You will need whites to design. My brothers are blood related as are my sisters. Since when do black people in SA refer to blacks from other countries as their brothers and sisters?? Yes it's horrible "It's terrifying being chased He wanted to frighten the ladies because he is an idiot. Who wants to work at the SABC??
Mkululi Mcotsho,yq0p
Claude Ntirenganya,stop genocide please
Antonie Goosen,Nigerians owe me a lot of money...have many emails as proof... Pay the money! lol lol Trump only cares about himself The Aliens left - -found no intelligent life in the US Thandeka Gqubule doing maths lol Yip. More woman abuse...by the ANC cadres this time The main problem of SA -NOTHING HAPPENS ! Mr Ungerer perhaps now at Elevator Modernization Specialists ? Curious to know why he chased them "Ok Still starnge that he is also connected to the SABC Jan Ungerer? poor Zondo..he probably llies awake at night after hearing all these terrible stories for so long Same - so unjust and cruel "The SA/ANC government is apparently one of the largest purchasers of electronic spyware "Was disclosed in US congress No - the supplier / developer had to make full disclosure. Think SA was one of their largest clients I think it was in one of the Wikileads documents - should find it again. "FinFisher produces and sells computer intrusion systems "Specifically Lol will eard about it. "Very scary. I had interactions with high level ANC members and told that their spying is seriously scary - even their own members are monitored constantly They do - and have the finances "Had a client The problem is that it is abused - power corrupts and is later used for personal and political gain "Yip Supposed to be used for marketing purposes but adapted for spying on its citizens hope that he appears Sjhould leave Zondo alone with Hlaudi in a locked room @Diss & Dad Yes its honest intended use Thats what the malware can be used for the joker? Pleasure - will read about their case tonight

JS Bach,Who is this lady in the yellow? Hlaudi's bullies This poor lady lived through horror!!! They should call this Ungerer-guy to come and testify! @Born free are you listening to what this poor lady is saying? ZUma also tries the spy card. I feel soooooo sorry for this lady! Where is that crazy fool Hlaudi now? Yes! He got TWO votes.....😂😂😂😂 He voted for Hlaudi and Hlaudi voted for him. @Anne M. Yes! 😂😂😂😂 @Anne M. Yes!!! Idiot!!! "@threedeespace He's to busy speaking to this Hlaudi @Anne M. or Hofmeyr @Reward Mushayabasa Yes I agree. She is the best. @threedeespace the freak in the purple suit. Yuck! "@threedeespace Each time Hlaudi was on TV Hlaudi is Chucky's cousin.
Kopz Koape,Who is this fine Lady speaking she is fine @Born free..Who told u that u were born free??? @Anne M..Is she married? @Born Lol..Whatever @Anne M.Thank u .In Sesotho we say kea lebohea..Meaning I appreciate it @Sipho then the gov should ensure that employers hire only south Africans problem solved @ Born free that is not true most south African want to work..We want decent wages that's all. White employers are greedy and wanna maximize profits
Sipho Dube,"hi guyz but what went wrong with the emaswati oneni wona "do you know Guys that when you do this chaos (burning of trucks) we all get affected as we are in the same region "kopz be-careful "imali yeqolo and refuse school as if they will remain young "Shaun "no Shaun uzobona mhla no shipment comes to RSA and no one out that your country has a problem "Shaun at least you are communicating which mean you have been to school whomsoever put the idea of government will do for us RDP water electricity and imali yeqolo was a fool

Anne M.,@JS Bach @Kopz Koape Ms Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki "I think so @Kopz Koape 😃 you're welcome Scary stuff "Yes I hope other companies who use Schindler Lifts will insist that Ungerer is not allowed on their properties. Do you know him @Antonie Goosen ? @Antonie Goosen Probably not a coincidence "Schindler said it was road rage And the people throwing around the spy claims know how dangerous it is to make that claim. I think it's her married surname "No @emma matela That would be a circus 😉 Didn't Hlaudi start a political party? And didn't he lose his deposit? @JS Bach 😂😂😂 Couldn't have happened to a nicer person /S And Adv Gcabashe must grill him 👍
PETER STAFFEN,Question time was not bad at all
Thulani Bukani,I loved Question Time. that guy was dealing with the issues.
WAPE NEWS TV,This is the time when the South African government is given economic sanctions to see if they can bring about development in their country. "Remember aliens are the catalyst for social development "At present South Africa has no foreigners "Up until South Africa they did not go to law and how to do business without a permit For this the South African government must be held accountable for ongoing events. "If he does not follow the law he cannot build that house unless he has followed the rules and regulations he can build "Remember even other countries have your people "Now I understand you "Let's be one of the Africans that built our continent "How do you
understanding maths,it because of this barbaric behavior getting a job is one's favor whether u are a South African or foreign nation yeah where are the whites do you see talking about this attacks on foreign national they probably saying that :we should kill one another The image of South Africa is taken into consideration sipho what is your profession? Do you think those shop owners are illegal? Do you even know what is an immigrant? why when a black tries to fight poverty another black men interferes? no weapons of the wicked shall harm us we will kill each other Shaun be realistic my bro those who come to South Africa legally pay to be here Do you know that Shaun? a lazy person is worse that the one who destroys looting will never make u rich. Get involved in an activity greatman what are you trying to say? who are you? greatman u do not know anything about immigrants just shut up please Do you even know about visas and permits?
Frans Du Plessis,"we can never be the same
ally kamal,"Lol some comments though
Shaun 21,we also need to fix the problem of entitlement as many people would prefer to hire foreigners because they work hard when south africans tend to act like the job is their right this is south africa and that means that south africans and LEGAL immigrants are first inline some of them are i know a few local businesses here in the suburbs of jozi that arent exactly legal an immigrant is someone who crossed the border legally not the nigerian whos filtering his money through a small business We are south Africa we can survive because the world needs us more then we need them as proven when the world had sanctions on us during apartheid south africa doesnt have a problem with legal immigration it has a problem with illegal immigration there is a difference you know i gaurentee all the south africans in nourthern africa most likely are there legally because theres no point in going there illegally but violence is never the answer our saving grace will be commisions like this because we face corruption and if we dont get rid of corruption our borders wont be protected and we will keep going in this direction xenophobia lack of services and all this things stem directly from corruption and downright incompetence we deal with the source of the problem and all the symptoms will dissipate no i believe that they have all gotten here due to the corruption that trickles down from the top and i believe that they shouldnt be here and they are a drain on our society focus on your own countries problems fight for your country dont leave your people behind to deal with them without you theres no slavery in south Africa and i dont support theft and violence but i understand where it comes from and why its happening
Greatman Elozino,"and your country would suffer more because it is ur soil "if the shops are not legal then your government has it's own issues to This myth also just be a plan to make all blacks hate themselves because if we are together we are stronger. someone is wanting to bang our heads together. I wish we can all see it. "if someone comes to ur own house without ur knowing even if they entered wrongly then your government should know that some of your people have helped them. No one can pass a secured entry if a person inside does not hide him in through a hole So your guys are helping Nigerians in illegally
Andy Johnson,This country is in big trouble. Evil forces are at work to make everyone hate each other. I wou
