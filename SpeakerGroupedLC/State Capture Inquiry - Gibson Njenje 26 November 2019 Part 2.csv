Zondo's hands are lighter his face is dark/ peach black @Bianca Arnold Just noticed @makhosi nobhatyi You will miss me😀😁😂
Sekgololo Johannes,"Pravin must be the Minister of SOEs and Finance. He can do both Ndlovu u r captured. Khumalo u killing me if Zuma is innocent then I will head back to being dumb. why is the witness so incoherent? wasn't this guy in the intelligence?
Sthakathi Khumalo,"Njenje is hiding a whole lot of things but its understandable Intelligence requires you to hide some things Zuma is corrupt just like all the ANC comrades but you just have to find evidence to pin it to him which is a difficulty at this point!! "Wiseman Mabasa HE is part of the issue "Tumi Sereme​ NOT only GUPTAS "I can imagine Nxamalala saying ZUMA was not operating alone!! THE whole ANC were overseeing and getting donations from these entities. ANC must stop playing with people. But ZONDO listens shame...I give that to him!! Catch him if he is lying He knows where this document is Nxamalala will deny this! "Let me go camp in Nxamalalas twitter account "Zuma will say Let me go wait in his twitter account hehe Watson was on the CR17 cabal
Queen K,Mmm unamanga lo baba 🤔 He was @Sekgololo.
BanditZA,There is a lie somewhere here There’s lies mixed with truths here Definitely more than 3 of them were present Steenhuisen for president ;) Mittal Steel Jindal Steel All operate in Africa How is that relevant?
SNENHLANHLA VILAKAZI,he seems to be speaking lies something smells fishy with this man🤦‍♀️ I also would🙋‍♀️
Bonginkosi Gumede,. . ...
Bernard Matolino,"@Sekgololo Johannes I just love that word -- incoherent Lakshmi Mittal is a self made respectable man from my understanding
Wiseman Mabasa,"If President Ramaphosa is serious of restoring dignity to Anc he will fire those involve unless if he is involve as well
Nkululeko Mdluli,😁😂😂 @ wim low
Granny Mokwena,the level of disrespect from these so called officials out of line "what he did against the country is treason Dr what? the whole cabal is shameless!! it's like the mafia "all the hard work was this during the sheep time? blocked him cwele must be hauled before the commission sooner than later yonnna imagine this guys the fp's evidence is shredded today
rosalind gerber,who pillages the pristine SA beaches has anyone been able to find a link btw these Guptas and the Gupta involved with cricket match fixing - (Hansie Cronje)?? I know...@Michael Wild but maybe? Two lots of Guptas pulling the wool over our eyes. @Spykerhond Mandela and Mbeki makes you think Sahara is an international company - the Guptas arrived in SA and named their company after a reputable global brand "@redriger yes @Tumi Sereme would you bet money on him being innocent? you can blame apartheid for anything.. how about colonialism??? #ReturnTheCullinan how about hard labour on a coal mine how funny its such a lovely black though... i'm gob smacked no curry at zuma's?
Wildthing,McDonalds BEE company. he won the franchise for SA and maybe large parts of Africa you est. he earns from that eat do you understand what I said. CR owns the rights to McDonalds through SA. each time anyone eats McDonalds product. CR gets a little of it. work out how many items are eaten a day in SA. That could be true and if so I hope it comes out too. same forcing process used to take over the coal supplies to Exdom. until they had the full supply line of coal to Exdom Guptas is a common surname in India. could be true. now it hits home so he has it Goat we not going to start that game again. no CT and have his Facebook details
Jean-Pierre Le Roux,how did he get 300m macdonalds
Mike Newlands,I am beginning to wonder just how many millions rands the ANC cadres and ministers and Guptas could have made with insider trading knowing in advance who was to be fired and appointed?
Sam Monkoe,@Mbuso Ndlovu Have faith we can solve the problem
Robert Russell,Apart from his own outlets.... CR gets 8% of turn over from every other outlet every month....work that out....@Michael Wild Where is that file in the NPA now? "Read the ""Presidents Keepers""......tells exactly this story of ZUMA and his stooges..."
Kevin Simon,This is going to be interesting!
Muzamani Ronald,Mr zondo is a real judge
Thapelo Motabogi,😂😂😂😂
BONKE XAKATHA,My best advice is...Do not Start anything that is Corruption..even if its as small as a salt grain...ey Bro..it catches up with one later on Ilizwe liya kwantshabalalo kancinci kancinci. Le state capture inquiry soze iphele lide ilizwe li collapse
Tsepang R,We pay taxes to the Guptas in this country! sickening
MIKE DURBAN,Notice how All these ANC big boys.....All wear Russian/Commie spy glasses........heheh @Tumi Sereme ....well...that's the ANC Gov for you.... They called the Spy Glasses Clan...heheh Geeez......the Curry Bunnies must have flowed in Zumatjies office.........eeeesh Man...truck loads of these Curry Bunnies came to Capital Hill...to feed the whole building... Makes you think hey.......... Well....it's Bunny time......
Tumi Sereme,"Whether we like it or not What proof or evidence confirm Zondo is corrupt? "Without evidence "Jesus was serving purpose for his people

People are you hearing this?🙆‍♀️ They thought they were meeting Ajay at the Sheraton but the meeting was at Mahlambandlovu(Zuma's res). When they got there Ajay welcomed them and took them to Zuma's study.@redriger Guptas were the real president(s). Zuma was just their puppet. Agreed @Lizo William "If Zuma does go to jail

Phillip Cwazibe,This is really reveling. Mr. Gupta in charge of the State President's official residence. revealing @ Bianca Arnold ​ Indeed this is where state capture rears its head and manufactured.
