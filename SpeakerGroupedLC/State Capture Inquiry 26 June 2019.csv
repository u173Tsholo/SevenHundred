the one and only,Who is on the grilling seat today? Looks like its the CEO of SAA. this one better be prepared not like the mediocre we saw the past three days Disaster by advocates 😱 @Naledzani Mashau i doubt hey. remember the only thing the commission does is give recommendations Mzimela is guilty Ms September does not have confidence in her questions shes just making me 😒
Sebation Nantsika,Morning bathong Ms September you out of order Poor Ms September maybe she was disturbed by something When is legal team getting payed? Zuma is coming please Ms September take a sick leave Zuma is coming with the interpreter Ms September you are the one asking questions relax Sabc do something with this Girl sexxx
Lesley Shonani,ndaa lol🤣🤣
Clem Ramsey,)
tshisikhawe Muthavhine,lotsha ma africa tshipembe
makhosi nobhatyi,Ask her Judge Zondo Tea time break
Naledzani Mashau,Ndaa Lots have zwavhudi All those implicated in this commission would be arrested and tried. Mark my word The USA president has assigned to that country's ambassador to keep an eye on SA as a potential investment destination that is why they are hovering over Ramaphosa actions like a hawk I hear you Sbonelo His legal team will first argue on those allegations against him after which they will lead him if the commission set aside his argument
carnoth ngomane,This advocates are always not fully prepared Poor preparations "@Norman Zwane i fully agree with you @Cassius Mngomezulu I would prefer Adv Maleka The witness is more relaxed compare to Miss SEPT Thank you Dcj @Rox Moleme or maybe laugh at the evidence leader
Jayden Bango,what a poor start Poor advocate looks stressed already b4 she even gets to the core this woman must be changed during tea somebody sms hofmeyer please we cant take this "this habit of calling each other my learned friend must stop. evidently @Norman Zwane please educate me it really irritates....why do they do it ok thanks hofmeyer to the rescue

Takalani Nemushungwa,ndaa
khakhathi kk,dzi khou vhuya

Prudence Mokoena,all this is to undermine somebody's authority.
Rox,some evidence leaders in this commision are not on par MS September is always found wanting Hahahah Mabena of the commision "This commision has cost us 240 something Million ZAR "Zondo is right Hahahah @Norman is this Jessica Motaung ??? 🤔🤔🤔 lol Hahahah @Abel This looting amounts to treason or Murder "Lol @Norman Zwane Ncncn angry? here comes Illuminati Hahahah this link must be destroyed There is a suspicious Surname on this live chat🤔 Hahahah how are eyes beautiful now? is it a colour or what?

I will rather come back later """ Who appoints Ministers? really now" Hahahahahaha mxm "@Joburg this is not a learning platform  "9 Million people are unemployed "4 Muniscipalities won't be paying their employees and Banks don't care "Hahahah @Mashau that's deep politics If Ms September fumbles again I will adjourn Hamba!! satane! the link Danie what is % we shall take 15 min in the next 2min...this hearing will be adjourned Danie do u know something about this links? who is Gigaba now? The devil refuse to go... "Let me check if my money is still available @Norman no gossip.please 😊 Hahahah links are sent by nameless people here people calling themselves Sssg ssg "Hahahah @Yolo is not even about race Hahahah Zondo will be accused of patriarchy "Zuma will come here and waste 2 days with answers like "" I don't know Ok @Yolo Lol @Bongani hahah Ms September asks a question and look at DJC to make sure if she is ok this time around adjourned!! This is DA advocate ...Katz Hahahah Pitso u are on your own katse will deal with Ms September
Norman Zwane,@carnoth ngomane The commission is getting bogged down by the calibre of the investigative team's naivette. Miss september must go back to articles. @Yolo More Are they not a collective aka ANC? "@Abel Matshidiso I think she is a cut out of Bafana @Yolo More If I was justice I would adjourn. This is not going to improve. "@Blackbird MediaZA Imagine the Proteas in a hearing "I think this going to to be paiful to watch @Sebation Nantsika I know I am making eye contact with her but I cannot accept blame @Yolo More You are sexist. Just listen to the witnesses testimony "@Rox Moleme Am actually permanently seated on a wheel-chair "@Yolo More I break my own rul just to accommodate you: let it be noted chair "@Thando Nkutha She is indeed not that way smart @welton paulse wanna take a bet DCJ makes a pass at the witness before she leaves the stand! @Danie Nilsen Let me guess - you frequent SAA flyer or you a DA with that 3 language greeting. anyway hi. "@Cassius Mngomezulu After looting of money you cant afford Adv Maleka SC "@Rox Moleme Since we doing so poorly on September @welton paulse I cant hear the giggle from grinding my teeth "Miss September must now ask ""Who appoints the president?"" now that she knows who appoints the minister. Just go the whole hog "@Zama Kubheka With Ms September in charge don't raise your hopes. It won't end "@Zama Kubheka People will just start walking away and only me who has his eye on Ms September will remain @Zama Kubheka I might not be corrupt but I'm sneaky. "@Danie Nilsen When you mean what Daniel? If you were ?Ms Septem""luring"" asking a silly question through a loudhailer" @Yolo More I dont think she expects an answer. I think in her notes she shouldx have written (Note to self - wait for an answer) @Bongani Ntuli Mancha's cryptic note suggests he might just be present @Bongani Ntuli Mphemba uyamazi uNxamalala uzosuke aqale ngeculo asiphulele ama microphones and uyawabona vele ayincikinciki abawokhamani. "@Bongani Ntuli Ikhona le yase high court -""Ngashaywe yizinsizwa engakhula nazo""" "@Tich Ziny Don't be shy "I could easily just turn my volume down and look at Sizakele Mzimela and Ms September "@Thando Nkutha I think I like them more @Rox Moleme Normally around this time when the dosage dies off they come out these monsters. @Jayden Bango Is a figure of speech meaning the exact opposite. @Jayden Bango Took it off English courts. Its silly really. Most attorneys don't use that English toffee language. @Bongani Ntuli I guess he has an album ready to be dropped via Big Nuzz "Guys start a campaign nominating me to rescue Ms September - ngeke nizisole "@Kevin Allister Simon That was before Ms September took over "@Bongani Ntuli I'd keep my eye on my Babes wo Duma if I was MaMpintsha
Yolo More,Not you again Ms September But at least the evidence leader always give satisfactory response but uSeptember always struggling Norman Zwane she can't even give satisfactory answers Only amateurs today and it's unacceptable She can't even differentiate between an affidavit and a statement Rox Molemw😇😇 exactly. "Norman Zwane😂😂😂 Mzimela looks dodgy. Maybe it's her beautiful round eyes and smile.😋😋 "Thando Nkutha Ms September must go back to modelling. She is too beautiful to be smart. "Hofmeyer Why are they keep on using her. They frustrate the Chair with this advocate. "Tich Ziny "Daniel She asks questions but does not hear the responses Norman Zwane😂😂 "Argh! I actually feel sorry for Miss September Was she the only coloured advocate who applied? "Rox Nooo Mr Katz don't finish her off plzzzzz September is causing problems for the chair
clive oconnell,Like juggling slippery eels this many witnesses. We need translation is Zuma asked to repeat any money’s stolen
Gift Speelman,just here to troll on serious note: what arrests has been made due to confessions heard in this commission "or will this be like TRC @Rox Moleme ..YOU CANT be serious man @Naledzani Mashau how sure are you? i get BMW car vibe from this woman "fine wine and dinning
Yanela Nokhele,"@Rox "@Joburg
Sofia Sofia,Give it up Man! I don't have a problem with Miss S! However I feel witnesses will be wasted because of her method of questioning . Its long boring and there is no UMPF! Maybe her team can assist her and ask more serious questions How are these advocates allocated ? Jobs are given to people is not what they know its who they know ! listen at least CR said 10 years to a decade .....

Kevin Simon,Katz just flashed a pained expression. I'm a little behind. Thando Nkutha ​PRETORIUS has conflict of interest . Please expand Thando Nkutha ​@Kevin Allister Simon he represents PG and their close friends. And the problem is? "Thando Nkutha. If not for Zuma Yes !! I'm expecting Zuma to replicate his behavior in the PP interview. Going to be very slow. Hope springs eternal.... RSA balanced on a knife-edge. This commission is vital to exposing the truth and invigorating foreign investor confidence. Without it we are a basket case. Sad.
Bruce Andrew,"Everybody has to start somewhere. Let her be We have a hacker 😀 she does have beautiful eyes "very well Who would you have to interrogate Zuma Pretorius or Hofmeyr?
Sindiswa Moolman,She was listed as one of Forbes magazine's most powerful women in 2011 She has memorised her evidence leading approach @spikijo Mak. Now she is struggling to deal with the unexpected.
