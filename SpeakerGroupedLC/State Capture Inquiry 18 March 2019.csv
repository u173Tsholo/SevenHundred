Magda Seguin,They had an excellent monitoring and evaluation system...most entities don't have definitive M&E That is what I can gather from his explanation Monitoring and Evaluation It is a discipline very often overlooked by companies...even NGOs Obvious @Ben Cole...State Capture State Capture is a term that was defined by the World Bank in 2001 ...ch3ck it out online. In essence...State capture is political corruption
Ben Cole,"Magda Seguin "in spite of all the plans "It's the ""how and who"" in the state capture process
Nduduzo Zondi,climax of political corruption
Eslon Eslon,ANC list is an indication that the Zuma faction are alive on their feet ready waiting CR to make a single political mistake then they will clip his wings Guys Dr. Makhosi Khoza is back in politics. Wonders will never end
Derek Main,Voting for the ANC is voting for more of the same. "@Nosiphiwo Zantsi After all the evidence of their criminality @Nosiphiwo Zantsi 11 million idiots @makhosi nobhatyi Ramaphosa sat by watching SA implode under Zuma for 7 long years and said nothing. What more proof do you need that he's as guilty as all the other cadres who protected Zuma.
Nosiphiwo Zantsi,Those who know nothing about me and my experience display arrogance in trying to tell me who I can vote for. I am voting ANC. 11 Million black people will vote for the ANC again. What is the past @psyfrequency Techno when you are still holding on to benefits of colonialism? We can't talk about the past while you want to hold on to the benefits of the past? What was the Land Act if you did not steal our land?
Slindile Ngcobo,ppl....JOIN THE DOTS.............................. @david jacobs ...easier to just say Zuptas...hehehehe
Tulonga Henoch,Gigaba again
Mzalwane Mzala,While I hate and condemn corruption I also check the intentions of those who agree with me. Transformation can not be compromised at the altar of false rainbow nationalism.
