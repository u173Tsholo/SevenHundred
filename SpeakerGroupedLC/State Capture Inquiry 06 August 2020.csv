Rory Lee Farnham,It ticks me off when people know what heycdfe
Sal SA,Morning all. Who is giving evidence this morning? His client should take the stand and give his version. He can apply to cross examine in future if necessary Too many postponements on day of hearing. DCJ must resolve this abuse Decline please DCJ Legal procedure is each party gives evidence then cross examine. So let's get it on. Public forum why not. it's our money and it's in public interest. This guy is wasting time. He must read the commission's rules and follow it. DCJ must rule Poor presentation from an SC DCJ its 11am - time is money DCJ he should know he can object when the questions are put to his client. Please rule. He must be summoned if he does not cooperate These legal guys are the problem- they must guide their clients properly "DCJ why it's your ""inclination"". You leaving the door open to argue." He's going back to the start of his argument Reputation is affected when you commit a crime. This is in public interest Yeah dismissed - crazy it took so long to rule. Zondo is not tainted "Esther this lawyer does not seem to know the rules of the commission He wasted our time and money Zulu has a nice smile- wonder if it will last.
Mike Newlands,Morning inmates Great sound tech guys thanks 😊 @Barbara Sattler I agree but it’s always going to be a case of the more guilty u are the harder u will push back the innocent sit & get on with it😃 This council is out of order these are PUBLIC. FUNDS. that have been stolen This reluctant witness has clearly been schooled in ANC Stalingrad stalling methods at Lootfreely House by Ace himself Actually these thieves have nothing to worry about they canjust sit & say yes I enriched myself off the poor & leave in thier Merc AMG. Nothing will happen to them nobody goes to jail if u are ANC @Barbara Sattler better make it a double- this witness must be seriously guilty just how much did he steal from out our trough! This advocate looks more desparate than his crooked client!
Riaan DW,"Shame
Caroline Hawanga,"Morning
makhosi nobhatyi,Ace Magashule is running out Why your client is scared to answer any questions? "I am happy DCJ dismisses Zulu application "Ace Magashule doesn’t like to write things down 😂🤪🤪🤪🤪 Dukwana said that He looks familiar ANC is using majority vote to escape questions and accountability and run away with the money 💰 "😂😂🤪🤪@ Cerebis but no ways to run away in this one "Ace Magashule is throwing this guy under the bus I tend to like mr Dukwana since he stand up to challenge Ace Magashule position but that was not sinking right into some comrade and he went further doing accusations but no one listens "@Pienaar van Wyk that is not going to happen as far as I know
Tony twins g s,Zimbabweanlivesmatter

Barbara Sattler,oh je people are beginning to sabotage the commission. Mr. Zondo must put his foot down. What a slimy bunch. "@Mike Clark that is my motto in life JZ also appeared in public. I am not saying all lawyers are slimy. @Sydney yes! Mr. Zulu is not present. Mr. P is an optimist. "If Mr. Zulu does not appear today I think I am off to the doctor. Need some hypertension medication. @Sydney I think it is my own fault. I take things very seriously. From now on everyone will receive a summons. Mr. Zondo mentioned this on Monday. Mr. Zulu looks like Mr. Over Perfect. @Samuel go ahead Mr. Zondo give this lawyer five minutes! @dada how much to the €? Mr. Zulu "Ja well I agree "no
Joseph Mtshali,Mr Commissioner
Hosia Modiga,kevin is it live somewhere? Thanks Kevin i see you responded to Mingosh. switch off the mic 🙂
Thabo Mokoaleli,"Application for postponement again "Counter argument from Adv. Pretorius is powerful So Mr. Zulu must give evidence because Mr. Dukwana feature no where and as a result anything regarding testimony is not part of evidence leader question. Indeed Adv. Pretorius is on fire😅😂🙈🤷 "Thank you At last a decisive Justice Zondo took a decisive view "Ace as SG will be there first to issue a statement that Zondo Commission is not a Court of law rather only a Commission. Just watch that space Zulu was the best Director General in FS Department of Human Settlements Sorry error Zulu was not the best Director General of Human Settlements 😂😅🤷 Fusi!! Oh no😂😅🤷 "With the current outrange from the ground

Solutions SA,no more extension of the time frame given to the commission. DCJ muat nip this postponement stories now legal team of the commission seems to be dropping the ball to often recently @Suicidal careful on your racial undertones Boss No one is more important than the other... people have been coming to give testimony. People are obsessed with cross examination than giving testimony Testimony first and then cross examination Throw terms of reference on his face DCJ Please @Barbara Sattler Anyone applying for cross examination before testifying usually are dodgy characters No cross examination will help Tugwana. Lead investigator is on point @Sal SA jeeeessssseeeeeessss lets go already Sal SA irritating to the core jeeeerrrr Rule 11.3 Every application musy follow a particular format @Barbara Even if it means in the evening like Makhubele yesterday.
