Felix Muyoba,@Chiang Mai Springbok increase your decibels to 30 @Sipho Mkize are you on campaigning trail? @Sipho Mkize then you have a pseudo name.. @Val Speirs there I agree with you when there is a leadership vacuum thats what happen..during mandela & mbeki the leadership was strong @Val Speirs no man..there i disagree..comrade means friends @Michael Michael they were channeling the money to themselves (bonuses) then theres no money to service power stations @Val Speirs no man..there was no terrorists..there were freedom fighters @Desmond Masilela let him spill the beans so that we finish connecting all the dots! "@Val Speirs terrorists to you but to us they were freedom fighters @Desmond Masilela imagine how many days our friend agrizzi tesified.. @Val Speirs with his matric qualification? "@Desmond Masilela hahaha @x. .x keep on dreaming "@x. .x you want homelands again "@Val Speirs and @x. .x this is africa not america..here it cant work @Val Speirs when you put borders around towns it means you control movement of people in and out of the town..is that what you want? @x. .x then join EFF @Michael Michael he must be a naturalised south african of indian origin @Michael Michael not sure either but it might be that the first thing is voluntary and if people dont come then they will be forced..not sure problem is that those big fishes control the state machnieries thats why they hard targets @Michael Michael correct or you disappear from the face of the earth @Planeless Pilot thats what I suspect..your are right
flightposit,sound
Desmond Masilela,SABC sound please The man is tired now. @Felix Muyoba. His tired he might make mistake now. @Felix Muyoba. Yes I do. But Agrizz is strong than this guys. His got big tommy remember? @Michael Michael. LOL what about this witness? @Felix Muyoba. LOL @Michael Michael. Yes i trust this man. But he looks exhausted. @Michael Michael. Exactly. The the coach do replace the player with other player. So let the guy go rest now. will come tomorrow. @Michael Michael. dont you think there will be sitting Friday? @Michael Michael. Lets wait and see. @Michael Michael. All these ppl that are implicated to this. The chair will subpoena them. "@Michael Michael. Do you think we might leave the big fish and to hear what lies his going to tell the commission? Gigaba not to hear @Michael Michael. Myself i just great them nicely @Michael Michael. I need the big one. Shark🐋🐋 Guy trust me. All these guys that are implicated to this. They will just be charged and pay fine thats. NO one will be arrested and put in Jail. trust me. 20 thousand rand fine. @Derek Main. Jail is made for me and you. If you dont have money you straight to jail. But if you have money they find you guilty and you have fine to pay. you go straight to jail @Derek Main. So this is just a waste of time. If its true something might happen. Why cant they start charging this ppl that are implicated. You become a suspect of killing someone they come and take you put in you in jail until you become clear. What is the different between this implicated once. Let them start with the process of filling court papers let the court start to do with its duty. @Derek Main. For almost 10yrs we heard about Guptas. No one has taken action against them. The Guptas did not use any Airport to leave SA. They used OR tambo. Why didnt they stop them from leaving SA? because they where under investigation. @Thando Nkutha. The chair ask for short break untill 16:00pm should be back soon. @Thando Nkutha. Not that 100% sure. But they knew they where gonna leave SA @Thando Nkutha. You welcome. @Thando Nkutha. Early when because this allegation started long ago. @Thando Nkutha. There's no smoke without fire. @Thando Nkutha 😂😂😂😂 I rest my case. I lost the battle. On that one you right. @Thando Nkutha. These ppl there where all over us. @Thando Nkutha 😂😂😂 After he meet the Gupta his head started growing non-stop. @Thando Nkutha. They got ubaba. Lucky not me. I know my father.
Born free,he is playing it down he is involved in the Guitars support. A man with no backbone. Gupta's yes well he could have made this public then I have watched from the beginning and just what constitues slander? They could have united and done something I never said he is Lying be factual I could be yes which means he is spineless Thank-you Micheal Darwin's theory is not accurate. I don't believe in his theory yes Micheal so true Most who have worked for State entities are corrupt Major corruption began when Zuma became President. Very true because Zuma has no intelligence .So his ministers and comrades did as Zuma did. I know corruption has always taken place but my goodness nor on a scale such as this. Not only Zuma but the ANC comrades Comrades is a communist term Comrade was used in Cuba when terrorists from Africa were trained in Communist Cuba. They were Terrorists trained by the communist Cubans and Russia Must vote wisely you don't want this country to become a Marxist state like Zimbabwe was under Mugabe who was another terrorist but fortunately for him he was educated in London. I am voting for John Steenhuizen x x great idea much like America There is no harm in trying and it is not like homelands it is a more efficient way of governance and accountability. nope I didn't suggest borders someone else did.
Magda Seguin,Total nonsense @Val Spiers This man and his entire board was sacked to make way for the Gupta captured under Lyn Brown You know mothing about the dynamic of state capture...so desist from making slanderous comments You obviously never listened as to how many people were harrassed and got death threats Saying that he is lying Really? so you are the judge and jury of state capture now...WOW its a first You said ge has no backbone...proof much...tell us if you have knowledge you add no intelligent convo here blocked I really suffer fools very badly Trolls having a field day @Michael it will be nice tto have the real ANC cadres who are implicated arrested...ie the ministers who followed Gupta orders...that will be a great start but now they are on the list for parliament All those implicated in the Bosasa theft are still free and laughing at tgeir compatriots...Koko is a case in point "@Michael the majority of the people who appeared up till now came forward on their own...they were not subpoenaed...the real culprits have not appeared yet...where is Duduzane I have come to the conclusion that most commenters on this forum never read anything that is already in the public domain about state capture...they comment as if everyone here is a crook The PMFA already showed that VR Laser was a shelf company so Stefan Burger is looking for a scapegoat @Makhosi definitely treason violating his oathvof office South Africa was handed on a platter to the Guptas by Zuma Lyn Brown masterminded the decline of Denel..leaving it in tatters and brilliant minds sacked...those people are now headhunted overseas for their expertise Koko did the same to Eskom... And Moyane did it at SARS too... Dudu at SAA....the list goes on Nine wasted years Anyone under 35 do not even have lived experience yet....it will be chaos...some cant even read and understand an Act of government Judging from what I see on Twitter under 35's are will never be able to govern... @x.x I said most not all...I know brilliant under 35's bit they are only starting out in their careers and is not interested in politics @Derek Main 😁 yes and what about the fashions I hope that they will be subpoenaed...maybe after Agrizzi testifies again later...I would love to see Mokonyane's denials "You are right The new board that was put there by the Guptas In what universe are we living with Lyn Brown 'not being that bad'? She sacked a brilliant board and replaced them with Gupta lackeys who destroyed Denel...catch a wakeup! Lyn Brown's partner recieved a 4x4 from the Guptas...her son in law was also involved in the SARS debacle with van Rooyens appointment as an 'advisor' "Gigabavis in trouble with the Gupta naturalisation Koko is very active on Twitter...he is blaming everyone but himself What he is explaining is what is defined in the World Bank 2001 State Capture document.. State Capture didn't start in South Africa it is a global political phenomena I encourage you to read Naomi Klein's book called 'Shock Doctrine' True they absolutely did @ Derek Main Honest people's lives was ruined... This was a MO throughout state capture...resign or suspend immediatly Totally against labour law Is 3 months salary a golden handshake? Labour LAW.... In SA we have the BCEA...Basic conditions of employment act...read it...we also have a labour court I understand @Robert Russell it was a free for all...state capture anarchy Sloppiness in their criminality We may end up with a coalition government Bring hulle in M'Lord Attorneys cost money and with 3months salary it's not possible to litigate At national level a coalition may work...we had a national coalition government before I doubt that the ANC will be completely out...too many diehard voters The ANC destroyed the country...future generations will judge us harshly Sad thing is...a lot of youth are believing in the EFF...another doomed party The DA need ethical guidelines...we never know what they are planning inhouse True @Ben ....I was referring to the historical perspective In some countries the streets would have been full of dissent but we have become numb with trauma "The ANC and EFF always blame colonialism This commission is at least giving some a chance to vent and relate their experiences.Judge Zondo's report will have to be concise and lead to arrests Lyn Brown promised him another 5 year contract then fired him....disgusting She has no moral compass His contract was already over in any case @Michael it runs very deep at all levels in government Batho Pale my foot It is so painful but the heartless ANC will deny they did anything wrong...just watch how arrogant they are in parliament The CCMA outcome was not favourable...it should have gone to the Labour court or even civil court All these people need debriefing and counselling with reparations Planeless Pilot has no humanity or compassion I think so too @Ben right now people are blaming Gordhan and the Eskom CEO for load shedding forgetting the huge damage Zuma and the Guptas did

makhosi nobhatyi,Gupta see this guy sallooge doesn’t shake they went to mr Burger "@Anne M this people to me were too greedy and had no money Magda Seguin I agreed with you problem was Zuma to be honest "Derek main Zuma make it worse than b4 Mr mbeki was trying to fight this behavior during his term "Derek main this is clear let heat the head first connect the dots were in trouble Derek main I disagree with totally you cannot vote out Anc because the act of individuals putting ANC in disputes "Transnet is coming "Derek main I understand now where are you up to "😃😃😀 Derek main South Africa know that ANC is the party that presents their cry other parties just cut and paste "Zuma saw that there are people who noticed what he did "Mahumapelo brother 😳😳😳 that is why denel paid mahumapelo’s son 1 million bursary 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ tjoo "Big fishes to all SoE Zuma "Gigaba is facings huge problematic he created "Magda Seguin he did answer but he thinks parliament was going to entertain him he couldn’t be able to make sense in wat he was approved for I would suggest everyone please don’t go Indian restaurant and bar holding executives positions in government others you do things like these 🤦‍♀️😀😃 Load shedding
Esmé Herbst,it seems to me that the sound is always softer in the afternoon than in the mornings. I really struggle to hear what is being said
Ntombethemba Manase,Is Ntshebe a surname? "Watch again Me too Thando. I only watched part2. Its very interesting. Michael bazawuza berhuqwa yingalo yomthetho. Lynn Brown was not that bad. My bad.I can see now that she did not mean it when she said the new board must not interfere with the work of the executive. "To think of us "Cherly Carolous @ Thando
Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Not only Zuma @makhosi nobhatyi What I am saying is that there are many others who are just as corrupt as Zuma who are still in government. @Val Speirs One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter. @makhosi nobhatyi The easiest way to get rid of as many corrupt people in government as possible is to vote out the ANC. @makhosi nobhatyi At least you're no longer saying it was just Zuma. The problem is that the ANC has so many corrupt individuals that they have tainted the entire party. @makhosi nobhatyi It could be said that the ANC appears to be a party that attracts corrupt individuals. @makhosi nobhatyi Well done but I have made no secret of that - the best thing for SA's future is to get rid of the ANC. "@makhosi nobhatyi Aaah - so you're back to ""only Zuma is corrupt"". All thinking SAfns can see that that is not true - the entire ANC has been corrupted." @x. .x Anyone under 35 can't get off their cellphones long enough to run a government. @Peter Staffen Yep - and the entire ANC was rotten long ago - now it is decomposing. @Michael Michael Yes - they will be summonsed. @Desmond Masilela I'm afraid you might be right. @Magda Seguin No surprises there - Koko has shown himself to be a bold-faced liar. @Desmond Masilela Too true - justice is for the rich. @Desmond Masilela Not sure why - I suppose they need to un-capture the NPA first. @Magda Seguin Zuma and the ANC just perfected it.

NPA heads ...can't recall the names *th *them they had no respect for ANY law is what I was alluding to Without a doubt...makes one sick to see where we have landed up.... and the scary thing is that we are going to land up with ANOTHER 5 years of ANC acceptance of this behavior.. normalized by the ANC He was debarred ..... goes to show who Zuma keeps as company now doesn't it ?
nicci wessels,Why don’t they just say that Brown interfered???
Nelson Musoliwa,The guptas enjoyed the support from the highest office in the land their jet landing at national key point bears testimony to this
Richardt Human,Afraid for losing his job and kept quite Yesterday the other guy said that VRLaser only wanted the Denel blueprints. They had no manufacturing capability. Only want to sell South Africa IP to other people. Judge Zono doing a veeeeery nice job. Need to go into action now and lockup a few culprits. Magda Seguin absolutely "The promise was made on the Friday in London She was manipulated seriously. "Stay at home This guy was a CEO. He had no guts to stand up for himself and now come to the commission to complain that the was treated unfairly. Mbalula on Friday. Going to be interesting.

Mogwape Mogwape,"vote ANC OUT "our children will be crossing borders in the near future to go and look for refuge "ANC think we owe them
Diana Sekatane,The problem is most of the voters are not that much aware of what their beloved organization is doing. We are in serious trouble. That is the work of a shadow state to place stodges at strategic places so as to loot and enrich themselves and their cronies. They don't care about the so called ' our people'. correct. They are pulling the wool out of the eyes of those who follow them. Taking advantage of the poor people who just believe what ever lies and promises for 25 years.
