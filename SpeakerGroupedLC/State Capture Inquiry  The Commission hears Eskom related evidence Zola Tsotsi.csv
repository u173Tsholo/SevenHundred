Ndumie Ndlovu,why Tsotsi coming when there's Molefe Tsotsi must right an Affidavit what's wrong with ANC receiving money from business ppl... who funds DA? "it wrong these retailers to do business in our township but contributes nothing in youth development but they take that money n fund white kids.. Spar @mumbi Banda you mean to tell in Western Cape it doesn't happened? @Lerato moleke one day when I'm in Joburgh "we should judge our own when they've done wrong.. for what you did all over the world "@jabu Malinga u ryt they should but the white men taught us to be selfish not to care about another black men.. thru Propagganda they must give back to our community but one day those clever blacks will wakeup and see the pain of being a black man in the white as honourable Minister Louise Farrakhan says @jaco Botha they can't bcs intelligence Zuma spoke about makes it impossible for any leader to move. who is really running this country? why to kill black miners forR12500 n no one goes to jail why? @louis C I don't understand where you get the impression that I'm waiting for handout? "@jabu Malinga they kill anyone who wants to succeed without the WMC involvement we are trying the impossible to be friends with the white men.. no one in the whole world ever since his excistance succeeded in doing that and we think just bcs he has allowed u. to corruption must stop and we must prioritise education.. agriculture and science.. we must feed ourselves not to wait for a white men to feed us.. "BLF Zuma's crime he allowed black people in the economy and the WMC is not happy.. they don't want to share.. no one in the has lived peacefully with them @bonke 247 I don't understand your anger.. were you angry when whites stole everything from us? what was your contribution to show your anger? crime is a crime and must not target black business and the whites are smiling to the bank @NN no why? @NN not me brother never been there some of us love our ppl we take monthly salaries to make a contribution within our community 99% of non blacks don't understand the pain our people are in and they rather do drugs or alcohol to ignore the pain of being non productive.. bcs opportunities are closed for ordinary black ppl @bonke 247 most ppl say black ppl are lazy . where you got that from.. who's working in the mines? who's doing the physical work in construction companies.. now you call them lazy when they are bosses "@Julie petersen I'm not disputing what you say however @styx Ndlovo wena uyagula ngekhanda... you don't care about the black ppls pain if no whites companies are here please end this commission ironically the Western Cape judiciary looks more fair than any other hence the WMC gunning the Judge President Hlophe @Pastor JJ I didn't know u know ppl I know🤔 Judge Hlophe can't be captured like those bias police in Western Cape.. who don't treat ppl equal.. @Pastor JJ u may not take me serious but take what I say serious because it the Truth @Pastor JJ by him doing what? but Western Cape Judges follow the law they don't follow their heart and political alignment @Pastor JJ let agree to disagree @Pastor JJ because that what the WMC does discredit those they can't control classify them as corrupt.. I'm sure as a pastor you familiar with the story of Jesus. they said he was a thief etc @Pastor JJ he tried corrupting them? how much he offered them? don't lie in public I will take it you just saying with no proof @Pastor JJ but I'm still impressed with the Western Cape judiciary.. they look fair for now @Pastor JJ now I get it you grew up knowing white is right .. we are different generation.. Malema/Mngxitama generation.. we want economic freedom in our lifetime @antoinette Meyer your problem is? have I said anything wrong? @Pastor JJ woodwork for what? this education system is meant to keep us as modern slave.. Bill Gates didn't finish his degree 🇿🇦
John Everitt,A Somewhat Harsh Observation : After Watching Yesterday's Proceedings; Its Unfair To Ask Elderly; Learned Mr. Soni To Perform For Hours On End .. He Became Heavily Fatigued and Made Several Mistakes ! A Question : With Oom Tito Stating Clearly That NO More Funds Will Be Released To This Important n Now Extended Commission ( But Throws BILLIONS At Dead-Dodo SAA ); Where / How Will Funds Be Secured ? Crowd-Funding : Tk U. That Is EXACTLY What I Was Considering. I Would Certainly Contribute ! To Me; This ( Petty ) Move Is An Absolute INSULT To Justice Zondo When Funds Are Directed To Wasteful SOE's REF : * No More Funding * For The Commission; I See That SAA Has Juss Asked For ANOTHER R 3.5 Billion; This Being Over n Above The Recent R 10 Billion ... And All The Other Multi-Billion Bail-Outs ! Is It Not Amazing How The EKSDOM Lahnees All Sitting Around A Table In The Same Meeting Each Have COMPLETELY Different Views As To What Was Discussed; Let Alone The Written Word : * He Said/She Said *
zip reeper,where are the wags with their bons mots this morning "heather mowing the lawn this morning you'll miss those snaking queues one day when everything has come to a halt auswell is the tall trains guy who gave ANC r80m?

Moonchild,Morning 🙂  Eskom-related evidence today GM @Teunis van Ree 🙂  "@Ngwetoh Wanka - wow I like Mr Seleka too but I do like all the EL's though 🙂  "Poor DCJ @Rene Ngwenya - true! @sidney nsibande - exactly! Who are they trying to kid? They think we are all stupid & fall for their lies. @Rubin Naidoo - you worshipped cadres?? Are they not normal people like us? If you put people on a pedastal you are bound to be disappointed. @Rubin Naidoo Times have changed dramatically & hope you have moved on from that thinking & see the ANC for what they are - corrupt patronage network of connected cadres who have stolen from the poor. "Wow @Valencia J 🤣😂😅  Shows the level of intelligence! All the comrades on the payroll & working together to hollow out Eskom How could he send a list directly from Saleem Essa knowing that the intention was to put people on the committees to enable State Capture? Surely that is a criminal offense?? Poor Mr Seleka keeps getting interrupted by DCJ! Have a happy #VoetsekANC Friday @Previous Nkopodi 🙂  Well said @Jabu Malinga - well done @Pravin Ghordan communist @N N - list of board & committee members according to what Saleem Essa & the Guptas instructed. Pleasure @Gasela Zwezwe - no I think it is imperative that all this vast corruption is exposed to the country so that we know what we've been dealing with. We then have to put pressure on the NPAto prosecute. 👍 let's see what the NPA does now as they have hardly done anything since Shamila Batoyi has taken over @Gasela Zwezwe  DCJ is correct in his deductions although we all know Lynne Brown is a hugely corrupt individual but Tsotsi has no proof that she was in cohoots with the Guptas & Essa. "Hope they are calling Lynne Brown back as well as all the other corrupt board & committee members. Romeo Khumalo must come testify "@Heather Durr - yes I do remember her being there but probably just answered ""Chair @N N - no I like him too 🙂 but I feel it interrupts Mr Seleka a bit too much & doesn't give him a chance to lead his evidence. * he interrupts @N N - ha ha 🙂 for sure!
Kevin1,GM all "former Board Chairperson at Eskom @Heather Durr Hi H @Heather Durr just use H as i am lazy to type your looonnnggg name (lol) @Teunis van Ree Hi Teunis Pleased Adv Seleka is back - i like him Looks as if everyone being having fun here today - enjoy *been enjoy weekend - to all

Heather Durr,@Kevin W @zip reeper Hi there @Teunis van Ree Hi there @Kevin W How do you know that H is my nickname with colleagues @Kevin W That is one heck of co-incidence. Kept me up at night 🙂 Morning all bunnies-is the aircon off I see the hunky EL wiping his brow @Anne M. Hi there-Kate will be back-I watched Gorillas in the Mist and Kate looks just like Sigourney Weaver and has the personality of Weaver in the Sci Fi movie Alien Oi Koko clearly has a thing about the emails and Daniels. I trust the Comm prints out his tweets as he just cannot keep quiet OK the aircon is off @Stix Mtolo Judge Hlope yes he said he had problems with that early on-I think its Hlope "Mr T looks terrified DCJ must treat him the same as all the others EL. I find it distressing *other @FieliesSA Hey there The witnesses incl Brian Molefe have now realised that denying knowing Essa or Guptas gets them into trouble I try to explain to everyone how utterly insignificant that 'error' of the EL's was and only a Basiri lawyer would raise it Tsotsi looks like me having a panic attack Looooooooooooool Yes say her name  It will help DCJ if you stop interrupting  Oh for heavens sake Has Adv Seleka got a chair to wait on And now it is tea time. DCJ is most challenging Ooops Oh just go to tea please OUTA just posted emails from Koko Cover Note 'Our submission wasn't taken into account. But your tweets should be. Along with the mails and Eskom docs you forwarded to Gupta lieutenant Chawla @Naledi Barron Hey there. DCJ being challenging again today @Mangalani Mangalani Kokos Twitter account Subtle hint to DCJ  @Lerato Moleke That system is profoundly flawed having spent months to book a app for renewal of my drivers license  @Moonchild Was Brown ever there-She caused chaos @Naledi Barron He is being obstreperous  @Lerato Moleke Hopefully the lines are moving now. I stood in a queue for 5 hours notwithstanding an appointment but that was at Randburg @Lerato Moleke Unfortunately not for divers license renewal at Randburg. You need to go in personally as they may need to check your eyes if you don have a acceptable/cert from an optometrist  *drivers Excuse the spelling. I fell pretty ba ly Wednesday night and am now sore and in shock I think *badly "@Lerato Moleke Oh no Are they still on this point So who owned the helicopter that flew 'dignitaries' to Nkandla Not the one funded by Prasa? Oh dear thunderstorms it appears Is the picture breaking up for all Is this guy being less than truthful as being so verbose and so full of excuses does not engender trust @Lorna Kavanagh It is here-that storm Well that's telling him Adv Seleka-you go for it 31 years-lets hope he stays in that long "Hi all-that Ndumie guy comes with all of the usual RET narratives @Pastor J.J Hi there holy one Wow what a storm-cars being washed off the roads in Benoni-hail balls  My Federer has come to me for protection-he is petrified by the noise and rain-nice to know I do like to mother animals @Diane Louw He is sitting on my head so......... @Diane Louw OUTA has him in a corner and he is pleading 'Kokohunt'-he pretty much painted himself into a corner Mkize speaking on corruption allegations against Health Department not him Oh no did Koko just phone you Did you just pull him out from under the bus Ok you threw him under the train DCJ you just said Adv Seleka must proceed Ugh Ugh Poser on TV again DCJ go back to the bar if you want to x examine please "@Dan Brown Hi there 'The Peoples President' ugh That is why it takes so long-DCJ interrupts each train of thought leading to a particular point and we go back and round again If DCJ would stop interrupting I would by now have understood what happened that weekend and what the issues are-I am totally confused @Antoinette Meyer Its one of the 3 standard RET excuses-funded by White Monopoly Capital or Stellenbosch for short This is not correct subject for re-exam The inference is to be drawn by DCJ not subject to re-exam No no no nope He has given his version. THATS IT This is not a civil or criminal court No second bite at the cherry on a point that is highly relevant and now he is changing his version @Msizi Masikane @Pastor J.J Actually its sub judice You see now you are in the dwang thanx to the rexam Ugh man now you see Mr Cute Mbanjwa oh dearie LOLOLOL Oh dear LOOOOOOL @Antoinette Meyer  @Stix Mtolo Well I am an experienced attorney 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh Too funny LOLOLOLOLOL Fire your lawyer Mr T Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh It matters a lot esp next week "@Antoinette Meyer 'Next week some of the alleged biggest players in state capture and corruption

Anne M.,I don't think so @khuthadzo moji . I think there are still a couple of witnesses for SAA. Ha ha ha @Heather Durr I agree with the personality of Weaver in Alien similarity. @Jabu Malinga Pretoria High Court has approved the commission's extension until June because of Covid lockdown last year. @Lerato Moleke Who is the judge? Agree @Martha Sello  "I'm sorry Can the NPA appeal the decision? @Walter Moloto  Thanks @Walter Moloto . I hope they do. Great one @FieliesSA 😂 It used to be called Kings House @Diane Louw and is now used for visiting heads of state or for the president a place to stay when he's in Durban. Suzanne Daniels
Arthur Kona,DCJ must make recommendations about what punishment for those who are found guilty for deliriction of duty. Problem is that there is no consequence management for inaction or unlawful action

If “over scrupulous” yes But i am referring to his concern to “minor details” Documents presented to president are reports Zondo is the reason why this commission is behind schedule  "He talks slowly @Victor I watched TRC & PIC and others. The chairmen were very firm and straight to the point.

You are also missed Diane @Heather Durr Greetings my Dearest Heather. Hopefully the ovaries are behaving today. @Diane Louw Nothing unexpected.

But we need to keep moving forward. @Rene Ngwenya I swear those numbers challenged me and I can imagine the difficulty for uBaba @Ndumie Ndlovu I do Bro @Ndumie Ndlovu The same Hlophe that tried to capture the Concourt Judges? @Naledi Barron I saw that @Ndumie Ndlovu I always give you the benefit of doubt bro but sometimes your comments are just too farfetched @Ndumie Ndlovu Hlophe is currently known to be the most untrustworthy Judge. How do you see it differently. I challenge one person on the chat to agree with you. @Naledi Barron I am on top of it with my Doom in hand @Ndumie Ndlovu But Hlophe tried to corrupt the 2 Concourt Judges to favour Zuma. Dont you see that Bro? @Msizi Masikane His behaviour albeit bad is well documented in Affidavits from 17 Judges sitting under his Presidency. I rest my case @Ndumie Ndlovu Like you said. Lets agree to disagree. I am sure you have your reasons. @Msizi Masikane We can engage each other respectfully. I am sure of that. The Proof is with the JSC.  @Ndumie Ndlovu I am an old man now with certain limitations which seems to have reach the point where I must say I rest my case.

Dan Brown,@Heather Durr - Hello There @Heather Durr - I Tend to Lurk a lot as I am working on many screens at once and only contribute when I am doing a Job boring like watching the paint dry. 😊 This Guy is a smoothie at the commission total antithesis of what all the other witnesses describe him in meetings. DCJ is also too friendly with him. The EL is toothless too. Bring Kate back. Nick Lanelle is another smooth Spin Doctor as well IMHO. Even Mr Sony 📼😂 Yesterday had more gutzpah ! "He's a lovely guy but too Jovial with some witnesses IMHO It seems a lot of Eskom people communicated via ESP as they all have a different story. I bet a lot of Minutes of meetings were either not taken or disappeared. I Don't even know how DCJ follows all these independent threads.  "If Uncle Ray took Notes @Heather Durr - I concur. I think there is over a Million Pages of Evidence so far - Anyone know? "Of course Dudu Myeni was just 2000 pages of cut and paste "" I am not answering that question for fear of incriminating myself""" I wouldn't like to be standing on my feet for all those hours like these Legal Eagles do I believe the Lady that went and met the Scruffily Clad Gupta in his Tracksuit and sweaty shirt at the Michaelangelo "Semantics "Whackhead is funny but sounds like he is still in puberty Judge President Hlophe is a nasty piece of work.
