Can you write proper English @Wallace She is my niece...lay off the lawyer @Wallace...you write 'dat' instead of 'that You are insulting me @Wallace...my surname is SEGUIN ...messing with a person's name is insulting And don't call me stupid...you don't know me Yes I will @Sofia Sofia I blocked him already @goolamv thanks "Most people on this thread are decent @Sofia Sofia..normally they are a team "I was away for a few minutes Thanks @Anne M "Mbeki studied economics at Sussex University...during his tenure SARS collected the best revenue "The details are always boring but necessary That is when you do your bosses work and neglect your own work Mrwebi and Jobs was paid to make the Bosasa case go away *Jiba "Looking back on the 9 wasted Zuma years it was Zuma We are witnessing the history if the fall of our democracy...it will be there for future generations to look back in disgust @Peter pott...it is people like her who are often taken advantage of and victimised She is obviously passionate about her work even going so far as to write letters for her boss that puts their signature on the letter...I've been there believe me it's called being used "I always say that bosses are not the leaders Mwrebi Mrwebi and Jiba was the director and and deputy director @Peter pott...it is very painful and traumatic as they can just ask you to leave for no reason...they get threatened by your knowledge "She appears to have emotional intelligence as well The judge seems tired...Im not surprised He must be careful of burnout..Mr Pretorious as well @L L you are right...doctors spend less than 15 min. with a patient...nurses are there round the clock...up to 12 hours at a time "@Anne M *Jiba @welton paulse the weekend us still far away "Mr Ramathlodi was an excellent witness "As a senior prosecutor she should have had her own PA @Albert Noah I can see that Mr Agrizzi is sincere hence he is not scared to die.I believe he gave all the evidence he has If Agrizzi goes to prison he will probably die there Mr Pretorious has a very illustrious struggle past He was an anti apartheid campaigner @peter pott just for everybody's info that's all There have been such a lot of race bashing on this thread I thought some should be educated that not all whites agreed with apartheid @Peter pott...you should see the English with their racist comments which are far far worse on the Brexit threads I watch on euronews "The British call immigrants and people from Africa "I love South Africa and in spite of racism from the EFF and BLF No @Zamo...I don't engage about colonialism...it was evil but Africa is free now.African leaders are oppressing their own people staying in power for 30 to 40vyears enriching themselves "I travelled all over Africa and lived in Aim and Botswana *Zimbabwe "In comparison The witness is getting quite agitated now Your bosses was giving it to Watson the scoundrels Dudu Myeni They were a cabal of corrupt thieves Myeni may have received it from Jobs who knows? It may still be revealed..they are a mafia that has a sly MO to divert attention *Jiba "@Peter pott...Cyril is appearing to be weak "Fact is "@Peter pott true "This witness testimony is at the heart of NPA corruption @Yin Yang I am not a proponent of civil unrest but we can march in millions like the Venezuelans to bring the government down When the lights go out after the elections people may be fed up enough...The economy is in crisis and more blackouts will be the tipping point @Yin Yang it can be spontaneous too but I hear you "This witness have invaluable evidence The French revolution was started by The people themselves I was wondering why Batohi is focusing on The KZN killings instead of Bosasa She has the power to have Watson arrested asap @Peter pott...I don't trust anyone in the ANC at all....you are correct Haibo...Jesse Duarte just said that the ANC won't be influenced by the bias of the media!!! I switched phones and the first thing that popped up is her face...She says the ANC will not select people to be subjected to scrutiny Another hero we were not aware of....honest and diligent @Robert Russell the ANC corruption runs very deep rightcdown to branches and municipalities... somevof the VBS money came from illegal investments by municipalities "No Judge We can set up a concerned citizens interim government There are great civil society NGOs that have great minds and true patriotism "Mabuza is already preparing himself "Yes Lekota is pals with Steve Hofmeyer..I don't trust his friendship with rightwingers I am very impressed with the DA in Gauteng...they turned around billions of debt in the past few years and rooted out corruption Vote for Cope at your peril...all I'm saying

Judge wants a Pee he will go wash his face to wake up a little. ha ha Cameron you a quota kid. dad wanted a smart one. but your mom presented you. depends what you call a privileged kid I was born dumb so not sure that classified me as privileged. but over time I learnt to use maths and work out 1+1=2 and if you try turn one of the 1s into a 5 you are cheating and go to jail. you think she is boring. but listen to how well she worked. and safe guarding the work that she did. does not matter what she/he looks like as long as they have the evidence that will bring down the clowns Abel I agree my ID book still has that address on. Flats in Sun City years back. it's hard copies which will bring Bosasa down. true Ann Anne Snake and Snail are finished once this lady is done. Zonda will order them out of the other commission does not. they had all this data and did nothing. yes she made sure all data was backed up and saved she knows here stuff Kim are you Chines working in Europe or born there. Snake shot. bang gone failed in her tasks it's the borderline that went to the next page she could be the NPA head. and teach others. with what she knows Zonda is a smart man. so much will need to change. ANC out. new government will need to ask people to change there attitude towards tourists and welcome them in with open arms. fastest way to get money into the system. new border controls in place. There are thousands of jobs waiting if correct action is taken but no quick fix is possible. it will take time. lots of court cases to be held. a big leek in the NPA. yes Dudu at the hotel and Agrizi took the pics in the passageway Mabuza owe Putin Millions I do feel sorry for people who suffered 25 years ago. and then under the last 15 years under the last ANC leaders and now scared to vote in DA because the fears ANC and have instilled. no way back when they back.

Dr Matome Moloto TV,I assume comfort break is toilet break in legal or commission terms
Zamo Ngobese,@Michael Wild you are previldged kid. @Magda Seguin why not mention Zille and her colonialism. @Cameron Kim i like the way you put it. this eveidence leader is weak.
Thembisa Odendaal,@Cameron kim why are you so negative towards women shame it's very ugly all it does just exposes your very poor self image @ any given time lawyers deal with mega amounts of pages I have the greatest of respect for them ...endless reading I would have loved to be a lawyer love the argument and case law but can't deal Just want to say I know Agrizzi is s great skelm & this was a personal vendetta against Watson nevertheless he managed to take us into his confidence he deserves mercy from all of us i believe Agrizzi could be remorseful & rehabilitated but they must strip them of all the money from criminal means guyz we are in major trouble if we end up with dd mabuza there's no alternative @magda I can still deal with the arrogance but but ignorance I cannot deal with that Cyril is something else
Dominic Przybylski,Anyone who identifies themselves primarily by race is a racist. For the British race is a side issue. Class is what divides them just as much as race does here. Brexit is symptom of class war. Everyone has a right to their opinion. Even Zille Problem is that no political party has a credible alternative to ANC. DA just copies ANC. That's why they're called ANC-lite. We need a clearly articulated solution with a road-map of what is to be done when and what the outcome should be. "General population has lost hope and there isn't a vision of what we can work towards. With a background like that "We know who must be voted out DA in power will be even worse than ANC. At least ANC has its policies but DA has none except to say that they will do it better. I live in Cape Town @Magda Seguin. The DA's success is not a result of their own policies but is more due to the actual citizens who are very active and very upset by what DA is now doing. Same as a school which only accepts top qualifying students and claims they teach better than other schools. We need to spread power to the small moderate parties like COPE and ACDP. Hope lies in our own hands. Ain't anybody else who cares.
Solly 12,Who‚Äôs the witness people??? Philani Madlala who is she Shamila Batohi‚Äôs silence is getting louder & louder Cameron Kim you like drama Bantu refers to African people‚Äôs that came from the mid & central Africa Cameron Kim are you related to Kim Kardashian ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòé "If Agrizzi‚Äôs testimony does help to fix our country "Thembisa Odendaal I think he should be given another chance
Born free,No bonus No increase üò≠ What position does Dudu Myeni hold? We know Jiba was involved Top I am voting the ANC out They won't exist Russia assisted the ANC terrorists
Philani Madlala,She is boring a waste of data And she looks tired üòì She must have been too busy protecting Apartheid criminals shame üò¨ She look like she just gave birth to triplets üôÑüôÑüôÑ Can she be asked for qualifications I know these white like to fake qualifications these daysüôÑüôÑüôÑ She wasted state papers shameüôÑüôÑüôÑ "I think she is hungry This lady is so lazy look at her Can they at least hydrate her by giving her cold water üí¶
Prudence Nokuthula,why is it there
Fowzia Arnold,philani you are disrespectful & disgusting in your comments about women. why dont you watch days of our lives or some other soapies instead. as it appears you are an idiot
Robert Russell,@Magda Seguin ...agreed.... hard to believe that there are actually any honest people working in the ANC Government.... Oh I think we all know that.... hence the only way to get ourselves out of this corrupt mess is to vote the ANC out on the 8th.... even that might not be enough for the first 5 year term I'm afraid any one except the EFF and the BLF clowns.... @Netsport Talent Register ...100% agree with you yeah begging bowl hands @makhele lebona
Enrico Abrahams,apparently because the ANC saved south Africa from apartheid they all became entitled into taken(corruption) at the own will if they wanted to..
Gabisile Mabuza,Mr Agrizzi said he got the documents from Dudu Myeni at a specified hotel
Marietjie Larney,Only option is DA
Pigeons 911,I think the only option is Cope .The DA is arrogant .Lacota was the only Leader who are willing to stand for ALL South Africans Don't confuse a persons Love for his country as a sign of racism .
Mongezi Mati,next witness is Mr Dukwana
