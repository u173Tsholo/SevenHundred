After this is over im getting a kota with extra archer @Phillip..Yeah bra..Kotas are the best.. especially a Kota with cheese and extra archa and french!!! I think this entire state capture commission is an distraction How did Ramaphosa make so much money???.. Last i heard Ramaphosa is a billionaire i wonder when are they going to resume this commission?? ok cool its back on @Cerebis.. Evidence against who malema or floyd shavambu??? @Cerebis..I thought so @Cerebis..Im not a Malema fan by the way..But im just being objective here..If there is really evidence that he is guilty i would like to see it..Till then he is innocent! @Cerebis..Malema is more confused than anything..I have never seen a politician who flip flops like him.. Remember his position on the public protector and how he changed his mind @Thobela..Tsotsi means thug.. what kind of encounter? why put the mask on now? imagine if Zondo is on Zumas payroll..I would not be surprised @Simmy..Wig or weave..You mean weave???? @Simmy..You shouldn't admit that you need a weave..You should be decieving us with your hair that is a sistas golden rule @Simmy..He is already stupid..He cant get any dumber.. @Simmy i got tired of that weirdo talking about himself and behaving like he is Trump so i blocked him..Take my advice block that weirdo it seems the only country in the SADC region which is not corrupt is Botswana..The government has been considered squeaky clean @Cerebis it seems both Botswana and Namibia are stable countries unlike SA @Cerebis also.. Botswana has a low crime rate..Its so relaxed there @Cerebis..I heard its difficult to get a citizenship in Botswana..Im thinking of relocating there @Cerebis.. Are you aware that there is a rivarly between SA and Botswana??.It might be difficult for a South African to settle there @Cerebis ok im going there..Thanks for the info! "@Cerebis Australia??.wow..Thats nice..I heard the cost of living is high in Australia ANC is self destructing..Sadly they are taking the country with them to hell...I bet people wont vote them out next election.. My goodness she is still being questioned ??? :goodvibes: Tjo..Crazy people
L. M,"the commission deals with ""state capture"" and on the hand we dont know as who ""captured Khanyi`s heart" "i think the gender commission should invistigate for a settlement otherwise "@Handsome Boy you say you are ""sexy"" is it because you do lots and lots of sexual activities" @Naledi Barron thanks and i understand hey gusy you mean his alleged deeds follows with his surname? @Handsome Boy stop annoying Simmy and us here and Simmy dont entertain him
William Pieters,is this one of the guys wearing the white hat? for me Black Excellence is Mr Zondo what would the ANC have done if we still had Nukes? I new it. lol I was told in the 1980's that nothing would change in ZA except that there will be a different color on the gravy train.
Tommygun,"This guy is great "Wow @Thulani Faku lol "Wow All out looting and asset stripping No price was too high to remove them. He really is working with a pile of 5#1+ i CAN ALMOAST HEAR ALL THE DOTS BEING JOINED... oops "Look hard
Cerebis,Violent scenes have broken out at the Senekal Magistrate's Court when a group of angry farmers fired shots and burned a police vehicle in an attempt to storm the cells....Very worrying indeed. "I blocked the fake so called ""Pastor"" a while ago. It is just sad some on this chat actually believe his nonsense." @SanFran Arnold I agree with your view. He has ducked this issue for too long. @Mtokozisi Baleni Very fair comment. @Zakhele Gumede And he saw nothing in those 4 years. Watch this space he told us recently. I am watching and nothing is happening. "@R.m. B. It is so sad to say "@R.m. B. Most of South Africa hoped and prayed for that after 1994. We wanted to believe in the ""Rainbow Nation"" of Archbishop Tutu. Even he is now praying for the fall of the ANC. Sad hey?" "@Kopz Koape Nope @Kopz Koape Follow the money. "@Kopz Koape Agree on the issue with malema @Banele Masuku Hehe....but let's hear the evidence first? She might surprise us by being innocent of all charges? Why does the DCJ put his mask on for some witnesses? Or does he have some flu himself? Does he smell something bad? "@R.m. B. She was one of the suspended Directors and is giving evidence on those issues. I do not know her Why did she remain with the Molefe surname if they divorced I wonder? "Ohh also met Issa @Simmy Ndlovu Maybe he is to his special friend?? @Simmy Ndlovu I agree with you. He is unnecessarily hassling you. He must desist now. I think the DCJ is being responsible. He has a cough and only covers his mouth when he coughs? I never trusted Agrizzi. He came to the Commission as a known crook. He has a deal with the Commission I think.? @Handsome Boy You are getting abusive Honey. You need to stop now or I will report you for abusive action. You are plain stupid it would seem to me. @Kopz Koape Agree with you. Namibia is also not corrupt. "@Kopz Koape Jip. They are currently both ad hearing to their constitutions and are stable I blocked the Boy and his fake Pastor. Peaceful on my chat site. @Kopz Koape I know people who started doing business in Botswana. The Government does a lot to assist new business ventures. @Kopz Koape There is no problem to get Permanent residence in Botswana. The problem it would appear to be between a certain ANC minister's wife and elements in Botswana. "@Kopz Koape Wide open country "@Kopz Koape Jip. Housing is very expensive.

Hahaha! you need these straightforward people to run affairs of the nation. one would vouch for a to be the president of this nation? sukha wenna handsome boy. what is it with you I like her. she has a wonderful character. unshakeable I blocked too
Handsome Boy,I am obviously sexy I don't think that is in dispute.. @ Mike Clark Enews did the same thing and I think it is because of these snitches who report other people's comments! So no one is going to say how sexy I am? @ Mondli Nohashe yes so it seems like it is going to be an easy win for the defence team. Don't know why they appoint incompetent prosecutors for high profile cases like that one😬 @ Thobani Mkananda we need the prosecutor who is of the same calibre as the one who handled Oscar Pistorius case. Public Prosecutor and Ace Magushele are jolling. . @ wim louw so are you just going to ignore how sexy I am? Naledi Barron is quite an attention seeker. @ Annie Van Niekerk I wanna join that WhatsApp group and be the only sexy person. @ SaFran Anorld trying to be as sexy I am and failing at it. Is Goat here? @ SanFran Anorld I need to show you how sexy it feels to be me. Danie Nielsen looking like a model. . @ Danie Nilsen you do got an appeal of a model. @ Yolo Moore is too excited to be here... @ Danie Nilsen haven't you won Mr South Africa or something? @ Yolo More you seem happy to be texting on this stream. Like you would probably record this day in your diary. @ Thobani Mkananda maybe they should have appointed a white prosecutor on Tim Omotoso's trial😬 @ Danie Nilsen if you haven't won Mr South Africa title then South Africa is just simply jealous of you. @ Thobani Mkananda I need to leave. The world awaits my sexiness. @ Yolo More take care of @ Danie Nilsen while I am away. @ Yolo More the problem is SanFran Anorld is jealous of how sexy I am.. @ Danie Nilsen do you eat any curry? @ Yolo More because last time I spoke to @ SanFran Anorld she wanted me to leave the room because my sexiness was distracting the stream. @ Danie Nilsen you got an Indian wife? Wow UK education. . @ Danie Nilsen so you are a playa like Jacob Zuma? @ Danie Nilsen I think all these ladies are attracted to your model appeal. @ Danie Nilsen getting ladies at 61 is so gangster. Just because she isn't stuttering doesn't mean she is credible.. Credibility of a witness is determined by her or his performance under cross examination. You guys are just biased. . You don't even wait for her to be cross examined but she is already credible to you 😯 @ Pastor J. J is asking for an autograph. . @ Tshika Tshabeng there is lot of evidence that I am sexy. And the most compelling one is my face. @ Carmen James she is a witness? @ Carmen James do you think she got hidden agenda? @ Carmen James let me trust your judgment . @ Yolo More can we agree that this lady is distracted by how sexy I look? @ Carmen James I will definitely sue you for misleading me if I find out that you were lying ! @ Simmy Ndlovu isn't that too obvious? This is Brian Molefe's wife? @ Simmy Ndlovu have you ever seen someone as sexy as I am? I mean not even your weave gets you closer to look half as sexy as I am. @ Simmy Ndlovu because I am not wearing a weave like you? "@ Lian van den Heever be honest @ Simmy Ndlovu girls who wear weaves avoid getting into a fight because they know they will have it pulled out and get their balding head exposed. @ Simmy Ndlovu you do know my hair made that weave you are wearing right ? and this is the thanks I get😯 @ Simmy Ndlovu okay but the point is you aren't confident enough to show your real hair. @ Yolo More do you trust this lady giving evidence? Her story sounds rehearsed. . @ Simmy Ndlovu hmm chances are you are one those females with hair on their chest. @ Carmen James who is going to cross examine her? @ Simmy Ndlovu I know underneath that weave is Zondo's bald head. @ Carmen James if she is not going to be cross examined then we can't take her evidence seriously. @ Simmy Ndlovu sure thing and a little bird told me that you vacuum your weave. @ Yolo More yeah and @ Simmy Ndlovu is intimidated by my sexy looks. She definitely has a sour relationship with mirrors because she isn't impressed by what they reflect when she looks into them. Could be Venda. . @ Simmy Ndlovu what does my mother have to do with you wearing hair that doesn't naturally belong to you? @ SanFran Anorld I guess my sexy self should leave??.. @Yolo More thanks son. @Pastor J. J always poking his unwanted nose where it doesn't belong. @Cerebis I think I was fair when speaking ill against those who wear weaves but @Simmy Ndlovu started involving my mother and grandmother and none of you biased scumbags are saying anything about that @ SanFran and what do you have to say about @ Simmy Ndlovu insulting my mother and grandmother ? Biased much? I mean my mother and grandmother who mind you is no longer alive was dragged into this and insulted despite the fact that they both got nothing to do with this but the weave lady gets support 😑 @SanFran Anorld you are biased because you didn't tell that weave wearing lady to stop with the personal attacks dammit. Who was more personal between her and I?i never said anything about her mom. @Andre Gerber oh you also wear a weave .. @SanFran Anorld and you liked the comments she made about my mother and grandma huh? @SanFran Anorld I am so disappointed in you woman! been😠 I am son angry right now and I still look sexy even when I am angry. So! So very angry! The angrier I become the more sexy I look. @SanFran Anorld middle finger to you for being biased! @Thobani Mkananda my sexy looks are compatible with all platforms. When I leave nothing sexy will be left.

Nothing will be written about him. State Capture has targeted People unfortunetly it has cost us a Billon to bring them to court @Phillip Van Rensburg i think Zondo is safe. The real danger is these witnesses we see everyday here whos protecting them? its unbelievable what a mess these SOEs the politics of looters @Banele Masuku they were looking for a tsotsi to work with and loot
Zakhele Gumede,Mr Ramaphosa was there for 4 of the 9 years. Not saying he saw nothing. He actually was appointed when things were happening at both Eskom an SAA. And then he was sidelined. I remember JZ going to Medupi where he promised that LoadShedding was a thing of the past. He also went to SAA to a heroes welcome and promised that SAA was there to stay.
Lindani Moyo,@Zakhele Gumede Fair enough But he needs to account to some extent. Ramaphosa should have his day at the Zondo Commission It can't true that Ramaphosa did not have any dealings with the state? Where are you @Naledi Barron ? "@Naledi Barron Eish

Mokhuoaalexanda Molete,@Russia Mrs Molefe
Gift Mazibuko,State capture did not only damaged our SOE's it also destroyed a lot of careers. @ Carmen James- True dat.. It was on 702 Clement Manyathela show.. It is heart breaking that the very same looters of Eskom now want to dictate to Judge Zondo to recuse himself... "The last time I checked Romeo Khumalo was a radio metro DJ @Getrude Mthembo she is very fluent ... Eskom''s illegal suspension of these executives is very similar to the that of the SABC 8. Proof that state capture was a well planned systematic madness. It is no wonder why Zuma is up to his old tricks trying to evade the commission. "@sammy tlhapi ":Tsotsi "" is a township lingo for a thug She is very articulate and composed. I like her.. She was suspended for standing her grounds against Koko's looting spree..
Samuel Skosana,Can't wait for Zuma to appear here That will be a pity Buyani This lady cannot be corrupted. She does not need Escom to realise her ambition This lady cannot be corrupted! Clearly this lady is NOT corrupt
Val Speirs,Witnesses who are implicated in the looting don't require protection. I wish my hair was that straight 😁 Vultures
Phakamile Khuzwayo,"Ramaphosa knew that if he wanted to fight this corruption he must win
Gibrilla Faux,The day African politician will telling the truth that is the day we can rise

"Carmen Isn't it amazing how this witness can recount all of these events ? This deserves an Award! The insults aren't really necessary adults! She is part of the honest tribe!! You are 100% right Mondi!! This script sounds very familiar!! Utilised across the country to frustrate and get rid of credible people!! Hollow silence...and sheer arrogance in dealing with straight-forward professionals!! "if anyone had any doubt about how principled this lady is Romeo Khumalo needs to be called in to testify!!!
Mike Scott,Is That Treseme Hair?

Banele Masuku,Who hires someone called Tsotsi to be responsible for money? I trust no one. I remember I was once impressed by Agrizzi's testimony @Russia Magezi True. He told the truth alright but he was a crook. My point is she might be telling the truth but we don't know the whole story yet @Bonang Sithole Political Pressure??? He IS CORRUPT Slightly off topic: Is it true that the commission can't prosecute or convict anyone? @SanFran Arnold So we're basically watching a gossip show Thanks for the info fellas @Nemabubuni Geoffrey 😆.. Waay too much She will never be President of South Africa because she can't be bought @Steekmoer jr Let me play that jam R.m. B. 😆 Forget it. The people who are suppose to approve that BEE alternative are not educated. they can't pass a law that shoots them in the foot @R.m. B. She will only be given these small positions like CFO COO etc.. She will never be at the top of the pyramid. people who are placed there must be manipulated to fill someone's pockets "@R.m. B. she'd need funding and the Guptas @Sammy Tlhapi Unfortunately Uncle Zondo is busy asking them nicely and some have already blueticked him @Thobani Mkananda no comment😂
Lehlohonolo Moses,dnt ever hire a person with a surname of tsotsi.
Thobela Wem,lets see this... what does tsotsi mean in your language? 🤔🤔🤔 "so if tsotsi means the samething across all languages i really do not think she is corrupt... what do you think... @Essdie yeah i can see

Sihle Ngcobo,She is Telkom's CFO
Thulani Faku,This show why we have so much social ills on the ground level. These people are thieves mara. toothless dogs of the law the english ducth law is realy failing us. I vote for her we are hearing why we have loadshedding amongs many other scandals. And we are not wanting to deal with the problem. everyone's books from the last 26years should be open nyan. everyone. public and private. the chickens have come home to be deep fried. or should I say the curry has been eaten. @Lucky Mtshali dish mzala she has my vote she is already my Madam President we busy watching dstv n all other nonsense when we should be out in the streets. our women are not safe. everyone with power is just raping the country. makunyiwe. we are not ready for Msholozi. that's the boss. in this drama adventure thriller horror and science fiction. the boss comes at the end. Van damme Rambo type of scene. we are not ready in 2020 we are not. Its too epic competence straight competence. uright usisi and ubright. cause we want to know all the tv nonsense in the country should be stopped. and this should run for 24 7 loadshedding top billing lifestyle on people's blood. Satanism Cyril is also a vimpire. Dracula Romeo needs a smack from Sinyaka ja ne? the curry train. jezzz the capetown jazz festival u could see all these vimpires sucking blood. n the durban july @Cerebis I am not on trial. no comments alien covenant Ami Faku guy she is a leader I say this again. professional all the way. she so straight. no two beers the corruption scale is on red red red.

Lucky Benya,This one is here to set the record straight
Xolile Titus,Just joined. what position did she hold at Eskom and was she also in the list of those who were to be suspended? thanks guys for the heads up 🙏🏿 @Carmen James it looks like. I wonder if these people are happy with what they did to people's careers particularly Blacks. Now they come and talk RET whilst they've been this destructive @Xolani J. she's one of the board members so the President did not trust the work of the war room which was led by his then DP. Okay. The scramble for Eskom was really in motion so how much was Bowman paid for that dismissive letter to Ms Molefe. Am sure R100 000 just for that letter These law and accounting firms must also come and account for their conduct. Kebby Maphatsoe an opportunist of note. now they want to unleash MK bcoz Cyril is exposing corruption. Yes Zuma got them close bcoz he wanted them to keep quiet and enjoy corruption spoils Romeo must apologize to her. He's just sent to get her out of the way @ntokozo and confirm your discussions in writing via email.
