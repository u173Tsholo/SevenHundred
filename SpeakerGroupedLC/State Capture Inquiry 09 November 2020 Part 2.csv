Blake Yogi,Is it fake news that Myeni has been arrested? 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ I know they want her arrested but havent seen that she is. Unless its under wraps Are you in law Heather? Ok I saw the interview last night. Its on youtube they only laid a charge. Is that charge enough for an arrest? Its always amazing to ask a legal person stuff cos I feel sometimes we go by emotion and not what the law provides You had me rading twitter and all media houses looking for that arrest🤣🤣 I feel it is needed though. for the sake of whistle blowers But she wasnt apprehended into custody or in a jail/holding cell Ok I hear what you saying Heather she will have to go to court and answer like a criminal for the crime. Whether or not she hands herself in or not housekeeping @Deon bye @Teunis bye Pro actor Guys how can this be the same as Kate? it is not Kate. It is not SAA. This commission isnt limited like our likes and dislikes. Pls go watch replays or go play @Canis exactly @Makombe. dodgy dealings @Makombe it is Denel this week. Not SAA Mylife. same here. we should be studying 🤯🤯🤯 🤣🤣 @Fuzile may I not answer that requestn In case I incriminate myself @Naledi I have a 3 strike system. after the third message I block 🤣 Yas Mr Kennedy. Press him more cos I have never heard anything like this in my life 🤯🤯🤯 No competitors tender😱😱😱 @Rob block him Cos he will continue for attention very unfair he bana Hitler @Magesh🤣🤣 swept under the carpet:elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: 🤣🤣🤣 rot under that carpet. Deep corruption goin on there but people dont care cos it isnt sensational but the crime is similar. irregular to the core this is shocking 🤯🤯🤯 A sham "Just because the evidence leader and witness are calm @Naledi ameni bo @Naledi if you go for the curry. dont do it in SAA cos you wont be able to live with yourself once Kate gets hold of u Mr Kennedy it is so crucial and essential @roberto log off cos we aint hearing the same thing unless you not understanding or seeking drama he bana this guy is going to jail mos. Keep confessing baba🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ haaibi Bhekie. Didnt you hear what he is saying This isnt black white cos in this commission the corruption has been throughout. @Heather u need to see someone gurl Heather J. not D @Rene the part of corruption that makes it more disgusting. We all say to uplift black people but put a corrupt one and the professional black is left wanting while the poor get ripped off more @Naledi 🤣🤣 mine is practical exam tomorrow. 3pm to 430pm @Naledi previous witness done @BanditZA listen to the questions and what answers this man is giving "But no enquiries since 2012. As a CEO zero action. Just say oh ok A CEO isnt a general worker. There is high accountability why is it that you cant link that doing nothing is just as bad as being corrupt Exactly Chair. You are emphasizing the point Im making here. "@Jabu you should be cos you are an accomplise. If you didnt open to see what you are delivering Exactly If you are useless for a job get out. I am also feeling DCJ and battling to understand those that dont see why. Maybe its cos I have been following many parts of this commission Agrizzi has received bail but in ICU in hospital @Naledi I am with you on this @Aubrey he was still unconscious last time I followed that story. R15mil bail @Anne M definitely "So this is during his time. So what now?? Was he still ""not there"" @Bheki." @Jabu definitely but he tried to run so he was thanked with bail at least @Bandit maybe they followed up and found nothing cos media loves sensationalism like that. They would love such stories. it needs evidence otherwise it remains a conspiracy theory like aliens in USA 🤯🤯🤯 @Sonwa one day is one day🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ No Sonwa you you will make your own millions n billions fully legally 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ he banna Heather and Annie what is going on here? Are yal starting your own commission within a commission? Evidence leaders No Sonwa. Go back to replays No Sonwa then listen cos this is deep stuff going on here. Just u want drama and fighting. But 😱 Bheki didnt you listen to Eskoms guys when they were here testifying to the time of Zuma?? @Bhekie we will pray for you 🙏 No Jabu. Dont go there. Leave Bheki. He is in law @Bhekie knows law and he is an anc supporter. @Jabu agree. Hofmyer wont make it alone. we all see how much work she puts into her cases. Mr Seleka will be back to question Ms Myeni at a date to follow @Rene they are all great I agree. I see passion in all of them but different strategies and personalities. but they are all crushing it. Such respect for them "I miss Mr Notshe and Ms Mokonyane but in the same vein @Wilde. this is an inquiry. Information. Not a court of law. Only the NPA can do that. This comission will make recommendations but NPA will decide by merit who to prosecute. "Guys if you dont understand this commission "@R.m.B all the legal consequences will come from the info @Elton not you. There are some who dont. I didnt notify those who know cos we are many who know Jirrie and this jacket Sir? 😱🙈 @Tommy yes we had to. It was so interesting how Kate made connections uncontested "Yes Chair it is not acceptable to conceal. If your witness can expose whistle blowers @Rob. maybe it isnt his sisters jacket. Maybe he is the sister 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @ Tommy Im not bothered about the excellent work here. My concern are we going to get results from NPA or what will happen to the findings of this commission. thats the concern @Naledi call me when you have something healthy. Im off all these yummy things till end of this month 😭😭😭 🤯 🤣🤣🤣 @Raza where is he? lol @oom p @Oom 🤣🤣🤣 🙈🙈🙈🙈 @Tshe log back out then is the same. "this is ridiculous. Similar schemes at all SOEs. Everything is like same pudding 😱 😱😱😱 😭😭😭😭 Exactly what Ms Myeni organized in Eskom It aint peanuts for zero work or someone on suspension @Heather no but Eskom had a similar issue of execs who were suspended and given 6mil each @Salty exactly!!! @Raza its shock. Many of us felt that too 🤣🤣🤣 Witness must expose. Blow that whistle guy. We wont judge your jacket no more @Aubrey exactly @Yolo @Yolo block mos 🤣🤣🤣 @Madimetja try 🤣🤣 @Yolo really? I have so much attitude on here I am surprised youd say I am 1 of your favz He will have to come cos this dont make sense chair @Yolo only cos we havent disagreed yet 🤣🤣 Passionate debater Bye @Naledi @Yolonda log off please. some of us are listening closely DCJ @Naledi Danny K? 🤣🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ I actually sang to it reading that Jacket is innocent. But he ate that R10mil long ago thats why the jacket was patched together @Johannes true @Tommy🤣🤣 @Rene exactly but its the only way to entice an innocent person. Had he been guilty the amounts of wouldve been much lower Bye evergone🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ This yogi got training to get to

Heather Durr,@Blake Yogi I heard the statement by COPA this am-I aaume it was correct?? *Assume Cat find a reference though on Twitter.

Did Zuma do this Even the cats ran away as when really I lose my temper the room temperature drops to zero till I warm up 'or whatever' loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool DCJ must be loving that jacket Sit up properly SOUND SABC SOUND!!!! @Naledi Barron i was very happy to see the end of them .But remember the soapie Dallas those women and their big hair were surrounded by the shoulder pads-Boy we love them then @Naledi Barron Totally!

Your problem is that you take Blake Yogi seriously I don’t have that problem 🤷🏽‍♂️ @Blake Yogi He’s being asked about things he wasn’t involved in up to now Here’s a radical thought for feedback: We as South Africa annex Zimbabwe and put it under administration @LionView a new struggle to unify the nation Watson’s death is really really suspicious but the media never followed up and everyone moved on. So disappointing @Blake Yogi I’m disappointed dental records were not verified and the media didn’t follow up. I’m not suggesting any conspiracy merely lamenting the lack of media follow up and the strange... ...circumstances of Watsons death being largely absent from public consciousness @LionView rotten indeed! @Naledi Barron indeed.

Aubrey De Bliquy,Hello South Africa. What did I miss today? Where can one dispute a traffic fine? @Heather Jooste Indeed @Heather Durr I have no money. I cannot pay. with who @Heather Durr Who does one talk to? They confiscated my R129 phone and with it removed my last remaining source of income and expect me to pay R1200 to get it back which is a joke. A perverted law IMHO I think I will just ignore them and rather use the money to feed my children. "The horrible truth is as corrupt as the Apartheid was His eyes are open. Zondo loves South Africa. He has spent a life in service of South Africa. Agrizzi got bail to the value of his Italian Villa. Did he post bail or is he still in custody? @Blake Yogi @JS Bach I presumed so but Im not certain. I don't follow min stream news because they mostly lie or have no clue what is happening. I follow SABC to get an idea of the prevailing public narrative. @Rene ending corruption is a first step so this commission is waht seperates ud from tryranny of demagogues and political parasites. "It seems the undermining of Armscor may have been wilful at some level. Didn't Denel do some of the deep space telescope for the large array in Chile? It's not just guns and bombs and tanks. "DCJ must focus on the mandate of the commission. Our mandate is bigger It is easy to destroy a system in which you feel you have no part. This is our collective failure as South Africans. It's the hubris of power. We see extreme examples in USA where democracy is rocket science and the CIA has six ways to sunday to steal elections. @Rene Ngwenya I susect that went over the heads of all but a select few conscious souls. @Rene Ngwenya Yes "@Rene Ngwenya In times of mass delusion @Wilde Patrys Not necessaily. Justice is a painful process. @Rene Ngwenya It seems you are on point too. Whenwe share our thoughts openly we discover we are far closer than we thought possible. If those who can see do not speak out then all we will hear is the mischief of the blind and those who see but are in bad faith. ill will. It is reckless to give people jobs they are incapable of doing. @elton van neel "Bee must empower blacks to participate in the economy "Grants may be viewed as socialist "If CCMA ould have ruled his suspension as an automatic unfair dismissall Just as I predicted. See above. He did the right thing. I would have grabbed it. It was his career and their hamhandedness not his. 24 months salary is an admission they were doing something illegal. Not his fault. That is peanuts for an executives salary. exactly chair correct. They are admitting they victimised him The settlement is not irrational. He has the least to explain. The boards bulley tactics failed so they had to pay him an agreed settlement onsistent with his rights and damages. @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA An automatically unfari dismissal can be 24 months plus legitimate damages. "nuance is everything unles you love a witch hunt. I dont no matter the victim "@Naledi Barron Wow @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA You are right. 12 months max would be normal. 24 months is an admission of something far more troublesome. @Tommy Kernaghan You have to know your rights in the employment market. We should celebrate our rule of law governing fair labour practive. @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA 100% I read between the lines long ago what happened to this witness. No fault will be found. He was a victim that is why they paid him out without question. They feared legal exposure. "@Mzalwane Mzala Yes He was entitled to have his name cleared. @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA I have seen no reason to think he is not a competent CA of the highest integrity. the witness unless I missed something you saw @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA bye.
