Lucky123 Thwala,what time are they coming back? thanks six hundred thousands viva smith viva
hilton modike,30 minute guy mara anc is rotten .i mean who on earth would have believed that a guy vincent smith can b corrupted like that going to an extent where he got paid monthly as if it was a salary i guess there is a former head of operations who used to work for busasa willing to tell all .about the people who were paid why is the hawks not arresting this people iyho üò∑üò∑ @keith sindile dinabantu i have a feeling that zuma was right when he said he will expose most of the politicians who stole so much .its will take 10 years 4 the Anc 2 clean itself @mfumo Maluleke nwana mhani there was a corrupt tender given to bosasa at the airport and they were paying vincent smith R670000.00 & they did his security upgrade @his home 4 free .at a cost of k200 the guptas were real mafias the story that they employed fikile mbalula to b a sports miniter came up again on weekend .i guess made it a point that they put dirts on all the ministers cyril ramaphosa have got a women to work with i c a courageous women like thuli madonsela in her .this women was bullied so much & never succumbed @amanda watson i guess there was a way that she could be accessible with all this pressure on her .because i guess she feared that she have to explain things in a way they wanted her to the manner in which she was treated by faith muthambi as a women is embarassing . i cant believe that some women help men to perpetuate patriarchy against womens "to.all the womens in this country  @j ganasan .i guess it was fair to let her remain on her position if she was not comperent.the fact that she was acting for this long it tells that she is competent. @j ganasan i thought u could c between the lines that she was treated unfairly. @j ganasan .i think u would have felt much bitter if it wad u .because what was happening to her was unfair .and she was bullied by ur brothers atul's puppets philane u can say that again .i would have felt the same j ganasan u r a typical gupta puppets .why dont u ask the guptas to return home if ur mom was obesse were u going to say it .who u are to charge how she looks .that tells how stupid u saw her that tells that u are stupid .since she refused to b a puppet for ur master
TG Swartlane,They‚Äôre supposed to be back now@11 Mzansi time "There‚Äôs zuma faction in this comment section You are right @Thando "@David Masupa the problem with corruption is that "@David I was so furious  Absolutely @Dalu
KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Lucky123 Thwala Thing is "@Lucky123 Thwala I am sorry @hilton modike Hawks are still trying to entangle themselves from state capture. They were deep in the state capture ditch as well. @hilton modike Spot on! Zuma was correct! That shows there is a lot of corrupt to be revealed ahead of us. This calls for a lifestyle audit for all these corrupt fat cats
mfumo walter maluleke,what is this issue about vincent smith. Please fill me in
Marvel Mushavhela,"Are there any high profile cases that Hawks persued Can we all block this Ganasan dude - He's got energy in discriminating other folks just because of their skin colour and how they look. It just can be..mxm I've blocked them already
fernando visagie,"Just one question  "This dude is out of order "Uncle cyril must also come in and give account
Francois Cape Town,"They should also ask Cyril Ramaphosa what he knew about state capture
Floyd Nkuna,The position was vacant for 6 years cause the Guptas were still looking for a stooge.
Amanda Watson,"What happened was the always accessible
Black Panther Amen Kuma,OH OH üëÄ UMM SOMETHING BIG SHE IS COOKING
Fritz Faro,Thando lots of posts vacant but unemployment is high?? Eish! Talking of efficiency?
Phineas Motaung,with all this evidence why dont we have these officials being on the dock. We were made to believe that the inquiry wont stop prosecutions but nothing is forthcoming. I don't say they must be sent to jail but this evidence should be running parallel with evidence before a judge. Remember this evidence is evidence before court yet. No Thando you dont seem to understand. Gupta leaks were enough prima facie evidence and readonable prospects of prosecution. successful prosecution did anyone implicated deny authenticity of allegations the only denial was that Saxonwold could have been a shebeen No Thando Hawks is the investigating unit not the commission
Sharing Fam Space,ayikho iphunga yehlathi isizulu sisho njalo kuthen abantu abamnama besenza nje
Gambu,A 6 year vacancy on a country with so much unemployment.üòí
Madluphuthu,"I said it on Friday and I'm going to say it again "She loves her power and positions shame. it seems to me that had they given her the nice promotions Funny how many people here are now assuming that she was a victim just because she says so. people will be surprised when the hear another version of how this Willams lady tormented here staff. why should we just take her word for it? these allegations still need to be tested. @Philani ngcobo it just shows you how easily people are persuaded. Just shed a few tears and you'll have them eating out of the palm of your hand. It turns out that some people here have already pre determined the outcome here. Maybe the commission should just conclude its business cause its seems that we now know what happened. funny how people are so aggressive towards people who do not agree with them. ey you guys are funny yaz. childish "I'm guessing most people here are not familiar with the principle of ""Audi Alteram partem rule"". they just listen to a witness and make a conclusion. Unfortunately "..and I'm not praising anybody here "And take into account that Williams is being lead. None of her allegations are being challenged. Surely if she was talking about u "Its so annoying when people pre-judge the process. You might think you are being smart by so doing @thembisa nxopo WELL believe it or not but she is an admitted attorney.
Nicky majiya,I like Me Williams so detailed Is she still there at GCIS ? they were bullied Is angry crying "very sad "when you principled """this woman""" "This is what I observe Booi they tried their best all of them it wasn't easy
J Ganasan,"the lawyer is so cute. if she was questioning me so you were sidelined from your position os DDG - maybe were incompetent if she was incompetent - then the minister and DG did the right thing typical useless public servant - now claiming stress. tortured - no one touched your body. seems like u had nice meals. too much food in fact hilton - stop making false accusations. Gupta and Zuma shd be behind bars. But this obese lady should get real those supporting Williams must all be fat lazy public servants too im blocking u Marvel and Makhosi. Ure rude Thando - ure loss. No skin off my back baby Ms Williams is no fun to look at
Jp Mubita,@J Ganasan I'm sure you would.....lol
Philani ngcobo,It seems like she is angry üòÄüòÄüòÄ Lawyers for the defense will use her anger to ridicule her testimony. Yessss this commission is starting to heat up now. Herman he is highly professional is his job. "I don't buy that Madluphuthu
BOIKANYO MOLOI,eix so sad
Tebza Qmelii Lashad,üòÇüòÇ
Nomaswazi Hlope,"Yeah
Maimane H. L. Lekwane,"I respect Chairperson of the Commission Some comments from the likes of J Ganasan are just pure immoral "Yes
Siphiwe Booi,The State capture did not only damage the Government's monies but it actually emotionally abused our Mothers. It breaks my heart seeing Ms Williams holding back her tears.
joe nkabinde,this chocking stories we here believe me this is unaccepted at all
Miranda Valashiya,she is setting the record straight.
William Pieters,Will Faith Muthambi come before the commission? thx cool @Amukelani Mdluli I seems straight. it rofl Faith Muthambi??? Stay safe Mama Williams.
Amukelani Nelly Mdluli,Yes she has to what did we expect... the ministers who were in replace we obvious in work with the guptas corruption has to be uprooted @madluphutu elaborate for us Malema is not a saint here... he was part of the corruption
Vish Govender,M- It seems u know something?

David Masupa,these j z supporters don't cease to amaze me . they will support you even if you kill . they will try to find something to defend the indefeasible what a courageous human being. you are right miss /mrs William. muthambi is the enemy of the people of South Africa as a whole not only South Africa the continent as a whole. very proud of you mama absolutely we can't be so dumb to praise those who steal our hard earned taxes thanks to those sons and daughters of our beautiful country for their bravery and courage nobody has denied that the guptas received a refund from says . that is just one of many. ssrs so it must just go on she is ready to be cross examined. are they ready? "the guptas said they only want white waitresses because blacks are not clean enough for their liking
makhosi nobhatyi,Mutambi was serving her boss J Ganasan this is how Gupta get in government to loot government resources Bring it on mama Williams "Chetty she is well educated and has experience we need from a person Zuma was president not Cyril

Siyabonga Gasa,Madluphutu... you are so disappointing with ur defence brigade role which is not goig to earn you anything...there's enough evidence to corroborate Pumla William's testimony... she has taken an oath..and her testimony will form part of a report and thise accused will have to take in on review Madluputu...this is so so sad bra...get off ur horse...

Kwena Setumo,sure David.
Hardus Schoeman,Whats sad is the apparent lack of respect that our government officials have for citizens/taxpayers intelligence. Thinking that we cant see through what they are doing. The truth will come out eventually its just sad that it must take so long for us to get back on track as a country üòû According to a recent report the CIA warned the South African government about the Guptas's illicit activities as early as 2009!
