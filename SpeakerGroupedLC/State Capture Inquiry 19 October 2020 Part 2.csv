"@ Halo Who instructed ..... just answer that. My blood is boiling when I know of so many who do not have money for a loaf of bread. Look at this!

HALO,Piet vast just stating facts "No wonder they had stolen so much money 🤭 The fact that anc let the crime-rate skyrocket after 1994 just proves how incompetent they are as leaders. Anc goes to poor communities to deceive the people just to get their votes. The fact that anc would rather steal billions just proves that they don't care about the african nation. Wake up. "@Piet Vast "@Piet Vast "@Piet Vast If people were more stern about political leaders then corruption would have never thrived. Learn to have a leader mindset. I wonder how much money Cyril Ramaphosa is stealing right now.. Cyril Ramaphosa using his political position to build more McDonalds🤭 People need to stop treating politician like celebrities. At the slightest hint of their corruption the people must stand firm and remove them from governing positions. Learn to have a leadership mind We need to be treating all this with seriousness. This is treachery. Learn to be more strict with politicians Never trust someone who doesn't obey God's laws or at least doesn't care to obey his laws and has no desire to do so. "Obviously not all politicians are evil "We need a white government "I would only trust the African youth to run this country when they get older The african youth see the consequences of corruption and they themselves are victim to it. I have met many african youth who show promise for our future. The younger generation are not racists. 🤭 This guy knows how to do his job 🤭 Imagine that so many are struggling because of covid 19 and these people steal billions for a luxurious lifestyle. The sassa grant could've been more than R350. R350 is not enough. Anc leads the country into economic crisis and then steal billions🤔 maybe they are preparing for the collapse These are all the consequences of sin. His kids are enjoying the money Did yourll not see the pictures of one these those looter's sons posing with high stacks of cash and two luxury cars? Young kids brainwashed by usa rap culture...

I hope DCJ will mak make him pay the money with interest back to Transnet. I proposed that hard labor should be introduced to prisons. So that they must go and work without compensation.
Nicolas Cocolas,There he is looking up for the holy spirit again... 🙂 ANC voters must feel super proud with their choices...

All directors of Transnet at that time should come here "@Bizzana Ngesi Why is Mr. Mkwanazi tilting his head up and down? Is he being watched on a screen in front of him or what? The way his eyes is rolling is disturbing and disgusting But has Mkwanazi really did all filthy things out of his own accord seriously? I feel pity for him that he opt to go down without who pressured him
Lennon Marks,if he was following instructions it could only have come from the ANC. let us not be ignorant. let us accept the truth. the ANC is corrupt how can juju work for the poor if he is not poor maybe the commission should hook these guys on a lie detector while they are giving evidence a dedicated TV channel? maybe one of those that belonged to the Guptas

Ayanda Diliza,The trail leads to Gigaba Juju tried to leave politics & the ANC kept on trying to burry him when he had no political home. He had to change tactics and fight the ANC. Thanks ANC for creating Malema to expose your rot. Confused by things he signed-off himself. Some vote for ANC due to lack of suitable opposition. DA would probably bring back apartheid principles. EFF would probably undo any reconciliation efforts. Mkhwanazi is not only going down with the ship. He has tied the anchor chain around his neck.

Pheladi Lamola,Who is he talking to? DCJ is now talking in that reprimanding tone. DCJ must normalize stopping proceedings halfway and making these people take the oath again. I think they forget and end up lying under oath Judge Makhubele must be kicking herself watching this. I think she had a little chance with Mr Soni. Mr Myburgh takes no prisoners. Mr Mkhwanazi the lawyer is starting to have Ms Mbanjwa tendencies
Mfundo Ndwandwe,"someone just asked Hawks must be waiting for him outside. 😂 They are both marinating him nicely. 😂😂😂 I fail to understand the basis on which SAns are still voting for the ANC. "These people don't do any preparations "Lock him up @Hector D akubuzwa ✊🏿 What did I miss? Adv. is looking for someone. 🤔 "The advocate is pulling a ""FINISH HIM"" NJ now. 🙆🏿‍♂️😂" @Siyabonga Ndlela they should be waiting outside by now. @Gordon Dallas absolutely People still undermine Julius and that's why they always come up short with him. Have any of you seen what he does these Judges? Even DCJ Zondo struggled in his interview when Julius grilled him. "@Thandu Celuva you are correct Zondo is wrapping him up now. Mkhwanazi is pulling a Sodi Has Mr Gama appeared on this commission? Does he understand what are consequences of him agreeing with Zondo on everything? 🙆🏿‍♂️ I wouldn't be surprised if this man is currently serving on other boards. 🤷🏿‍♂️ "He's still digging his own grave

Sharon Cloete,And to think these crooks are left in charge of taxpayer money. Send the AFU to collect what they can from this lying witness. He should be charged with frikken perjury! DCJ is getting gatvol with these thieves This Mkwanhazi fellow thinks he can win an argument with these two. He is going to find out the hard way. What a liar! There aint no divine intervention here! Yes it can Monique; the ToR for the Commission were recently changed to include that Mr M when 2 plus 2 make 3??? He gives a liar a bad name "When you want to lie DCJ you are such a gentleman. I would have told him straight to stop lying He is really hitting his name and his family heritage with a plank. For a so-called chairman of a board of an SoE he is mighty stupid FFS how do we have such ignoramus' on the boards? This is cadre deployment at best I think if DCJ had a brick he would have thrown it at him!!
