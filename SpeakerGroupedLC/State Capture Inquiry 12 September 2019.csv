michael mbatha,"Almost on time What is 300 and million? "This sounds too easy to be true. How is it that multi-choice never knew Brown bag 😂😂😂😂😂 "Hlaudi's strategy of obfuscation is working.

Kevin Simon,HGM only looks on the bright side of life...... R600m budget R1000m expenses! where's the problem? Knowing when to consult someone with specific qualifications and experience takes someone to recognize that they don't know everything. Taking a decision without the facts is simply poor management. phillip chihuje ​the only way to resolve this issue in Africa is to remove boarders for Africans and use one currency the whole Africa as a continent Boarders???? Leeroy Lepere ​Christianity was a tool to keep us enslaved till today my brothers believe its really SAD.. Same can be said for all religions. Capture young minds and let it simmer. I think the witness is just enthusiastic and knows his subject matter. IIRC there was a suspicion of malfeasance between Multichoice and certain govt officials. Sounds like wasteful expenditure!!!!!!! "BRIAN TSHOKI ​This is South Africa What a contrast with HGM!! Control would allow competition for Multichoice. Faith wasn't subject to ANC. Subject to ZUMA. "It takes time to extract the graft. Never rush if it means an annuity income

Pastor J.J,@makhosi nobhatyi You are absolutely right.110% I like Hlaudi and some of his ideas but he destroyed the SABC even more than it was self destructing @Hosea M I can give you many facts but you have made up your mind not to accept anything that goes against your views. @Hosea M If I sold my car for R50 000 I will have an equalt amount if I got paid by the buyer. He sold the SABC library to ensure that salaries are paid. Makes sense? @makhosi nobhatyi Spot on. On point. The 1st visit was to the Gupta house. Supposedly for a free curry only.

My late mother was a cleaner. belive it or not @Hosea M I dont hate Hlaudi. I actually like him. I love you toooo. Others are expressing their views.

Pheladi Lamola,Hard to imagine DCJ playing squash Nyamisi. @Nomsa Mdhluli I can believe that. Hlaudi sounds smarter than the matric symbols he told us about. It's a shame that back in the day nobody probably cared enough to realise that he could be dyslexic. Let's not forget from the parliamentary inquiry into SABC that Hlaudi used to tell people he's going to Pretoria if they didn't do what he wanted. And obviously it'd be their signature on documents. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Zondo is not captured by Hlaudi people. He must be fair to everyone and give them an opportunity to state their case. Not to come here with his mind already made up. "Agreed @hendrix. I'm not sure how we got back to this again Hlaudi is very humble here at the commission Hlaudi could've done better in May elections had he appeared at this commission earlier Hlaudi is not gonna have as much fun when he comes back here methinks.

Born free,"This Hlaudi is the real ""deviation Artist""" Deviate Here Deviate There. I thought we were on the Financials.. another deviation Yes a serial pathological liar and Narcissist. Deviation at its best His evidence??? He caught a big fish.. the Auitor General Hlaudi is undoubtedly the most incredible witness His way or the highway I am sure charges will follow yes Judge Zondo Why does Zondo want to listen to this irrelevant testimony ? oh my word Who is farting? could it be Zondo Zondo take control They are having nightmares and not dreams.. about Hlaudi Nightmares not dreams passed away Ms Swanepiel had a dream of Hlaudi and died in her sleep. Haha yes Why are we going back to Benning? Hlaudi fired three journalists for showing benning buildings LAWYER Now he wants to be everyone's parent.. parents should not allow their children to watch any violence. Lllllaawyeeer What about Tsunamis where Journalists capture footage of the destruction and dead bodies?? Parents are responsible for what their children watch on TV. He wants Prayers of Relief from Zondo in 🤣🤣 Yeah. .What is Breast club? The Police of the Sabc His testimony was meant to be wrapped up yesterday morning She's alive yay Hope she has no nightmares about Hlaudi Water? Hlauid's lawyers will be dreaming about him for along time 😂 Appointed by the Guptas There is the Bible and Hlaudi's version If Hlaudi was in the right he would not have been fired. It takes board members to fire Hlaudi. He loves himself more """Ja "" is a South African expression for ""Yes""" Very strange people who work or worked at SABC. 😄 White colonialist will be paid for all Infrastructure designed and paid for with white man's money. I hope the DA and others can sent their messages out and not just the corrupt ANC government. Much more common sense than the Mr Policy. No encryption so they can spy on you. Did they ever supply these Setup Boxes? Who on this chat has a Setup Box? Wow what did that cost? True @Alfresco Was it this Minister Faith and Hlaudi that ate curry with the Guptas? Minister + Hlaudi = vegetable curry with the Guptas = Captured

Hlaudi is.. lol @André du Plessis the gentleman just said there's no such a thing called settop box. Apparently SA government came up with the word. lol Why is he shouting? """I have eTV at home. I pay nothing"" this dude... lol" "@Khaya Nomoyi I think he was saying that Multichoice said: ""This is Rubbish...""" SABC lost potential revenue due to egos... "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU a public company is one at which you can buy shares as any citizen like an MTN @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Their mandate is to serve the public. But they're not operating as a Public company I'm educating you not to feed incorrect info to your niece! You do not have a say on ops. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU they make decisions privately. That's what the guy means. You're cleverer than that. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU SABC is a State Owned Enterprise (SOE). Do you know what that means? @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Dude I already told you what SABC is. SOE. That does not make it a Public Company. You CANNOT buy SABC shares. They have 1 Shareholder. Government (STATE). @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU go read a bit on it. You'll thank me later... It is SOE. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU it is not a stupid argument. Go read again. Only Public companies trade on JSE. SABC doesn't because they're SOE. Parastatal Chief... @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU you are yet to learn chief... bye. @Jabu Malinga Indeed this witness is worth it... We're learning. @Pastor J It is a State Owned Public Broadcaster but that does not make it a Public Company. Public cannot trade SABC Shares. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU is a domkop. @Hloniphani Ndlela hahahaha...!! @Damon Radebe so this domkop blocked me. I only see you respond to him.
