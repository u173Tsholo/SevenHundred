When he is lying his voice goes lower There is no way he could not have remmembered the number of deposit boxes. Singh must have a lot of confidence to lie so openly about safety deposit boxes Mr. Singh was acquiring all large boxes he could get his hands on. The payments to him was coming in fast from... We now at Extra large "Extra Who needs so many large and xetra large deposit boxes? nobody has that many personal documenys. not even a library. "@Solomon Samuel "Please do not let him get away with ""I do not recall""" There is no one on earth who do not recall what they put in deposit boxes. The Evidence Leader came today with receipts.
