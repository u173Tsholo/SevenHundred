Nhlakanipho Matsenjwa,Bathathe MaRayRay! He should have done this from day 1 "in the words of Babes Wodumo @Kgotso Mpete HE IS RIGHT Basically he is saying he committed corruption because he was scared of losing his job as a result of going against his boss(es) he demands leniency simply because he came voluntarily to the commission..NOt smart move.. the advocates will end him after tea break @sammy sammido easy dude @Barnie Huysamer He stutter They want a name o his boss now.. As it turns out you cant be charged if you leave a position @Ozzy Ozzy He resigned/transferred when the invesigation started @Elton Josea I dont think he is protecting.. he is afraid.. Ealier he said 'when you go against orders you should be ready to face the consequences' Now the commission needs a name.. this old guy will give them a name of the person or a name of someone who will reveal the name @Antoinette Meyer I'd say its not even political.. its just a war between families.. Guptas vs Rupert and friends... Told you the name was coming.. "@Mbuso Ndlovu Unfortunately @Thabo Mzamani Ace and Zwane FFS
Andrew Mboweni,i like the integrity of deputy chief justice zondo for his leadership and hardwork "comparing the two presidents cyril ramaphosa is a heartless leader who is emotionless and does not care about south africans  @Mthobisi Dlamini that is not important i am andrew mboweni i agree on the nine wasted years but the six month of lockdown was very useless we lost our income from those who are very professional and well educated including tito mboweni not strengthening "@Zakes Pekwa  "cyril ramaphosa is a slow actor on the field of government south africa is a poor country which does not deserve the type of lockdown we had 2 "cyril ramaphosa was accorded many accolades on his ascension to leadership and presidency but now workers get payment late  Deputy chief justice welldone with your professional specifically on jacob zuma that he is not above the law and he must abide by the law of south africa "i am taking this opportunity to reflect on the leadership of ANC  "@Thami Ngwenya  "south africa is not the west and you cant compare the governance structures of the west with africans administration  "@Multi_African  "we must do away with ANC style of leadership  "@Ozzy Ozzy  and the voters should punish them @Ozzy Ozzy "@Kerwin Johnson  SECURITY REASON "In 1994 the national party was voted out of government because of apartheid and ANC was in  "ace magashule during thabo mbeki s term as a president was never appointed for any official post because the former president was so loyal to the people of south africa  "how did ace magashule manage to be on the top six since no one in south africa likes him  maybe ace magashule and david mabuza bought all mpumalanga and free state provincial members to support them in the nasrec ANC national elective conference @Tebogo Sibilanga fully agree master well said "Nelson Mandela all members of ANC government who are implicated in fraud and abuse of funds must be recalled and banned from running for office or serving in government WHEN THE CENTRE CANNOT HOLD ANC THINGS ARE FALLING APART PEOPLE OF SOUTH AFRICA "The new acting uif commissioner marsha bronkhorst uif ters payment for april and june monday and tuesday 
Tommygun,*crickets* so sad....3000 pages and no real questions Its like some unwritten rule that you cant discipline a brother or hold him to account... Did any money EVER come back? @Mbuso Ndlovu Im surprised at peoples appetite and the speed in which they can empty the fridge... "DCJ sounds genuinely surprised at these revelations Kinda impossible to not associate the ANC and the whole movement with the corruption and all the people representing them now. @Andrew Mboweni that wld be nice... Truth will out....sometimes. Its just about right and wrong in the system that we find ourselves in and using its rules.
