JDTheKidd,poor
dennis oldude,so we take 30 minutes to get absolutely nowhere And that is probably the last honest thing that she will say - her full name that is - the rest is suspect. will GArizzi be allowed to crso examine? Can't they sort out the housekeeping and mechanics in advance - waiting for this to happen is a complete waste of time any excuse to waste time and taxpayer money and the 5 minutes is calendar time no one at the commission has a normal watch how long is 5 minutes? I am a hero - not a thief - despite all the proof that says i am a criminal "can we get to the point please""?" who cares about the background and which soccer team she supports and what has it got to do with Bosassa money. The commission is not about soccer its about stealing money do we have to listen top this diatribe? You won't survive the state capture punishment - if it ever gets finalised - Please Judge - stop her please get Kate or Paul to take over here/

Oyol Bonny felix,.
bashin seanego,this madala wont get anythig waste of time
Philani Ndhlovu,Can we just start already
Mr Kudzani SBM Ndebele,This Advocate is a disaster. ls it deliberate that the Zondo Commission wastes so much time on silly admin work while on air at the cost of taxpayers? This is scandalous. This Commission is wasteful.
Landelisa Mzantsi,This Adv though!
Mandla Mngomezulu,"@Thabiso Gumede
Thomas Paget,What’s that behind you What’s that behind you
el bono,back to school is cool!!! Decolonized education! too hard to watch this incompetent lot
rc Menon,:buffering:
Senzo Mathonsi,Counsel is struggling to get to find the point. Busy fumbling around hoping the Chair takes him to the point. The commissioner might as well lead Nomvula.
lekau phalama,This lawyer does not seem to know his story. He struggles with filing and schooled in public by chair and further directed on how to take the job forward "The way this adv is going
Leonard Masilela,Adv Notshe is very competent people. Otherwise he wouldn't be leading evidence at the Zondo Commission

Msawenkosi Ndonyela,money looghting by the Capital
Nkululeko Njapha,People have already answered them selves. You guys want Nomvula to agree with what Agrizzi. If Agrizzi was correct what the point having her there. Exaclty @Mike Mike how do you what car she drives @Tumelo Magasha where are Malema kids studying? where did Cyril kids study? @Lesego Letlhake In a commission she is a witness not a suspect. You cross examine in court. @TheMzolo Can MTN support any political party?
Cain Chunda,the problem is that u lot want to hear what your minds are made up on. hence u will b attacking Socalled incompetence of Adv who don't help u with that but he's her lawyer isn't it? perhaps I missed something @Alvino u want her to admit everything? 😂 😂 😂
dada ngova,Cyril has no priorities.. wasting money on this national Party did not care about poor people as well..all politicians are mafias..politics is a dirty game what's a black privilege?
Dontexpectme2getgud,Guys press alt+F4 or command + c for apple users to unlock an amazing Easter egg on youtube!!!

Paul Buchel,The house has never moved away from there? "This advocate looks like he's defending her
Jean-Pierre Le Roux,@Riaan DW the ANC blames the white man for black poverty to get voters. 26 years is enough time to make your own Black privilege is not helping their poor brothers almost a billion spent here and no one arrested. Let me steal a bread and I'll go to jail "Just do a lifestyle audit on her. Can she afford the cars  @Jay Cole don't forget the corrupt Mandelas....... "@Jay Cole for me  "@Jay Cole  "@PHIL RAMBAU

Kgomotso Moabi,I find it very strange that she is denying all this accusations. but then couldn't they asked Agreesy to crossexamine her
Neo S,"She will deny everything She needs a shrewd Adv who will successful dig the truth let's hope the chair will come with useful question to assist the Adv to arrive at the truth
Malapateng Mphahlele,"she is moving
Mulaudzi Khathutshelo,Paid Grocery and funeral arrangements arguments are useless as they cannot be proven. Talk talk her child must be invited as well
CHARLES MARULA,Riaan DW nonsense
lufuno shumani muloiwa,That's It😂😂 Adv is having low self esteem 🤔 Paul Ely are You? 😂😂 i want to be the COE of Bosasa and hire my family & friends as they are all adults Apartheid created nepotism & the ANC endorsed it .that's simple

Lubabalo Ntsaluba,uyadwaba lo cc yhuu
Tumelo Magasha,Ironic how Ministers won't even let their children study at our public schools. @Nkululeko Njapha definitely not at Maphutha Secondary School or Moletsane Secondary School 🤷
Khaya Nomoyi,Problem the adv cant cross- examine the witness as it is not allowed in commissions except to put Agrizzi's version to the winess.Thats why the adv looks as if he is fumbling.
Annes Ieua,how do you make your shaved head shine like the head of the adv #TheShining?😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂glycerine??? show it Riaan!😂😂 Majiya give the lawyer a chance! he's a long ranger lol!😂 "guys there is nothing wrong with the lawyer "guys that water bottle is not her's i never trusted a corrupt rotten Agrizzi at all! How can you trust someone who admited publicly that he was the corrupt dog number one?
Naledi Barron,@TheC4RB1N3 Spot on regarding China. A very dangerous country.
Nkululeko Mdluli,"they r intimidated by her already even the chair seems already intimidated true @Anwar Syed he's just too weak. I think sparks will fly when she's cross examined by Agrizzi's lawyer if that will happen.
soza makhubele,i have never seen such an incompetent lawyer this one.....he only deserves to work in magistrates courts
Phillip Phoku,Nomvula Mokonyane says her children cannot get jobs because of the proximity with her. Can you believe it?
Eugene,Cyril would of been wort $40 billion if he were actually a business man and used the money that he stole through BEE to make jobs. "Cyril is not a business man. he never was. The money he has you can count how many windows and light bulbs is in the room by looking at his head. Bye guys 👋 I'm going off to the smart city. will be quick if I take the bullet train. The battery of the tablet I got from Cyril is almost done. Who voted ANC for a tablet and didn't get one?
