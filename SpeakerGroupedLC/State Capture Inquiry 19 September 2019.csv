G T,Having breakfast!!! No sound again!!! "Its a plot Orchestrated by the implicated cops!😂 Just plug into the external audio. Do they still have employed sound engineers? I thought Hlaudi was fired? Now they are going to adjourn until the problem is fixed. No wonder they need another year!!! The sound is probably being attended to by an outside contractor which they haven't paid.😂 "Epnet Streaming
Person of interest,"judge gave keynote speech at the Bram Fischer event last night. his voice was very bad by the time he finished did anyone watch the siu sabc presentation to parly yesterday? "same problem as yesterday *SABC EXTERNAL AUDIO PLEASE* sabc channel led the 🎤 funds into hlaudis pocket how will they work out how to broadcast the rugby? I didn't realise Hlaudi still has friends at sabc. hope he paid them to stream the rugby
Thola Nhlebeya,What happened
Pastor J.J,Is it just me or the sound is messed up again? NEWS ALERT FROM SABC DIGITAL........Due to Budgetary constraints together with all the money stolen by Management we have employed the Tea Assistant as Sound Engineers. Please be Patient. The Tea Assistant a.k.a Sound Engineer is back and so is Ms September thankfully. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I remember a chat a few months ago. You said she looks like your ex-girlfriend. Ndluli's sentencing procedures start today on his conviction for kidnapping Mdluli @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I became more interested after you said she was an ex.hahahahahaha. Just kidding I am too old for all of that

"@I Am Free To stop that guy Ace in the hole Ohh Judge Zondo is ill.....that why he is so grumpy? He has been sitting on that chair for over one year......he needs comfort?
Sindiswa Moolman,Are you serious @Cerebis? I thought they approached NT for R500m bailout for that purpose. And they confirmed that they met all the requirements for a bailout from NT @Cerebis You can become a Commisar
Norman Zwane,My ancestors are telling me that the road to OR Tambo needs to be cleansed with a white male goat and the sound will improve and Watson shadow will pass. The slaughter must be public.

Granny Mokwena,i thought I was the only one noticing Zondo's coldness towards her they never keep up with time comfort is needed
Derek Main,Sounds works fine when they adjourn! I think Zondo is a bit harsh on Adv September but she also seems to be quite feisty too. Maybe they have some kind of history? "@Sthakathi Khumalo I agree - not pleasant to watch or dignified. Perhaps if she just bit the bullet and didn't react "@Mangalani Mangalani I think Adv Norman gets nervous and starts bumbling when Zondo criticises her. If he didn't do that @welton paulse The uncle who has a bit too much to drink at family gatherings? 🤣 "@Ime Udo-obong Couldn't agree more - xenophobia is not cool. Having said that "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU @Gee Peex1 One law for the ANC elite
