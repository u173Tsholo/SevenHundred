Nelson Musoliwa,A bug from the heart perhaps Will the day belong to the comm or Mr MAnyi Like to know how he transfer came about; who initiated it and why Sorry how his transfer came about Articulating govt position is different from personal opinion finish and klaar Is media not watchdogs only TNA must be govt mouth piece what about biases nature of its reporting Manyi is lost too deep now So Thato you are implying that TNA was a govt mouth piece Manyi is knowledgeable about media but is wasting time because we need to know how TNA got govt tender and what was his actual role If the gupas can appoint ministers and they are owners of TNA u can draw some conlusion @trucker No me and u are not in court but are on public opinion and evidence have been provided to that effect by govt officials anyway and under aoth. Do u ignore that as well Are we not hearing it for the first time that business people hire and fire ministers Thato i may be not updated perhaps are u @Trucker u do not have evidence to counter govt officials evidence either and the overwhelming indicators to gupta treason activities The right to exist on the part of TNA is not wrong but how it came into being and how it operated is what is in question here.
