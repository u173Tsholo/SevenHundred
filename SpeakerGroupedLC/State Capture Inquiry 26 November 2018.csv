Nelson Musoliwa,A bug from the heart perhaps Will the day belong to the comm or Mr MAnyi Like to know how he transfer came about; who initiated it and why Sorry how his transfer came about Articulating govt position is different from personal opinion finish and klaar Is media not watchdogs only TNA must be govt mouth piece what about biases nature of its reporting Manyi is lost too deep now So Thato you are implying that TNA was a govt mouth piece Manyi is knowledgeable about media but is wasting time because we need to know how TNA got govt tender and what was his actual role If the gupas can appoint ministers and they are owners of TNA u can draw some conlusion @trucker No me and u are not in court but are on public opinion and evidence have been provided to that effect by govt officials anyway and under aoth. Do u ignore that as well Are we not hearing it for the first time that business people hire and fire ministers Thato i may be not updated perhaps are u @Trucker u do not have evidence to counter govt officials evidence either and the overwhelming indicators to gupta treason activities The right to exist on the part of TNA is not wrong but how it came into being and how it operated is what is in question here.

Trucker Trucker,@Star Shine OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS FARMED THE LAND. YOU CANNOT TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THAT!! @Star Shine Perhaps you can start by learning spelling and grammar. @Star Shine Are you Steenhuisen's so n? "Zondo was never this busy & involved during Pravin's sermons. Manyi is engaging @Nelson Musoliwa What's wrong with TNA getting govt tenders if no law was broken? @Nelson Musoliwa Doyou have any evidence of your claims? "@Joas Masilo Hiine The leaks that have not been verified and inadmissable in the court of law? Same leaks that were leaked by the media? LOL @Nelson Musoliwa Don't tell me about public opinion. Back up your claims with evidence proving that the Guptas appointed a minister. @Joas Masilo Hiine You're wasting our time. Either you produce solid and incriminating eveidence or just watch and be quiet. @Nelson Musoliwa LOL bro you're accusing the Guptas of all these things but no one has produced any solid evidence. Not even Pravin. Shouldn't the accuser be taking the lead? @Thando Nkutha Look how that turned out for Phumla Williams. "Why is it difficult to grasp a simple point that a party who got 4% of the stake can hardly be said to have ""captured"" government? It's a blend of logic and arithmetic."

Nkanyiso Mathamba,"Pravin was allowed to do as he pleased there yet they are grilling Cde. Manyi and doubting what he is saying there Manyi reveals that its a lie that the New Age took all the money from GCIS. Only 4.5% went to the New Age. White owned Naspers took R17.9 million
Thulani Bukani,I also think Pravin had an easy time at the inquiry. I didn’t even know what he was saying half the time.
Thato M,"@Nelson Musoliwa he is explaining a global media phenomenon practised all over "Don't approach Manyi's inputs through SA media lenses @Bruce Andrew how is the board and Exco of ABC constituted? @Bruce Andrew who makes up the steering and operational exco of ABC? @Bruce Andrew so you make input you can elaborate when questioned you refer to Google! Yikes "@Nelson Musoliwa listen to what Manyi is saying "@Nelson Musoliwa bear in mind that most of government media spend still goes to news sources that are too critical of them "@Bruce Andrew Sowetan biggest circulation "@Marvel Ramatshela name calling was used during apartheid times "@Bruce Andrew 😀😀 believe what you want to. Sowetan ISN'T the highest. None of the mainstream newspapers aren't. Go do your research "What will never be said is how much of the GCIS spend goes to Sunday Times "People will tell you TNA was captured but total budget of GCIS they garnered is nowhere close to mainstream media 😀😀 TNA was captured at 4.5% and the rest was everybody else So the entire country is being take to task for R 8million by TNA in this instance. Yikes Which business people don't influence government appointments? Why is this practice only condemned when practiced by some but ok with other business people "@Joas Masilo Hiine you are clutching at straws on those so called Gupta leaks Manyi must explain stats are based on holding companies "@Joas Masilo Hiine the law doesn't work that way "@Trucker I have said to @Joas Masilo Hiine that he law doesn't work that way "@Joas Masilo Hiine not sure what this last message means "Manyi statistics are on point "Manyi on Tiso blackstar Chairperson doesn't understand proportionality of revenue spend. National Treasury uses a similiar basis for various departments. He unfortunately mistaken @peter pott explain White collar capture of the state.

Bruce Andrew,"Clearly Manyi has no idea of how the ABC works.
