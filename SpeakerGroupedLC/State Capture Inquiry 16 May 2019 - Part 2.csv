Felix Muyoba,not even elaborating what work was done..just work done..thieves!! imagine!! "so @welton paulse true they are part of the looting @Thando Nkutha @Lexi ðŸ˜‚ true boiling is even better @Lexi true @Thando Nkutha ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ work done!! that is true..who was the GCE then?\ "@Lexi even that is a lot of money @Lexi kikiki but those people should be asked about what they did with that money because thats a lot @Lexi it went to transnet account "hau I think these are the anonymous whistle blowers who revealed these malpractices to thuli @Michael Wild ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ true DCJ is struggling with the word unsolicited @Singi Mathebula true..these things started from there but we were not allowed to question them otherwise you go to 1oth floor! 10th floor @Michael Wild but normally you cant get rich on stolen money..you didnt work for it..period @Michael Wild true "so i think he was one of the people who was leaking the information and i commend him for that.. @Cerebis do you think the CIC will accept that? @Cerebis he will never go back because if he goes back thats betrayal of his party and what if they frustrate him at ANC and tell him that why did you agree to come?
Alexia,back pocket scary numbers but sad how the country gets robbed like that I'll take just 500K for WORK DONE ðŸ˜‚ Felix at least everyone in Chat will get a cutðŸ˜‚ What happened with the so called REFUND? This guy is not telling the whole truth His story sounds buttered ðŸ˜‚ Thando 25Bbln went to China scary nr's with so much stolen it is surprising S.A still has a National Treasury ðŸ˜‚ Malusi Gigaba what job he got now Minister of Corruption Microsoft Disappear Edition Could they lease without taking any computers but just paying for nothing? Brian is in dog box wise questioning skills he came prepared was this guy CFO of Transnet?
welton paulse,93 million ....bathong Monopoly money These people were litterally playing monopoly with real money jirrrrrrr yessssssis
Wildthing,AA and BEE lead to this. instead of a process of education and promoting staff that meet the requirements. it broke down working systems and let crooks take over. how to optimise the stealing of Tax money I am not a fan of PW but he could show where all his money came from and he was not rich. Felix I agree but you could see what he had and where he retired to see he was not living like a king and travelling world wide showing off. he was a nasty man and that will stay in history Bosasa command room 1000 x R8.000.00 a lease would mean you pay more because they cover repairs and on site visits and renew after 3 to 4 years. so it would work out to 450 Ã— R10.000.00 true where are the scorpions. we need them back. start by S/n and Gumtree or they never arrived and it's a fake payment money laundering just made that it could happen.
