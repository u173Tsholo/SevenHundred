Gwede Mantashe will come here to testify he is the owner of these properties so calmed down he appeared publicly rubbishing that evidence that he buy his own camera so after his testimony then we can Mantashe must come here to account as ANC member if does wrong must step up and take full responsibility that is all "Cameron kim I can assure you that will happen nothing is hidden now Cameron kim you are just a hatred of the president I cannot help accept that Ramaphosa has done nothing wrong even his son disclosed contract which he did job for Bosasa as small company he run Cameron kim you are out of order brother Ramaphosa didn’t even benefit and you heard how that happened so why you accusing him? "African refugee state security agencies was captured by Zuma "Briony French this Bosasa thing was mafia within the state taking advantage to blackmail people such as Mantashe I think Mantashe when he comes to clarify matters then we connect dots This woman must come down she too energetic and chairman will intervene more than her coz she can make mistakes Sounds please Chair please instruct technicians Freedom activist becomes soft when they come to office So that they can care about sound they don’t see Much better Counselor coughing 😳😳 Watson was putting Agrizzi in mud nhe

Magda Seguin,In one online photo Mantashe was present with Bosasa staff He even gave an interview saying he don't know who paid for it It is beyond my understanding how anyone can think that Judge Zondo would allow illegal inspections... @peter pott you really think an entire team of prosecutors and investigators will open themselves up to illegal activity? Please don't speculate I remember in Mr Mlambo's previous testimony he alluded to implicated people being notified ALL implicated people are kept abreast of all proceedings that affect them...The onus is on them to respond...TIMEOUSLY...not like Mama Action who waited more than a month to respind I get upset when people are trying to protect ANC thieves With technicalities...nogal @Robert Russell...some are brainwashed by BLF/EFF propaganda The sound is very bad @Peter pott...that is a question the Judge should put to the entire team of prosecutors and investigators not to a few not concerned with correspondence and/or admin "This is just ONE investigator @peter pott..state funds are stolen and you are protecting the ANC who put us in this mess...technicalities will never overshadow the overwhelming evidence of theft of state funds You and I don't know what is happening behind the scenes...no need to speculate that the Zondo Commission allows 'illegal activities There is a ton of other evidence implicating the thieves @peter pott you appear to be hoping they all go free for treason "ALL these implicated thieves are arrogant @peter pott...you can mos sommer become an advisor to the commission I font know why South Africans are not outraged by the ANC making the country a failed state "@Peter pott...you have all the answers it seems.I rest my case.Up till now the NPA @L L indeed...everybody seems to overlook how articulate and detailed his evidence is...I even sense hostility in the questions put to him ALL our SOE's are bankrupt because of the ANC but people still believe in flying fairies...it seems like the betrayal of a population is a narcissistic desire of the abused people There are so many ANC corruption denialits on this thread....enjoy yourselves So much noise...The sound is terrible Respect for your sacrifices Madame Stop the derogatory comments...is this how you talk about women and especially those that went to prison so you can be free today? So why do you comment on women's clothes @Ewald Kruger...it's like the men who say women's clothes make them abuse women sexually... "The men commenting on this lady @ttsomele...thank you...The silence of others who attack wi.en are complicit *women @Cerebis...you are an honourable man! There they go again....derogatory comments...SA's are really a sad bunch always slandering about appearances I think Apartheid succeeded in making South Africans hate each other @Cerebis...they just perfected the hate @Sofia Sofia There are 46 parties that registered...take your pick @Anne M...that is why I have multifocals @Sofia Sofia...most people don't get satire "@James Watson was busy going to court twice trying to hang onto Bosasa after declaring insolvency and the retracting it saying he received  @MIKE LOCK..I went twice to Dubai for work...Will never go there on holiday...it's a complete artificial city built on money from all around the world "The entire Dubai is built with manpower from poor countries...Malaysia Malema said he will kill for Zuma then forgave him...a few days ago he said vote for EFF who will put Zuma in prison...how in the heck can anybody with sense vote EFF?

If I could like your last statement @African Refugee I would like it 1000 times Only a fool signs something when behaving illegally. Which is why Gavin Watsons signature isnt on one document.... He tricked Agrezzi and them into signing. According to Gwede his upgrades where done by whomever the ANC got to do them... He didnt know he was getting Bosasa upgrades apparently. But I dont believe anyone I can barely hear when they speak... he mumbles like a drunk and so I dont trust him...

James,"Warrant or not is irrelevant. What is most relevant is that none of this parties were in a position to award any ""contract"" to Bosasa" @Thando Nkutha i agree with you. But you first need to demonstrate an illegal action. Gwede was SG of ANC. He was not in a position to provide any tender to Bosasa. So what's the illegal relationship? "@Thando Nkutha i agree. But they can always go get a warrant and do inspection again. What they have completely failed to demonstrate @Thando Nkutha these security systems were in the media last year september. Inspections by Det. Mlambo were done last month. If these ppl wanted to hide anything they had 5 months to do it already "@African Refugee the DA wanted to bring charges against people like Gwede and Nomvula "@Derek Main in what way did they provide ""massive influence""?" @Sofia Sofia there is no point to the last 2 days. Irrelevant evidence "@makhosi nobhatyi Agrizzi was chief of operations @Renee Lane they are not corroborating Agrizzi's evidence. These people have never denied having security systems installed @Sthakathi Khumalo All they are corroborating that there are existing security systems at these properties. However no one has denied this. Gwede even took journalists on a tour some time ago of it. "@Anne M. it is still irrelevant. Unless the ""payment"" was for something in return." @Frik Brits dont worry @Cameron Kim is talking crap. He is currently in Krugersdorp. It is well directed @MIKE LOCK Gavin Watson is in Krugersdorp. @Cameron Kim is most likely a Agrizzi using a fake name @Cameron Kim PE is not in Dubai. "@Cameron Kim when you left intelligence @Cameron Kim no he doesnt. He has a house purchased in 1994 in PE and a townhouse in Krugerdorp purchased subsequently. "@Cameron Kim he has a house in PE purchased in 1996 "@Cameron Kim I'm telling you "@Cameron Kim you havent answered the question though "@Cameron Kim no sadly i am not eating from any pie. Now @Cameron Kim i would love the truth. When will you actually share it though? "@Cameron Kim ok i will stop asking why you are lying "@Cameron Kim I'm happy to see the truth. But you arent telling it. Gavin Watson is not in Dubai @Cameron Kim he never left. What made you even think he was ever there? @Cameron Kim yes. I am protecting him from your lies. You are welcome to tell the truth though @Cameron Kim but he isnt in Dubai. Which makes you a liar.
