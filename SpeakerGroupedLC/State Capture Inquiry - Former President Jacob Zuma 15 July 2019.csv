SAs are not idiots Preaching Please stop the diatribe International journalists here I liked how Adv Trengrove exposed this lawyer in the PMB court with Zumas last court appearance Playing the victim game "Zuma made SA a failed state Coward He said the Guptas was his friends finish and klaar Bravo Mr Pretorious Commission procedure says if you have the intention to implicate people that they should be informed invadvance @Anne M what is the rule? Up to now nobody insulted the DCJ and the commission like this Must be Carl Niehaus and the YOUNG MK veterans clapping But you danced yesterday...liar Victimhood "No Kwezi is turning in her grave You sold out your country to foreingners So his reasoning is thats it a conspiracy against him You violated the constition @Yin Yang exactly Hahaha ! what did I say about pkaying the victim? he says there is a conspiracy Yirre history lesson Zuma style Tell us how you gave orders to have comrades to be killed in Angolan camps.Ramathlodi told us everything "Lots of us were in exile Karma is coming for you "Very confusing Indirectly targeting Mbeki He is still bitter that Mbeki recalled him a Deputy President He is referring to ANC stakwarts saying they conspired against him Mbeki recalled himcand he never got over it.If he has proof he must show it "No @David Tuer its disgusting that hecis given so much rope Who are THEY???

Brakpan Motaung,SC. Pretorius or Maleka against Zuma will do. Over to you Mr. Pretorius... Listen to Zondo's response to Skhakhane... Mr. Pretorius...@Zondo's voice Pretorius says there is no logic... @Sandiso Maleka vs Skhakane it was going to be lit. Skhakhane... Why is Skhakhane painting the commission with such stark colours? Bua Pretorius Bua... Wait for Zondos' line of questioning...He is so patient. And am certain SC. Pretorius is also busy. It is alright for the former president to story tell this episodes. But the truth will prevail. South Africa has deeply entrenched polarization of power-corrupt that is becoming eminent while the former president is talking. One can sense that we are corrupt-led country. ANC Literature. """I have been patient Law is the law and it does not rely on anecdotes. it relies on facts and documented facts alone not hearsay.

FFS moving on now @Lee Grant there hasn't been one Fing question yet.... this is his intro and it's a pity it took almost 10 LONG LONG years I don't think he even knows how many children he has as he can't count beyond 10 😃 😃 Clever company So how many private companies advertised in/on these media channels....... ????? OMF.... is this part two of this story he is trying to soften the hard questions coming.... by saying I told you that answer in my opening statement Tell us about your relationship with Putin and the nuclear deal ????? Next the KohiSan and Jan van Riebeek in the after luch session The Zondo commission planed 5 days of testimony.... day one..... nothing...... so they will never get to all the questions they have lined up for ZUMA

Matjeketje SoulProvider,"forever clearing his throat
Raymond Maboya,the background details Zuma is providing the commission right now is quite key and it's important to interpret it without any bias. We were told about these incidents from a very young age I'm surprised they're surfacing now. The ANC's communication has always occurred outside the country... I hope this will make people aware that the CODESA was only media address of what has already begun a long while before 1990... "People who didn't want to comprise the liberation of black people in the ANC were sidelined... many comrades died in the process. Chris Hani when is he going to the toilet... so much water in winter...
sibusiso chris ndlovu,who killed Chris Hani?
Charlie Komape,conspiracy theories? "history of the ANC is not the issue here "judge zondo call baba to order the history of the ANC and the plan to deal with him are not issues at stake Rumour about your resignation needs to be substantiated and those people are probably dead. This is leading to the case of Mpshe throwing out the case against Zuma based on false tapes? you make stories to appear as a victim no deal bcos zuma= to Gupta "Victim he was taken by the Guptas He gets employed as a partner by the Guptas not having worked bcos he could not be employed due to victimization as your son ? i just wish that adv.moerane should be the one to cross examine zuma.

Ontibile Malotwane,@tsatsi ra go ema tsatsi lotlhe too much water too much wee then too much adjournment
David Tuer,Judge Zondo hopes to finish with Zuma within the 5 days allowed. Fat chance. Zuma's lawyer complained of bias. which other witness has been given free time to claim innocence before being questioned? Now his paranoia is in full bloom. He will hang himself. They should let Kate Hofmeyr loose on him11 He seems to forget that it was he who set up this commission. He can hardly now complain about being asked to testify.
Hector Nkandu,uBaba ka Duduzane does not respect us.
Janine Kayser,sounds like he is beat boxing! he is adding a beat to the crap he's talking. he is showcasing his ability to release a music album for which department of arts and culture will be paying. his verbal rant is ultimately going to get him in hot water because he is talking his party down. is this oh shame I have been a victim of my own party going to continue for the rest of the week? throat clearing up now he is now very comfortable talking he will be dropping names soon. Zuma must have been an ostrich in a past life because he is wondering why the whole world thinks he is corrupt.?

He is confusing issues to do a cleansing process of himself.This issue is about when you were a President not before. This is relevant to the arms deal fraud case not here. The judge must control this now its too much and not relevant.

Edward suffered some contracts. And then did you help him with contracts. @lenox no. Durban is not in South Africa. Maybe he thinks Nkandla is a separate state. Yes. One of my mate in KZN. When a Zuma daughter moved there they got no more load shedding or water outages. Convenience or coincidence? Unemployment 3rd highest in the country. Oh and they don’t have 📺 or 📻 there. In fact they don’t even have internet so nobody knows Zuma there. ☕️ with no questions. Pls mr Zondo no more preamble now. When did the Guptas qualify as “comrades” where were they during apartheid?

MCFinest-sean,He fail to show love or respect for the country. It’s all about him. A leader put his people first not himself. What about those who doesn’t have dad to send them to Durban to get job? What a waste of air time. Everything it’s broken under ur watch transnet eskom telkom hospital home affairs I can go on and on. Because he doesn’t love or respect South Africa. All he think about it’s smaller nyana 10% Can we go to point we heard this so many times Anc was great for people until comtsotsi figures out to fat their wallets Not convinced Pls sell the poison story to ur comtsotsi Crying for our beautiful country we have to start voting for president straight not through party look what anc gave us. Primay level of thinking president. 😂😅😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 😂😅😂😂victim victim No don’t die live and see what u created This commission it’s abusing us. Why allowing him to do this. I understand he have to state his case. It’s too long next time he needs to be timed. That when u live guluva life.
