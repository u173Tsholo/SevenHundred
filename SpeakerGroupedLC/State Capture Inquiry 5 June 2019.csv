Jeremy D,hi
makhosi nobhatyi,Where is advocate Maleka? "Pretorious get frightened by the noise outside As Gordhan says those who are corrupt they are not just sitting there doing nothing they organize to fight back. He said that back 2016 we have seen this happening recently I am not surprised "Derek Main hey the old man is not reporting correctly "Reserve bank issue statement to the minister of finance which he rubbishy all of that "@Naledzani Mashau the party knows where to start but problem is "Ramaphosa patience will come to unend coz when they continue doing so they are delaying government to do its own job so that they can count on him as a failure I think Ace Magashule was not supposed to report about SARB matter because it not yet been finalized @Derek main I got you brother but faction of are in the hurry as you heard Masina and Tony Yengeni publicly criticize president for appointing Gordhan they feel threatened "@Derek main no I am not suggesting that he was a worst thing all I am trying to say he is lacking experience he should report outcomes "@Zikhona Zondani ANC chief whip she is a hard work "Enoch Godwangana is not happy at all by the matter of SARB saying wat was read by SG was not accepted resolution of naserec says SARB should be remain private @Cerebis Ace Magashule is reading post naserec NDZ campaign not resolution of the conference. Conference was very clear about reserve bank that remained private so we can create jobs "@Derek main 🙆🏻‍♀️😃😃😀 no you need to understand old man is fighting back using Anc position to sabotage Ramaphosa leadership doing purposely Ramaphosa stance in fighting corruption hasn’t changed @Cerebis 🙆🏻‍♀️😀😀😀 CR have huge problem here Ace Magashule is messing everything when Q&A happens lol faction live inside him lol "@ Derek main yes those people should listen to Mbalula back in 2015 when he says electing Ace the party will go down @kevin Allister Simon indeed it is number coming weeks Guptas whistle blowers will take stand and email will be show as reflection so he is trying to get supporters but he is weak no power "I hope before he can address media "ANC is for all people "@Kevindbn007 it is a process that will happen need time as we go along @Zikhona Zondani you notice what I have seen 😃😃😃 @Kevindbn007 that is what we need those who did wrong must be exposed and acount here and be arrested that was a resolution we took at Naserec If anc deploys me as a minister I should do my job honestly and transparency no shenanigans once I have found I did wrong party mustn’t defend me fire me to save image of the organization
SONGEZO MNCOKO,when is number one Tsotsi gonna come
Masbu Mqu,his dayz r numbered
William Pieters,Nedbank is going down aswell. Very well said @Ernest Eniboy
SBH Shembe,I wonder when the human race will wake finally wake up.. I mean really wake up @Naledzani Mashau don't trust any politician.. yup .. just make sure you are in a space where you can deal with disappointments leaving this soap opera .. Days of our lives
Kevin Simon,"""To oppose corruption in government is the highest obligation of patriotism"" quote by G. Edward Griffin" "“Come forward as servants of Islam Didn't Zwane also make a statement re engaging the banks on the Gupta accounts and claim it was a Cabinet Resolution? "Perhaps Ace knows his number is up and trying to sow misinformation as much as he can
Slindile Ngcobo,@Ernest Eniboy ....eishhhh
Ted Michel,Where is all the background singing coming from ?
Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Yes - you only had to listen to Ace yesterday to see who is leading that charge. @makhosi nobhatyi He was clearly drunk and was doing his usual waffling. He didn't answer questions asked and eventually walked off without answering all questions. Total arrogance. @makhosi nobhatyi He actually asked for the scraping of the tender system. I'm not sure why he would want that - Mr Ten Percent has made a lot of money from tenders. Yep - NEVER trust a politician. @Ernest Eniboy Tell me about it - politicians are more trouble than they are worth (and expensive). We should get rid of them. @Zikhona Zondani I'm flattered. The cheque is in the mail. @Cassius Mngomezulu I don't understand the difference - please explain. @makhosi nobhatyi We citizens should be unseating Ramaphosa if he doesn't deliver on his promises. "@Cassius Mngomezulu ""Black people are not corrupt"" PULEEZ" @makhosi nobhatyi So you think that Ace talking about SARB was the worst thing about his performance last night? I don't know how people vote for the ANC. Corrupt to the core. We don't know who in the ANC to listen to anymore. Contradictory messages. @makhosi nobhatyi But Ace is who the ANC members elected! Why do you expect any different? It's almost the same as ANC voters believing that the thieves in government will tackle corruption. @makhosi nobhatyi My point is that we can't depend on the ANC voters to vote for the betterment of SA. They don't think that far ahead. Trump is a chump. @Zikhona Zondani Only because their decisions and criminality affect me. I wouldn't mind if they died altogether so I wouldn't have to worry about their negative effect on SA. @Zikhona Zondani Then we can expect more of the same for the next 100 years. Criminality and plunder. @makhosi nobhatyi The ANC conference system is corrupt - people buy votes and support. Much the same as everything else the ANC touches. Or even kill opponents.
Naledzani Mashau,Ace was just blabbing (the whole party has no idea where to start with the land issue ).How can we trust them? You can trust them at your own peril "Ernest
Zee Zondani,"just here to listen to Derek @Singi Mathebula so true "I dont understand how the anc chooses its people "Ace should be premier of free state This derek fella is obsessed with the anc everything he says has the anc embedded in it "people are not risk takers I just want to take ace's position 😂😂😂😂
Cassius Mngomezulu,Black people are not corrupt but corrubtable R50- per lesson n nothing 4 mahala
Sebastian Gudu,I hope these commissions r not a waste of time we want to see heads rolling when is npa stepping in
Dams daily motivations Madamalala,Official are Easy to Corrupt e.g you are a traffic officer you earn R27 000 a month your in charge of contractors management & your facilitating R20million tender easy u get R200 000 you ofer Contract never trust a Human being
clive oconnell,The corrupted have their hands out all the time waiting for golden crumbs off the main table
Singi Mathebula,Ace is worst that any other SG ever elected . what happened at Nasrec mara!?
Benjamin Sigcu,Welcome to the party of Mandela
jett888,@zikhona zondani usually whoever is willing to be a puppet or sell their soul to the hugest bidder to do their dirty deeds for the puppeteer gets the position ❤️ but that’s just my opinion
Erastus Adolf,...but why is it that every other white folk coming to testify at the commision has to be interrogated by adv.Pritorious??..Why is it that way??? is Rajesh white?
Cerebis,@Erastus Adolf Huh??? Exactly Mbongeni! Another race baiter in the house? Adolf blocked @Tee Makara Jip....bunch of rubbish!! Proteas 2 for 24 runs! Here we go again?? @Anne M. Yes....So sad....and frustrating!! "@makhosi nobhatyi Yes @Peter Staffen You are right! I think that the Proteas is a weak team @makhosi nobhatyi 100% correct! ANC must start speaking in one voice! CR must introduce a system of only nominated person allowed to make public comments? @Tebogo Lenyora Mayor of JHB is a DA member "@Tebogo Lenyora Fine I agree "@kevindbn007 Yes "@Kapn Krunch It is very true! In my immediate family and friends circle @Zikhona Zondani Maybe he should be in jail? He was a disaster in the Free State....period! That is a huge problem as the people leaving are crucial to job creation. Government does not create jobs in spite of the political rhetoric Agree! Just look at the latest numbers from the JSE companies.....mostly down "Latest GDP numbers is a disaster! And the Unions "I block so many of these rubbish adds
Mbongeni Mapipa,"wrong thanks for removing this annoying thing 👍 proteas are playing India
Peet Venter,The wittness' expertise is matched by the evidence leader. Transnet should have adopted the same approach in March if they learnt anything of the Desember swop. "Yet they repeated the same ""mistake"". Fishy" SABC digital news please show the slides!!!!
Tee Makara,“Sexy girl” are so annoying Maybe moderators were sold to ANN7 too😏 @Frik Brits they annoying period
Anne M.,@SABC Digital News MODERATOR Please do your job @Tee Makara 😀 @Cerebis s - Oh no! The chokers reputation continues @Tebogo Lenyora Who are they playing? @Tebogo Lenyora Doesn't Afcon have pool stages? "@adrian albertyn Two actions - click on the name
Frik Brits,"@Tee Makara  "@Tee Makara 
PETER STAFFEN,Cerebis dont be mean they are an excellent side
motivation world,hello
Arjun Kumar,hai
Pat Smith,This black guy has no idea what he’s talking about
Thami Ngwenya,The man cant deal with media
kevindbn007,We just need honest ppl in government and this country will flourish "Come on ANC "So we are hearing testimony from all these ppl "as i understand it But all these weeks and nothing has come of it "that ANN7 guy revealed some damning testominy about ""certain"" high profile ANC people" "JZ being involved in the running of the station is worrying
Kapn Krunch,you think we are going to see job losses from government that's a measly affect the main reason we are going to see huge job losses is people are leaving markets are clenching cell c are losing client like everyone else we got some hard times ahead skilled workers are leaving myself my parents my brother and one side of my grandparents are the only ones still here of a family of about 30 so yeah I'm the same carteblanche did an episode on the numbers that are leaving at the moment doesn't bode well for the future of our country for every one skilled worker we lose 3 families have less money for food as we are a welfare state yes our skilled workers are also our consumers less consumers mean companies down size which results in less jobs the ancs rhetoric in parliament their blatant lies their blame shifting their announcements of radical policies without the plan on how they are going to enact those policies have led directly to this their moves to stay in power first gave investors cold feet now its given our very people could feet
Surinderjit Singh Rana,gupta family from india by covert support from gov india behind State capture South Africa
