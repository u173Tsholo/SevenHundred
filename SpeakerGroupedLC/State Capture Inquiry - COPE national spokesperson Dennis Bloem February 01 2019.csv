The Vuka Experience,Volume we can’t see SABC y’all are starting with us. Volume we can’t see Volume we can’t see Maybe they are still not paid @TK I’d like to think someone is constantly monitoring YouTube live. They forgot to turn on their mics. The camera inbuilt mic is not enough eNCA didn’t make such mistakes but Zondo kicked them out lol There we go Back on Haw mess again @SABC Digital News the Sound my guy! @Yandisa Masina 👀 Fix the sound haybo 😩 Thanks 👌🏾 Nyuku 😂😂 He speaks like a preacher 😂 Is there more damning things that Bosasa? Bloem is that one guy who is coloured but all his friends are Xhosa so he’s stuck in the middle 😂 Motlante is a national treasure. Audio SABC @Phumlani Lukhele 😂 Audio SOUND SABC My sound sounds muffled 😢 Sound is muffled. Sounds far! Sound is muffled. Sounds far And now? Sound is still bad! They sound FAR! Am I the only one with bad sound? Fix the sound damnit SOUND SOUND Sound Sound Sound Sound Sound Sound Guys I really can’t hear anything. The volume is low I have just checked the sound kula PIC commission and it’s perfect. Here is muffled @ZAR not for me and others as well I’ll come back later 🤦🏾‍♂️ sound is too bad I’m back and the sound is better 😆😆 @Fils de l’homme the term call us black people. "@Fils de l’homme of course you see colour @Makwa Choma DA doesn’t even feature in this convo Why are white people suddenly emotional? Y’all are the descendants of the most horrible regime which you tell us to forget about. ANC messes up but your forefathers presided over the worst era EVER @Mike Lock what’s wrong with being a revolutionary? "The term “BANTU” is oppressive "@Carl du Preez the past generation never atoned @Fils de l’homme that term was given to us by your forefathers. You are being passive aggressive and intentionally being racist. "@Carl du Preez we are not talking about money "@Carl du Preez that’s nothing new There are a lot of passive egressive racists here. We see you 👀 I am very much againts what the ANC did and is doing but let’s wake up. There are still apartheid companies that benefit from protected apartheid contracts and make billions. But ok! The DA involved in millions of tender irregularity in Tshwane but ok. @Fils de l’homme continue with your passive aggressive racism. @Carl du Preez first of all don’t fight land expropriation without compensation.That’s a great start. Education must be decolonised and white schools must teach the truth All schools in fact @Ixole LOUDER @White people own 73% of the land and yet they only came here with a boat and spices. Yes Gov land should be expropriated too. "@Praesesza and @Carl du Preez those are official stats from the HRC. They are facts "@Carl du Preez they specifically presented the racial composition fam I’m driving now. Later "@Praesesza and which white person came here with agricultural land? This is my point "@Praesesza and which white person came here with agricultural land? This is my point

Zondo looks like he wants to cry at what he is hearing. @makhosi nobhatyi exactly! Peterson uncovered this in 2008. The media reported on it and the ANC did nothing. They just transferred Peterson because they wanted to continue to loot the country at will. "The corruption hurts everyone I feel so bad for Zondo. He looks truly hurt. "Of course nothing changed - Zuma was running the show! He had his cohorts in place and if anyone tried to reveal it "@Sofia Sofia This gentleman is testifying and confirming everything Agrizzi said.

Cyril! @Moira T I know your DA argument. What did Cyril steal? @African Refugee Are you still Marxist? It won't be long before Bloem follow Fred Wyngaard back into the ANC. Criminals must go to jail "Bloem says ANC chair of caucus Ngwenya "Dennis Bloem I enjoy listening to DA and EFF people trying to outdo each other. Chief whip was Mbulelo Goniwe and he ended up suspended from the ANC for five years Corruption was never the policy of the ANC It was not the ANC but individuals. A non ANC member confirms what Zizi says. Values of the ANC was about the people. Thans Bloem Those who supported corruption were not following values and policies of the ANC. Thanks for your honesty Bloem. I vote ANC @Bridgette Kekana Why? Four months ago Gwede explained that he did not arrange for Bossasa to install security cameras in his houses.

That EFF-ING party a definite No only uneducated will vote EFF because they are not smart well what does education have to do with leadership? Uneducated people cannot govern just like Zuma If the EFF ever govern South Africa will become another Ethiopia and millions will perish from starvation. I hope these witnesses are in a Witness Protection safe house The ANC values have turned 360 degrees It's the same with all the countries in Africa.. sad to say it is a fact That's what I meant Robert Their is no politics here just plain greed Suspect Winnie Peterson's death was a homicide.
