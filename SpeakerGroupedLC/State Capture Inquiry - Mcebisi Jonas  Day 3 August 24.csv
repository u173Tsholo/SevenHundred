Christopher Saylee,hello why this video doesn't work
Lindikaya Myeki,Kule ntsindabadala yeGupta nceda usikhulule mfoka Jonas. Tshepang is a Gupta
kaya Nyembezi,Lasuka lahlala Take the money and not take the job 😃 "Jonas kodwa lo tata ngathi usityisa amampunge. R600million @Celiwe Mbalo R600Mil sisi @Muziwakhe Skhosana R600Mil chap and you say No. Didnt know Jesus has risen. Who is this fella?
Trucker Trucker,Mcebisi is a pathological lair. He doesn't even have evidence. "Dennis Tsotetsi He needs to provide proof of evidence on what really happened at the Gupta house. He doesn't have a witness. He claimed he was offered R600mil for position of FM. The money was in a black plastic bag He must be quizzed about how he donated vast tracts of Land in the Eastern Cape to REIPPs & facilitated Multi-Million Rand Deals for them through the EC Development Corporation which reported to him. A WHOLE R600mil? 😂😂😂Not even their mines are worth that much. Why didn't he report them to the police?LOL We are still waiting for him to open a criminal case against them for trying to bribe a govt official. Is that a requirement of the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act? Nothing explosive about those statements. Where is the evidence? "before heading to #Saxonwold Adore? Do you even know what a fact is? And spell my name correctly douchebag Mcebisi Jonas remembers that it was Ajay Gupta who threatened to kill him but can't recall which of the Gupta brothers offered him the bribe smh LOL we're referring to Sunday Times reports now? So Mcebisi Jonas only has an affidavit as evidence to his claims ? "“He said everyone must sit down "If we paraded the suspects before Mcebisi Jonas so that he can identify the ONE who attempted to bribe a deputy minister of our country "If you are threatening 2 kill me Can't wait for the cross examination to expose this Mcebisi fraud.
Lebang Lekoape,How do you know that he is a pathological lair
Dennis Tsotetsi,Tshepang Tlhapane go and tell those who are about your ill-informed shallow opinion...... GUPTA spy "I have said it long ago Jonas will survive any cross examination... he is not lying or creating stories.... Where is BLF? 8 billion down the drain to Dubai and you talk about defending the Zumas.....
Aby Gadzai,guy lets wait and know. but this commission are wasting of resources
Jeffrey Magongoe,wait Tshepang wait for testimony @Tshepang Tlhapane an opportunity to learn LAW OF EVIDENCE for others what is ANC alliance protesting about now 8 billion to Dubai then an african child stays hungry with proper education supporters of GUPTAS must be ashamed
Sibusiso Nkosi,The thief who looted cash from PE looks scared 😳 "True Romeo Moyo
Zanele K,HE SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE MONEY BECAUSE EVERYONE IN GOVERNMENT IS CORRUPT
Thanduxolo Mgca,Butternut must come and account "this guy saved us from Zuma "Gupta removed minister 3 times in a year "he told Zuma on national television "live tribalist they will never tell the truth "me and you fighting to get back the land "John block run away after long court battle
The Edge Search,What I need to know from Mcebisi what legal steps did he took before going to media to report this Gupta crime "I need to know which evidence does Mcebisi have in writing
Phyllis Kumalo,He is a liar the date he mention he was with Duduzane nd the Guptas was wrong Duduzane was not there nd he has proof of where he was in that day He shows us proof of he was not with Mcebisi in dat day Mcebisi claim he was with them in the ANN7 Hilton this is not the end the more truth will come all the ppl he mention they will respond nd tell us their side of their story
Siyabulela Mtywaku,@Tshepang Tlhapane imagine mfethu... Namhlanje uzochopha ayichaze...
Desmond Masilela,Hi Guys. Is this guy going to read all this document that he have? did he record this somewhere on his Cell phone or his just saying with no prove? Thank you @ Chris Pretorius "If the truth comes out Hahahahaha...... @Maskandimusic onlive ... it doesnt make sense. @ Maskandimusic at first he said they drove to Saxonworld now they fly. where did we leave his car?
Nosiphiwo Zantsi,@The Edge Search Mcebisi did not report to the media# Mcebisi Jonas made a statement under oath in front of the Public Protector.
makhosi nobhatyi,How can you be so sure if Duduzane is not lying? Criminal always defend himself or herself It’s R600 000 first up in hand then once he agreed to take the position then 6mil be paid later stage Am not surprised with you mthobisi Zuma It is Gupta to interupt
Mdumiseni Khumalo,aiy no this Leager is not srs
Amooo Ndlovu,"State resources is being abused here Afrikaans? Afrikaans marete It’s 600 000 not 600 million Mthobisi do u think old man like Jonas can lie?😂 "Fils de please stop with Afrikaans I think we should block this idiot

Keke khura,600 mill Elizabeth just ignore this idiot tell him Philani 😂 because he is scared he is reading his statement it was gonna be cash @ general R600 000 in cash immediately not R600m
mashudu timoty Rabothata,Really
peter pott,how do you pin the fmr president to this allegation. This kite won't fly in court of law This will sound like a hearsay "diotlo "how I the world does someone just sear next to the witness "zee "it's weak really to identify so many mistakes now "badkamer "Holmes "Ramatshela next time take pictures jonas! you see Amarosa recorded the President and certain staff members "hate him or love him "jonas is skelm too "weakness too "did he say "Now Mr jonas This begins to sound like the bold and the beautiful "come on deputy finance minister! you don't report to Nene "don't cry now "This matter must not go to court of law "so pravin "his lawyers are scratching their heads "yes who leaked the information to the FT? "he refused to serve as mayor in Nelson Mandela bay "This was an infighting of anc "This commission got potential of costing us R920 million "Look at it today "enough now! zuma is gone. Pravin must sort incomes of eskom staff "This is wrong "zealous! I am glad you mentioned that. that's my point exactly "matolong "jonas is low on sugar adv mokoena is giving to many answers than questions "assume This is the best study case for law students "jonas "what I am happy of from this commission is that my grandfather Deputy CJ can retire and also built his own fire pool with that weight he won't survive. Cuba heat. heart attack "lawyers love Pres Zuma "so who leaked it to the FT and Sunday Times? when only praying ....pravin This is reduced to a Hollywood gossip column sacp are now outside. They realize thuma mina only open gates for whites corporates adv mokoena do you wanna take the witness stand sir? "the judge is hungry why did jonas bring his lawyers? "fana "pres zuma is watching this having a sip of lemonade "sacp is frustrated too "petrol price is rising "Louw "even then "take a hid "CNN is busy fighting Trump "here is an advice Jonas. if you continue talking like this "your approach in.all this is hugely wrong. you giving them undeserved airtime. explain to us "he is saying this for the fourth time new "body language suggests I am tired "you were both in London "Tumelo "probably "listen to this two. They are not economists t "let's go to court "pres ramaphosa was in government
Celiwe Mbalo,Oh tjo! Ewe Fils stop with afrikaans Bra please Elizabeth u are in a hurry like me. "Philani Madlala
Mthobisi Zuma,mcebisi 'Pathological liar jonas captured himself @Michael Holmes why dont u go to police since it seems u have proof that they out to kill him it is reharsed "pravin was not in treasury that time your hero
Hlalanathi Mbimbi,R1 000 000 000 000 000 000
Auti Mjita,uZuma lied everyday nje "yes it is rehearsed
Siyabonga Ndlovu,Now the inquiry start
Victor,How can the prosecutor dont know? This sounds like fiction
Elizabeth Diotlo,"this is circus Fils de l'homme what you on about? "5 minutes is up how do we block? i will gladly block him LoL Phila And it has began.. "They said it was Jonas lawyer "i see that Zee John was saying the Indian guy is jonas lawyer not Mokoena "They got to him "Not at all Sizwe Even these Inquiries are a waste of time cause no criminal charges will come out of them... Where politicians are concerned no criminal charges shall prevail. yes Marvel NPA do have evidence but they are sitting on it not prosecuting anyone "LOl Eish Michael it is so sad hey Jonas has now relaxed and he is becoming confident... Lol Gupta's have information on him and the one's close to him "Zee he has written them down "The ""old man""" "600 million was offered "Lol yes Michael we will varaza it Oh my! They had R600m In cash! Mr Gupta had repeated that they had information on him and if he says anything about that meeting they would kill him True that Qhawe Why is Nene not coming forward? or is he one of the witnesses that will be called ? he is also a human being who knows what they said to him prior to this inquiry "If they can threaten him then That was heat hey! Tshepang you may say that but why would he lie? This affidavits 🙄
Jan Badkamer,@Fils de l'homme low effort bro so low effort ;/ @Elizabeth Diotlo clean your ears "its not a lawyer "@peter pott this is common btw we'll see. Not sure why these guys get a special comission... The rest of us just get jail cells until we prove ourself in court. @Sizwe Nkambule you shouldn't be concerned. corrections are commonplace humans make mistakes 😃 LOL @ talking like a radio lol
Tyron Louw,Elizabeth he is just trolling everyone. Ignore. "Sometimes "Adam
Blaze 613,"ek is n rooinek
Philani Madlala,while we are here can I make it be known the we will take the land. we will also remove that Afrikaans part from the national anthem p "I am not gonna lie I would have taken the R600 I would take it and run 😭😭😭. I once took money as a loan from Fnb and I ran after😭😭😭. so why not 600 million? so how many other ministers are still hiding that sold their souls to the guptas WOW I love Jonas
Romeo Mavuso,go to his comment and click on the three dots then report him Jonas' lawyer is the Indian guy not Advocate Mokoena.Just for clarity "Michael is right That means people must approach media houses for evidence Marvel just said there's evidence by the NPA.Angsazingeni They wanna die martyrs "lol maybe its Ajay "Judge Zondo's voice though.Tjerrr
anthony bassie,how long is 5 min again? """with due respect"" stop pulling that smug face and start being serious and nail the perpetrators" """am sorry Mr cimmisioner"" you are delaying this enquiry with you're am sorry..."

Ndumiso Peso,why can't Malema & Juma reunite and take the land back
Mthobisi Busane,has he revealed people's name guy? this is just a waste of time
Onyango Erick,South Africa right??
Zee Zee,this Jonas is sweating and shaking already how does he remember all these? I know I mean when he wrote his statement how did he remember all the details "Jonas was just chatting with his friend u should have told J. Zuma the one who appointed you. Instead of telling your friends. I trusted this guy so much but he's disappointing me. "I'm still waiting for something concrete so now u are sure its Ajay yet u said u dont know them with my matric i can simply cross examine this guy blah blah blah this is a joke so he remembers every detail I''m still waiting for the evidence that he was offered 600m not just stories
Sizwe Nkambule,I am seriously concerned that such specific details have incorrectly been represented and changed this morning. Its these changes that will weaken the case put forward by Jonas
Philani ngcobo,Who want to kill him Michael? Can you prove your allegations? "Romeo we are today because of news you are talking about I can't wait to see him answering questions from their lawyers. where else can I watch proceedings with no two videos on my screen????? thanks buddy
Lindokuhle Mnisi,@Michael Holmes hahahaha Hahahahaha Jonas found out on TV that he was fired. Hahaha "Wow "@Marvel Ramatshela they drove in Duduzane's 2 door mac. Not a state vehicle. Rewind Badlala ago Mr Mbeje laba yazi. It's not Mzwandile's fault. The producers are subotaging him.
Marvel Ramatshela,Politicians in this country always get special treatment when they have to face the law for their criminality. Ordinary citizens are sent to jail before they could even say their names. Not fair. "NPA has all the evidence to persecute these clowns. SARS Imagine knowing that you've been fired through the media😥😥 "Now it seems most of these politicians are corruptible "Buy why did he go there from the 1st place loool😂😂😂
Kgahliso Solo,This is just a waste of time and money.
