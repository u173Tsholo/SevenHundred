Joel Mzayidume,hello ahoy!

"focus Walter and Tymo can continue talking rubbish Adv Maleka is on the ball. Mr Ephron is beginning to fumble already hello? i can't see anyone else's comment @mandisi ntauzana we are Zondo's people "Indeed @Quintin Jacobs I wish Prof Terreblanche were still alive so he could have educated Zondo on State Capture @rohan barnard he was Professor of economics at Stellenbosch University. A former member of the National Party's negotiation team during talks with the ANC in the 90s @rohan barnard visit https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/co-optation-african-national-congress-south-africas-original-state-capture-sampie You're welcome @rohan barnard
Desmond Masilela,hi guys Any update in regard of Jason Rohde sentencing? 8 may 2019 @Thando Nkutha. Me too I only block the racist "@rohan barnard. It is not enough I think it was about defeating the hands of justice. @rohan barnard. I think so either. but the murder itself was 15yrs behind bars. Which in my opinion it was not enough for someone who planned for this. @rohan barnard. 100% agree with you. Cases like this should be at least from 25yrs upwards. @rohan barnard. Yes agree with you. But I think the law of SA is too lenient. Imagine in 10yrs time the guy will be out on Parole. @rohan barnard. It wont change at all.
