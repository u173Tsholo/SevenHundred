Joel Mzayidume,hello ahoy! Hi @Desmond Masilela I've no clue who that individual is @tymo what are you talking about "which war are you referring to Morning @Innocent Madamalala he even gets escorted by JMPD. I wonder what the Joburg Mayor had to say on this "whose renewal "Glencore CEO "better deal with that irritation "uPule no Zizi baya bhonyelwa ngama elections "war by women Zondo is astute and asks smart questions. "focus Walter and Tymo can continue talking rubbish Adv Maleka is on the ball. Mr Ephron is beginning to fumble already hello? i can't see anyone else's comment @mandisi ntauzana we are Zondo's people "Indeed @Quintin Jacobs I wish Prof Terreblanche were still alive so he could have educated Zondo on State Capture @rohan barnard he was Professor of economics at Stellenbosch University. A former member of the National Party's negotiation team during talks with the ANC in the 90s @rohan barnard visit https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/co-optation-african-national-congress-south-africas-original-state-capture-sampie You're welcome @rohan barnard
Desmond Masilela,hi guys Any update in regard of Jason Rohde sentencing? 8 may 2019 @Thando Nkutha. Me too I only block the racist "@rohan barnard. It is not enough I think it was about defeating the hands of justice. @rohan barnard. I think so either. but the murder itself was 15yrs behind bars. Which in my opinion it was not enough for someone who planned for this. @rohan barnard. 100% agree with you. Cases like this should be at least from 25yrs upwards. @rohan barnard. Yes agree with you. But I think the law of SA is too lenient. Imagine in 10yrs time the guy will be out on Parole. @rohan barnard. It wont change at all.
tymo,when are you going to be warriors and fight like men instead of chickens @Joel Mzayidume and you guys do nothing about it @michael mbatha you are weak..you rather kill your own fellow african for nothing but leave the white man that owns and control your land while you suffer in poverty and townships with nothing @michael mbatha nothing belongs to you in african you thieve @Walter Du Plessis you only act on people who own shops but you dont act on that white man that has your land while you suffer in poverty @michael mbatha soon you going back either by boat or plane..@Walter Du Plessis lol you going home doesnt matter what you say you going home @Walter Du Plessis you going home boat or plane soon @Walter Du Plessis eff will deport you @Walter Du Plessis lol look at how your white master is talking and you do nothing lol @michael mbatha you enemies of africans we will feed you to lions soon @Walter Du Plessis we will just wait and see you'll be the first crying like you doing now with your GENOCIDE @Walter Du Plessis you enemies and thieves watch and see you looted too much already @Walter Du Plessis you going home soon @Jack Sparrow am just having fun with these enemeies and soon lions are coming to feast on them @Sandile Khowane they messing with wounded lions and these thieves are soon going home lol is go to school not bto @Walter Du Plessis we will start with you feed toy to lion s @Walter Du Plessis where you then give location if you are brave kikikiki coward @Walter Du Plessis i have and i look like a warrior not a coward like you kikiki @Walter Du Plessis you'll be fed to lions soon for messing with wounded lion coward @Walter Du Plessis lol lions are coming for you soon dont think you can mess with wounded lion forever lol have you seen a rebus monkey? it looks like you check it out @Walter Du Plessis lions are coming for you i know you already thinking about hiding like a coward you are @Walter Du Plessis look at that big nose lol you can even fit my fist up in it @Walter Du Plessis the little ran away from the lion i miss him already please get him back here @Joel Mzayidume where is this little cat? as usual they ran away from lions @Walter Du Plessis They going home soon the wounded lions is awakening oh the wounded african lions awaken yourselves and chase these cats away from scavenging our land and resources They take advantage of wounded lions but the lions are getting up slowly just watch and see once the lions fully get up the cats shall be scrubbing our streets the sword will be sharp like a knife cutting through butter the wounded lions will soon feast on these cats viva to all my wounded and awaken healing lions soon we will regain our strength to feast on these cats 123 lions are coming for you 🤺 lion is chilling here and will not take the words of a small cat @Andre Gerber lol zuma was a puppet for the little cats but wait and see zuma and little cats will be all consumed by the lions @Andre Gerber 🦁🦁🦁 viva my lions 🦁🦁🦁 no one will mess with wounded lions again once we get up this time

CR faction is now pushing and secured IPP contracts how can Eskom buy elect from these NOT KNOWN producers and selling it to customers at a LOSS that is state capture i hope bery soon somebody can e-publish the CODESA minutes and the sunset clauses *very i dont trust lawyers no one is born a racist ........... racism is instilled in them 3 categories of discrimination Race Class & Gender rohan so true Makho the Guptas biggest mistake is to take on the the coal cabal must say the commission is now giving free classes of contracts makhosi HE is here to justify and selling the narrative that cost plus mines is BEST for Eskom

David van Wyk,The minefield of a country we live in... from animals to colours to what did you ACTUALLY mean... seriously okes... have we lost our ability to communicate... Perhaps someone could list all the words that may not be used in South Africa.... I hear you Makho... its sometimes subtle... and must be addressed... agreed... but gosh... it can be a minefield... Racism is a manifestation of an inferiority complex... an attempt to look down on another - a feeble attempt to boost your own low self esteem or a pathetic inability to recognise equality. I thought colours was a no no 😃
