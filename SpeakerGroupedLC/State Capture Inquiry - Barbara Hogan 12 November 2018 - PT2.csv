Marvel Ramatshela,"Guys they must come back from lunch now "17 mins later "let's not forget that this commission was Estimated to cost us R230M if run for six months not sure "According to my quick maths Already the implicated are busy selling off thier asserts and or changing thier ownership using thier cousins and what not. we won't get much from them "I hope the Chairperson is not poisoned like David Mabuza @Xolile - lol just saying hey. anything is possible in S.A. Zuma was also poisoned in USA remember..😀 Gama and Games - same WhatsApp group.. "Lot of corruption happened in Eskom and Transnet. Billions were wasted and stolen there. Denel now can't pay salaries I can't believe that 2 little brothers came and captured our country over curry. Disgusting and sad😢😢😢 Only Tony Yengeni went to jail for that stupid ML bought with corruption money "ANC MPs and thier executives in SOEs & Municipalities are ALLLLLLLL corrupt "@Russel "what a shame in your ruling party What if there were no Gupta email leaks..??🤔 "Our State Security Agency failed to protect this country "As long we still have Mokonyane "Was Sunday Times reliable then "We'll recover after 25 full years "Jeff Radebe a has been a minister for 24 years now "I wish to see Jeff Radebe's pension She's not the best witness but we appreciate her afforts. "@Desmond - I agree "Maybe it's because expected better from her L "Duduzane is barred from living the country until further notice "Yes "Ramaphosa My conclusion: Everyone seems to be implicated in state capture except the poor.. "@Timoty - If he can't fire Bathabile Are people allow to just linger around while judge is still on Chair? It's annoying hey @Zamo - Certainly but he mustn't abuse our support as it can be short lived. we need abl we need more actions than warm speeches @Zamo - but they had a consil they had a constitution and PFMA to guide them. not to take all of Zumas crap "They have no excuse to act otherwise The evidence leader is somewhat not the best I'll wait for Wednesday to hear what Gordhan has to say "@Joseph

Barbara ! Jeff Radebe is a vulture. He is always close to the President (who ever it is) The Zuma Faction ruined this country @Hlalanathi Mbimbi true
Eugene Fray,its after lunch chats hahahahahhaahah I love that chair it looks super comfy and super pricy per case and per hour or per second these guys don't play with KFC guys these are Nandos guys where the chicken went to a model C school what is real as we are being made to believe so much and then they turn around and say its false we are being brainwashed while there are bigger deals being done behind the scenes Then its time for a clean up but who will be left to run the country? Seriously why does each party get a term and lets see how it goes but big decisions should be a combined decision Joseph they answer what they feel is the best without being trapped Joseph Its when you have something to hide but you not sure to what degree you can disclose the matter without being prosecuted yourself "these guys are whistle blowers and can't be implicated in anything or else their evidence is not credible Thando as much as I agree I also think coloured people also need the land ok you might feel that way but not all see it like that Eugene DT: thats a very important question
Charlene Botha,Mr Delivery was late.....give him a break...
Sthakathi Khumalo,Who is playing idibala in the background Maria Ramos again!!

"monyane tumelo please tell them I hate it when people say black people need education about land. what education.. blackpeople can work the land. problem is wealthy land is only for select few!! "noko yamebetlwa fair enough bro Nlisi Thole indeed!! state capture smells like a factional battle to access resources!! The ANC are really not fit to lead us. We seriously need an alternative and not their graduates called EFF "Hlalanathi Mbimbi To be honest

JK SEDU,Zuma did well to chase away all these lairs as Ministers. Just listen to this woman lying like this. Sies man! TRC and CODESA Captured is big time! She’s lying again! 🙊 So Gordhan is the one organising all this nonsense?? She’s lying. Who gave Gordhan is permission to share state documents to this woman?? Was she vetted?? So this is the same Barbara Horgan who’s been calling herself Kathrada Foundation🙊 Awelani you are too excited since Cyril became president. He’s not Musanda wa Thathe but President. Please sit down! Why is Noko such a huge tribalist?? WMC Cabinet wants to come back all of it. Just look at how she’s trying hard! 🙊 Zondo Commission must investigate the origins of Mvelaphanda & Shanduka then we’ll be 80% done with the real State Capture. When is Desmond Tutu appearing?? WMC beneficiaries came here with answers already. They believe all the lies to try keep other groups from making business with Government. Just check comments. United all the way 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 90% of SA is owned by our beloved Oubaases. We must dehlfejd them. We can’t allow Guptas to try steal business from them. It’s wrong! Guptas took a huge risk. Us Africans do stationery and catering business. Why did they touch our Oubaases business? That’s wrong! Let’s fight for our Oubaases gents! Atul was wrong to try mining and Energy business. We Africans are allowed to do only catering. They took a huge risk! 🙆🏾‍♂️ Heeeee Banna! She’s lying again! 🙊 "Eugene it’s true But why did Guptas try to take business from our Oubaases?? That was risky! can’t understand why Guptas tried to steal big Gvt business from our Oubaases who own 80% of SA wealth. Now see how the landless use all t😌energy & budget to chase 1 family. Bantu Education comedy Evidence???? 🤷🏾‍♂️

Tamaryn Petersen,julius again supporting criminals grow up musa what does her weight have to do with anything? she's making a huge contribution here and you focus on that. shame suppose you have no faults?
Eslon Eslon,State capture is an ANC orchastred scheme that's coming to hunt them... ANC knew what they were doing when replaced Thambo Mbeki with the crook called Msholozi South Africans don't just only blame Msholozi for the state capture shenanigans but the ANC for knowingly making a corrupt candidate head of state "Cyril must stay out of the SABC debacle and leave it for its management
Paul Ndlovu,I hope this states captured will bring people in to book not wasting states resources

Hlalanathi Mbimbi,Yessss By the time this is all concluded and there are serious consequences it will be too late Exactly... state funds going down the drain once again... I guess this should have went to trial not a commission then recommendation to the court @Monique Jones So much powerful @Monique Jones How does Duduzani go to Dubai given his current unfolding court case of culpable homicide... Ohhhh so did he made an application through the court @Monique Jones Transparency to the fees of these commission should be detailed so to know what it means to have members of the state that are incompetent and corrupt to the core... 😂😂@Thando Nkutha what alternative is there? @Sthakathi Khumalo The ANC @Keryn What do you mean? @noko yamebetlwa 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 @Joseph Thobejane
