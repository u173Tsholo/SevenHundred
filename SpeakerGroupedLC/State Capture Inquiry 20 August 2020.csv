watson mutanga,I wish they could surprise us by starting at 10am on the dot. Why do the evidence leaders have to stand all the time whilst the criminals giving evidence are sitting comfortably? @Antoinette Meyer: his difficulties with the English language could be a blessing in that it may mean that he gives short and straightforward answers. Chair seemed uninterested. Party cadres have to have jobs and are deployed strategically. There are posts that require the most intelligent but they deploy the least intelligent so as to use them in carrying out nefarious acts.

Melvict Melbourne,Who is with MTI? It is not VBS was licensed and a ponzi I trade with my own computer. have written code that does the transactions and make money. MTI does the same. 'Fact' ..where is the evidence? The problem is that there are R2.9 bn not in the hand of the banks. Why can't you make 0.1-0.6 % per day? some days you make -03% Bot that does trading is not new. Bot's can process trends and data much faster than humans. they sell and buy not on emotion. The best general was Idi Amin. Why do need drivers? so that they can have both hands free to steal Tomorrow is Friday!!! many ministers in theNP drove themselves. George since when does brigadiers do investigations? oops one dead brick thrower... marvelous this guy is now starting to peddle water one investigation investigating another investigating. He doesn't have a smart watch What is the aim of the commission? Cadres only volunteer to do something when they can steal "O Sullivan is everywhere Which are?
Quin Mokoena,😂😂😂 he's so pressed! sorry y'all I entered this live late who's this guy
Christian W,@Melvict Melbourne MTI is ponzi skeem "trust me there are no evidence of their trading "just get your money out before it collapses

Meetings are all random apparently. "Saxonwold meeting area "“I don’t remember Brigadiers take care of the communal beer fridge Took the phone without a subpoena. Criminal offence Hahaha forgot he took it while getting some cigarettes on Marlboro drive So no reason for a subpoena ¿ no implication in the crime and they still seized it? Did they just read out someone’s I’d o Wild No warrant To act as a commission
MysticWolf,"Here's a 'fact': 2 + 2 is 4
Barries Barnard,They break things.
Dominic Przybylski,"Our minister of police is called ""General Cele"" despite having qualified only as a school teacher." "@Antoinette Meyer I don't know about police but to obtain military rank there is formal training and qualification required to attain rank where ""general"" is equivalent to phd." Brigadier seems to be an honorary rank for comrades. In the military a brigadeer is usually in charge of three to six battalions (1000 per battalion). Does anyone know if and how it differs in police force? lol I suspect that high ranking officers in SAPS and SANDF outnumber low ranking officers. Any stats out there?
DANIEL MKHABELA,All thugeries is not remembered by perpetrators cause they don't want to incremenate themselves. Is by choice not to remember. the witness self doesn't know what he is testifying about he can't even find page numbers in front of him. are you aware that most witnesses before the commission especially those from anc don't remember anything about all corrupt activities they have done. they are in a dream land. help me understand has zandile gumede cleared her name
DJNaija,"It is proper for retired military officers above the rank of Captain to continue to use their military rank as their formal title (instead of ""Mr"") However that is not the protocol for the police." What did George Fivaz call himself after he left the SAPS? poor man. out of his intellectual depth Mr. P O'Sullivan once went into Alex (Jhb) for an investigation. This was when he was a SAPS reservist. In the course of this endeavor a suspect dropped his partner with a brick to the head. Paul shot the suspect dead Imagine - this Brigadier is in charge of 100's SAPS members. We are lead! Just gave us her ID new Edgars account here i come. Oh ... wait His Attorney thankfully speaks at normal speed
Le Roux Strydom,😜
Pheladi Lamola,I don't know why but I'm feeling sorry for this man.
Mandla J Ngubeni,"I just tuned in Ok
Tebogo Sibilanga,In SAPS a brigadier is someone who gets parachuted into a position he/she does not deserve as long as he/she is politically connected You defeated yourself
mafuta,"I think this fella was a part time poacher and became known as "" bring a deer "" when invited to mates braai's."
Bophelo Malapela,Police do not know the law
Nghamula Nkuna,That is how it works Watson.
Richard Lukhele,"I merely think we may have to redefine corruption And will sponsore my understanding at som "Look many inaccuracies here
Priscilla Stellah,@Elton...u quite ryt ...wht. a waste of tym
