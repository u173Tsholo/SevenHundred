dave east,guys its a serious question. if we as black men dont control anything why would our women be joining femenist groups to fight for womens groups but not for pan Africanism white women are not suffering as women. in reality they inherite their wealth and privileges from white mens successes we are a people who have racism to deal with not gender based violence issues or womens issues i need answers to my questions. im here to debate for the benefit of black people white patriarchs control money land and jobs in south africa. so why are our black women fighting for womens rights when we are poor people thando cool i rant with myself im here to spark conversations ok i will spark my own direction this wont influence no change @ thando guys its a serious question. if we as men dont control anything why would our women be joining femenist groups to fight for womens groups but not for pan Africanism white patriarchs control land money and jobs in South Africa and are all white men. black men dont control anything yet they are black femenist groups intend to fight us in reality white women fight for feminism also makes no sense other then to cause a rift between black men and women. white women recieve privilege because their men are in power and aren't really discriminated against. hey mateðŸ˜Š

YOT Society Records,In reality SA Should be talking more about creating South African Banks to preserve south african resources including capital. We can't be banking internationally while our economy is not stable.
Jesus is Coming,Fuzile would have prior to submitting this evidence asked Mr Godongwana to include the sms conversation .
D B,Wondering why the evidence leader did not ask Fuxile what he thought of the info from Gdongwana. Whether he did not think it was odd.
Ipfi Nekhubvi,"why didnt maleka handle PG
