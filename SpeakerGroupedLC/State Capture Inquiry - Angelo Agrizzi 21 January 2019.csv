ST James Rama,Smallanyana skeletons are running around i see 💀 Agrizzi is speaking the truth just like someone who is about to die tjeer... He must be given a plea bargain after this.... He has revealed a lot The big one was the Siyanqoba Rally obviously I don't buy this whole Ramaphosa story about cleaning up corruption! He justs wants us to vote ANC again Tuneful i hear you! they can eat the money but they must also look after us not just themselves and their families... What made Mr Agrizzi to come out and spill the beans SA must change the way we elect the President! Sindiswa! So they tried to kill him? Is the President following this Inquiry... That OR Tambo heist i also heard that government officials were involved CICA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I agree Jeevan Chris Hani was killed by the ANC Did everyone just get disconnected or was it just me?

Uncle A,Last election was the last time ANC got my vote....EFF NEVER. Innocent aint so innocent after all... He provides us with this crap. How does one block a person attempting to divert this into a racist conversation. I'm gonna prepare pamphlets and distribute all this info to my circle who does not have access to data.
Thabani Mthethwa,ANC is dead. Bathabile said every NEC member has skeleton nyana I'm sure there also corruption scandals on E tolls contracts There is no honesty in politics @True Tech. Other governments take care of it people though Being loyal to a party that has been proven to be corrupt and yet soldier on to vote for it is beyond stupidity. I'm sure Innocent also got tenders from ANC "When the capacity of reasoning is small and you can""t handle the truth It True Mfundo Veerasamy. We can't expect a better country with people that has a mentality to continue support the bacteria that slowly eat our country
jeevan singh,Cannot vote ANC anymore. The EFF is going to bury the ANC now. done and dusted. It's over. South Africa was captured for 24 years by Bosasa and the ANC were living like Kings. The world is watching this. The end of the ANC what delivery? our Black people are suffering and dying like flies in poverty and the ANC are living in luxury. Shame ANC bloody shame. 20 wasted years of corruption. The ANC must be removed fro. power. Patience. I don't know yet. Still to decide. I like the EFF. definately not the ANC anymore. "I think you are wrong. if the EFF don't like me it's for the right reason. if I am wrong then I must change. so must Black there is 3 points. Gavin Watson is no Christmasfather. so it's bribe. Chris Hani assination. Polish puppet. Now we got an Italian singing bird. Am almost sure ANC behind Chris Hani assination. the sound is clear my side. The ex cop who delivers the money Sopela is going to to disappear. Or taken out. He is the kingpin here.

Gopolang Mokalaka,Taking from the poor....corrupt maaahfkrs!!!
bonginkosi christopher monakali,ANC is not Corrupted - is the president of that period who is corrupted.
samuel masale,I said it when this commission started that it is the end of the ANC. Talk is cheap but delivery is difficult. Competent people are roaming in the street with qualifications whereas incompetent ones are sitting in lavish offices. Those who are implicated should just appear before the commission and clear their names.

Gideon A Vele,@True Tech is legal with conditions zondo must save this guy in order to save the reliability of his evidence in future. and also to retain his status as a credible witness. @CICA - Crime Intelligence & Community Awareness a bribe on its own is a crime whether it had influence or not.
Solomon Mamushi,Corruption was institutionalized and made to look normal. Implicated leaders must be personally held accountable. The DA is an offspring of the apartheid national party. They changed it from NP to New national party then DA. how can you trust such a party with your vote?

CICA - Crime Intelligence & Community Awareness,BOSASA has done the security at O R Tambo International Airport for many years. Last week Angelo Agrizzi showed a video where a BOSASA director asked for R10 000 cash to pay for a remote control... "who says the R10 000 for a ""remote control"" was not to bribe someone to open a cargo gate illegally .... who says all this cash that was paid did not come from the massive cash heists at the airport?" so he is saying that the bribes did not bring any benefit????? Now he has just let all the corrupt government officials off the hook because they can now say they never influenced any contracts "He should possibly have explained his statement about ""when in Africa do as Africans do"" and how that is a figure of speech from when in Rome @Apfeswaho Vele you have a point yes. However this guy is weakening the case. is it maybe intentional WHAT IF WE HAVE ALL MISSED THE REAL CRIMES? What if all that cash came from the massive heists of USD at OR Tambo international airport? "Everytime you see VAT being paid with your hard earned money on a till slip @Magda Seguin - yes that's what he says... what if some of it was also from the massive cash heists which occurred at OR Tambo International Airport where BOSASA had massive influence and contracts? "Everyone... take note. When you see PAYE deductions coming from your hard earned payslip @Rejoice musrurwa you have a point yes. Clearly all is not as it seems @Magda Seguin go back to sleep. @Magda Seguin if you were involved in massive cash heists would you give evidence about it? Or would you try distract with elaborate stories of cash laundering only being linked to tenders? @Rejoice musrurwa exactly just you @Desmond that's what we think @UNdlunkulu Xoli research the massive Cash heists which occurred at OR Tambo International Airport... USD heists ... @UNdlunkulu Xoli https://ewn.co.za/2017/03/21/more-details-emerge-to-clarify-confusion-over-or-tambo-lamborghini-suspect Last week Angelo Agrizzi showed a video where a BOSASA director was asking about R10 000 for a remote for the high security cargo gate at OR Tambo International Airport and the SAPS control room... Remember the massive heists which happened at OR Tambo International Airport? Ask yourself whether it is impossible that BOSASA and others were involved @Mfundo Veerasamy yes agreed - at least he helped expose this. Luckily not all companies operate this way "@Rejoice musrurwa apparently they paid Correctional Services to get tenders. Maybe they also paid for dangerous perpetrators to be ""lent"" to them for crimes and high risk work" WHY IS GAVIN WATSON NOT IN A HOLDING CELL YET? (In a prison which is not managed by BOSASA) Boys & girls... as usual the SABC audio engineers are useless ... everyone else also getting audio feedback? well said @Houws Houlinou "Boys and girls ... everytime you see VAT going off your pay slip Even those amounts in one year is more than most people salary and these pigs got it every month "How can someone taking cash have ""integrity""?" The grey money bags were shown and explained last week in the video SABC FIX THE AUDIO... Some zombie is standing on a wire They probably paid a SABC technician to mess up the audio at crucial points you have a point Desmond... Someome paid to distort audio while names are discussed boom They fixed the corrupt technicians intentional error Yes it's fixed now Singh "What if this is all a cover up for the massive USD cash heists from cargo area & airplanes at OR Tambo International Airport? Maybe some of the money comes from those? BOSASA did airport ""security""" "Ever wondered about all the OR Tambo International Airport ""followings""? Where busloads of tourists were followed & held up at gunpoint? Who gave Intel out to criminals?"
