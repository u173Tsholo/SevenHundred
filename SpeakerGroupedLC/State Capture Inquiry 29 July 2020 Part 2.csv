FredBKevin,Why was all our police ministers corrupt? lols Elderman Wie is die grapjas And that Tie lols
Gugulethu Xhosans,The guy is so full of himself Shem Nhleko .He is cracking @jwarha21 u are delusional
Mduduzi comfort Dlamini,where is the musk sir
Arthur Dell,FredBKevin to become a minister you need to be corrupt. Andre van Schalkwyk while I agree with you 100% I do have a problem with criminals such as our governent and this witness who is obviously trying to deceive all!! Keven so am I and 8million others This witness answers quick and staright forward indicating he telling the truth!! This state capture enquir has cost the taxpayer R400 million and who has been jailed or made to repay? "Hubert that is a bit rough "@Hubert so you are saying all people are corrupt
Cedric John,when you try to answer too cautiously you make room for suspicion
Alvino Theunissen,So true Arthur He is Exposed he victimized McBride..leave the rest! Lying through his teeth! Bypass Mcbride ...he is😂🤣 caught out! Agree @Nic van As Notshe is Back what a headache him and the Chair together @ Redeemed Sinner 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂 my thoughts as well but all pretends to let the clowns get away
Mr Green,Kwenzakalani lana? Adv is also beating about the bush... Lol...
Martin van der Breggen,A General is a Clerk??? serious clerk then.... lets here this one "body language tells such a awesome story......I was not actually listening
itumeleng angelinna,he's getting irritated this guys and his examples @hunter lol he isn't going to make it... this guy going to waste time on purpose
MysticWolf,I want some Oros
Dominic Przybylski,"Lieutenant General used to be called commandant in old SADF """All governed by principles of accountability"" Eh?" I wonder WHICH principles of accountability he and his political party are governed by? An analysis is a view Can't believe that Nhleko as former minister of police doesn't understand the fundamentals of what a view/allegation/view/anaylysis is! Every case in court is a contest between two different VIEWs. This is hilarious. Why is Zondo answering for him? Zondo definitely seems to be blocking Hulley at critical moments in his questioning. @Godfrey Mama Eh? It's not Hulley who has been wasting time. Give us a break Zondo. Please don't interrupt again within the next 10 minutes. "Now all of a sudden he can answer with a simple ""yes""" Karma catches all. Al Bashir now jailed in his own country. Some to the nicest people I've met are criminals. Who needs somebody else to be their Lord. Christ was misinterpreted when he said the Lord and I are one. He meant we each be our own lord. @Kevin Lol. or the lord is a sinner. same thing I guess. My underpants are holy. @TheTruthShall SetYouFree I am very sure of myself. I can stand on my own two feet. I have no need for a spiritual or religious crutch. I like Buddhism. It's one of the only religions which doesn't pretend to represent something for which there is no evidence. @TheTruthShall SetYouFree Buddhism is about enlightenment. Unlike the religions of Arabic origin does not claim to represent an absolute truth but rather that each person has to find their own truth. @TheTruthShall SetYouFree There is speculation that he actually was a Buddhist monk. Which truth is that @TheTruthShall SetYouFree? "Heh Pandemics are inevitable. Wow! R60 000 for how many nights? @Malesela Cassius Lamola difference between an honest witness and a dishonest one.
Sammy Mashamba,It's so freaking annoying and disrespectful for Nhleko to respond nonsensically bullish to Hulley SC just to respond nicely to the Commissioner DCJ Zondo. "'An Investigative Report is not based on views
makhosi nobhatyi,This guy is a liar 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ n think he is smart Yes they got him now 😂😂🤪🤪 Why do you by pass McBride sir? "He run away now This is taking time by dwelling with simple answer
R hunter,this man needs to see a doctor! Has accountability issues ...has he done a breath test yet? Think he is on planet 'papsak'! here it comes Ha ha ha what a Mampara....talking gibberish! "I'm gonna start a tv channel ha ha what an idiot! Welcome to Planet Nlecko 🚽 Denial is not a river in Africa... bla bla bla... 😅🤣🤣🤣 "TEKKEN - ""FINISH HIM""" am losing faith in Chief Zondo at a rapid rate!
Ridwaan Ismail,this guy are up to mischief the evidence leader going to loose his patience
jwarha21,"Nhleko is lecturing DCJ Zondo about law
Godfrey Mama,Usile @Mandy the guy is stubborn and wasting commission times. Remember Nkandla report was challenged by Adv Madonsela and dismiss by Concourt Lecturing an Adv neh this ? Publicly shows his incompetency
PETER STAFFEN,it only works his way
THABE PHALANE,prima facie
Khathutshelo Matlou,Acting clever to the wrong person. How do you lecture DCJ Zondo on what a report is? No wonder ANC meeting go on for hours and they don't agree to anything fruitful. They talk about irrelevant things. "@The Hidden Realms we don't pay tax Zondo is avoiding this guys long answers.
Mandy Phillips,arrogance won't affect Adv Hulley nhleko going to waffle to get out of answering as per norm....sad @quest....guess you'd have done a better job:-) May Zondo be granted the WISDOM to make the right decision after this finishes.
Samuel Skosana,What is this minister's Educational background?? he certainly could not have passed English logic! Why is Zondo helping this guy??
Masala Tshamano,I must Say Adv Hulley is doing exceptionally well here...
Abraham Plaatjies,zumas buddy
Arian Bester,He coughs like zuma. I don't trust him he got him
Barbara Sattler,we want facts
Kevin,Best this guy just shurrrrup...he is digging his hole and may pop up in China. "First truth he said ""i am not an expert in this""" The ANC must be so embarrassed with this guy...but do they actually care ? Hahahaha.....Hulley just showed them a finger now for talking to much. All parties are African lead because all of us are Africans.... You can only claim to be an African if you were born in Africa....Those loyal to their countries of origin are not Africans... I thought Hulley was superb...he was just interrupted all the time. @MIKE DURBAN ...but Mike the more I see how capitalism is failing the world over the more I am wondering about socialist scenarios...It doesw work in very limited examples 😉 Probably ....@MIKE DURBAN @Andre van Schalkwyk ..... no truer words spoken today....thats why my heart aches. @Dominic Przybylski ......so true. I am the nicest person you will ever know but I am a criminal. All because I smoke and love my beer 😂 My pocket is holey Hubert you read to many conspiracy theories and social media...😂 Then what about that poor little dude in the Amazon rain forest that knows nothing of the bible and the Lord ? What is his fate ? @TheTruthShall SetYouFree .......Then what about that poor little dude in the Amazon rain forest that knows nothing of the bible and the Lord ? What is his fate ?
Mfundo,oh his a traffic director now lol his too opinionated There is an old man with a bald head who is just working to sanitize the mic lol ayi
Mbuso Ndlovu,@Godfrey Mama True Zondo used to play dices with Zuma during their youth days. "@R hunter I lost them This bustaad must leave the commission now what a wasted day This witness is useless. You can't get anything from him. They must bring Bheki Cele instead😂😂😂😂 I miss Hlaudi😁😁😁 @Dominic Przybylski Yes also noticed that @Thomas Cleghorn 😁😁😁😁😁
Kevin Simon,Slam dunk!
ziggi chanza,Eish mara ANC. Look and listen to leaders that are given Ministerial position. No idea at all. Its really a shame. Cry my beloved country
Derek Govender,Democracy for the ANC was all about stealing ...sad but true!!!
Eugene Ndaba,"DCJ seem to be answering for Nhleko especially when the evidence leader probe him
Martine Engelbrecht,playing for time. bla boa bla This was a MINISTER 😂😂😂😂 playing two parts. dumb and dumber MR Zondo go give the poor guy a hug😚 Feel sorry for the people who cannot see through the lies!!!
Roy Kisten,so far he hasn't this guy doesn't need a lawyer there we again about goats first time I saw Ali got no power this guy will go Scot free
Singi Mathebula,Batohi must take this fool to court 🙄 wasted three days. what is right then? he want him to repeat the question to allow him to think of an answer. there you go😂😂 he said nothing😂😂 you missed nothing @thomas this arrogant guy wasted time.
Mongezi Mati,He is hanging himself😂😂😂
Higher Realms,Wasting Tax Payers Money We Will Stop Paying Taxes immediately Liars Thieves murderers arrest them all and Seize the Assets Correct they take the tax for sure after we've paid it
Thabang Mohale,the most boring testimony
Antoinette Meyer,what was the occurance yessssss samuel i also wonders think think my understanding EVERYONE is WRONG there you are uncleRay should insist in respect "uncle Ray wonders what Lea and Kate would have reached with this witness "we beggex uncle to stop interrupting never!!! he would be out on his ear i stillll have silence see you all 2morrow sometime
Mohamed Mia,Time waster This guy acts dumb Wipe your tears Dcj also waffles too much Ya ex minister blame every one Yes same fire pool clown
Leon Mbangwa,Can't believe that so much time is being wasted to protect wrong doing. Why would someone who was not involved in investigation have interest in changing a report Evidence leader is the one wasting time McBride was employed three or more years after the crime had been committed. He surely had nothing to do with the investigation. He should have stayed away and allow legal processes to unroll Former Minister Nhleko is on top of this and this shall end badly for the new Director of Foreign Intelligence. Minister has the oversight responsibility of the Portfolio he manages. May speak to anyone anytime within that Portfolio. Why is time being wasted The witness knows his staff. Sorry if you don't like him.
pule tsotetsi,and then Zondo keng ka yena? haibo this lawyer
Saki Louw,Precisely Sam Why is the judge putting words in the mouth of the witness? He should let the witness answer the question and allow him to contradict himself if he is not telling the truth. How many more of Ministers of Police are going to be guilty of misconduct. It's shameful. Answer the question. Agreed Thembelani
Tommygun,"They are so polite "Nhleko is like some cricketer standing at his crease and just defending and stoping each ball ...in a very long dull test match "Its not all Hulley Me too re simple answers.. "Talking about situations and consequences that arose from the trumped up charges. Disjuncture A real Devils Advocate... Is all this todo about those excisions from the 2 reports? All charges and might of the law directed to that? or differences.... "I presume all watching this and hearing his answers know in their hearts that Nhleko is lying ANyone here think Nhleko is being scapegoated and is inocent of all (or most) wrongdoing @TheTruthShall SetYouFree sounds a bit patronizing...mistakes were made all round...
i&i African Proud Son Of The Soil,wooow Anc & ZanuPF will always look like two twin Bros #Arrogant revolutionary parties a joke esp in SADC How on earth are we having such clueless barbarians as leaders
Sebastian MoAfrika,Harley came with an agenda the authority he has because he is a minister is Harley really a lawyer Harley is wasting time on non-important issues. @Leon Lebangwa I agree Leon Mbangwa you're right Hulley is feeling it's record. Hulley lies "it's record that Hulley said shame Hulley..... smh "shem Hulley is being castrated the real state capturers are being exposed. advocate mkhari black excellence mkhari is exposing Hulley's agenda but it's not Nhleko's fault that the IPID Act was unconstitutional he acted within the law and it was later found the law is unlawful hence parliament to amend the legislation accordingly Apartheid was morally wrong and legal domestically bcos of legislation hence many never saw the inside of jail. it was the democratic government that dealt with apartheid perpetrators @Redeemed :goodvibes: it was Nxesi anyone with proof of state capture? .... I mean the real state capture? Advocate Mkhari the problem with evidence leaders is that they're trying to proof preconceived notions "Hulley
Chef Brown,this is the minister who brought us the fire poooool remember
Bruce Thackwell,Oh yes even when you are guilty you are not guilty.... what a low life Three ringed circus
Rulani Maluleke,let's agree that we disagree
Tsepang R,this commission is just a huge farce... the likes of adv maleka have quit this farce. .
Nkosikhona Ginya,is this cross eximanition?
Anthony Ramasike,i bet u he wouldnt have had this attitude to Ms Hofmeyer that tiny voice becomes a sting with substance i cant agree with u more
Quest,what a stupid question Hulley uyozela ngok @Mandy Phillips I'm too busy love lol hulley uyabheda
ntsako Happy Baloyi,The former minister is Guilty based on how he answers the question
reggi,ewe ebezokwenza umsebenzi omhle. bajonge bazayobuza ndithini oonontombi ofedile matla Hulley
Lydia Nomthandazo Tshabangu,Giv him 2 adv.Maleka den yul c🤔 Paul Pretorious must bif up his team asap 😟 Nhleko wil go with his tail up..am not hepi with carnt comishin legal team..sori😕 Ooooo..no.Notshe..realy..aikona..aaiman yerrrrrr🙈🙈
dennis oldude,they didn't back you either did they? Minister of ducking and diving par excellence if you take all the time - no one can get an answer - now your are usurping the power of the concourt now the paid mouth piece will try to whitewash this man and take as long as he chooses - while he wanted this ended to meet his other commitments? so short and sweet when the questions try to prove tat you are right. When it suits you you quote extensively from the law and the validity of the rulings? lets waste more time and avoid anything of consequence? Please send him home without wasting more time Seems that suddenly we are not in any hurry. Parliament must now act against a sitting minister - in what circus will this happen - not in cloud cuckoo land no just picking up on the letter of the law while he was protecting his appointer - the right honorable and honest President Zuma No wonder he can't find a job - taking responsibility is not in his DNA - he just wants authority to spend other peoples money while he alludes to all sorts of imaginary enemies ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ - boring repetition ZZZZZZZZ We should be running a trial and putting these idiot in jail - the truth should then set them free - when they find out what the 'truth' means who mishandled the whole issue if it wasn't you? Thomas Cleghorn = just like Arbeid Macht Frei but some people admit their mistakes - have you seen any remorse here even the commission formulation and activities are wrong in the eye of this weetness And our government are master of obfuscation =- and they will keep the majority voters in poverty and slavery all for the cost of a food parcel and a T shirt Now please let Kate handle of the miscreants
Thembelani Ndlazi,So does this mean McBride used a technicality to evade accountability? I just don't know how Hulley was appointed here. This evidence leaders is hopelessly weak. Yhuuuu
Wilson Hishono,@Thembelani Ndlazi indeed and he is constatly trying to prove him wrong and almost not informed on processes
Rani Gupta,hi
kaapstad18,Who is the questioner and who does he represent? Thanks Luvuyo
Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,"Advocate Mkhari Judges don't easily intervene in re-examination. Molo @funicanz unjani? Nhleko reported on the firepool report No one has a right to tell us how to vote. There is more than one party that is African-led. The DA was African-led in the last elections. The EFF is African-led So it does not make sense to say that black people vote for the ANC only because it is African-led. So the CEO has finished
mandisi ntauzana,"@Redeemar you are lying
SBOLA A.E,Y is Zondo not interjecting
Earnest Munyoro,why should Zondo interject you should not because you have acted according to the law but the law was drafted wrongly and unconstitutional and that's not you fault the the role of the superior court to guide people into the correct interpretation there is no better alternative they can trust
David Mageva Makhuvele,Mkhari poking holes on Hulley
funicanz,"@Luvuyo Zantsi  "@Luvuyo Zantsi  He refuses to answer this report question. "Great
Siyabulela Gaju,Mr Zondo needs Wisdom and guidance from the lord🙌
Inspiration Afri,you shouldn't feel embarrassed when the court says you've acted unlawfully!!!
HALO,We need these politicians to be put in their place but too many south africans are brainwashed to support corrupted politicians There are criminals in parliament and you anc supporters are responsible for that HYPOCRISY!!!! The entire anc needs to be dismantled. Anc is nothing but a scam to make people remember 1994 and Mandela and the end of apartheid. Biggest mistake was giving africans full charge of government when they clearly were not ready. They needed more time to learn how to manage a country and develop morales You brainwashed people can't see that ANC is so corrupted. Even after the stories of anc corruption were made public people still bloody vote for them. "Yourll think Mandela was a saint. He was a bloody poster boy. And yes "The fact is that African people vote for anc because they are and Africa party. That's what I have a problem with. They don't care about corruption an African party* The rabbit hole hoes deep. Some can't handle the real situation we are in goes deep* "Some people don't even realise there's a war on your mind "The london crooks are the Rothschild family. They own the reserves banks all over the world. Only Iran Yeh our real enemies are spiritual beings If you don't believe we have spiritual enemies then you are in for a shock when it does get revealed Well times are changing. I hope you all see through the lies and corruption We are all one big cosmic family. "Oh my goodness. Please if you don't know the truth then dont make assumptions. The savior "Obviously Jesus would have been like what the people in his place of birth would of been like. He wouldn't have been caucasian "What language did Jesus speak? Ancient hebrew. Jesus wasn't a Jew Living in accordance to The Lord's will. "Identifying to a particular religion causes division. Christianity Focus on repentance and pray to the Lord. When you receive the holy spirit then you will know how to live. It will be revealed within you. "The Lord is holy Dominic you lack understanding and you are making assumptions. You are not sure of yourself "Dominic you don't keep your involuntary body functions active You cannot stand on your own boy "@Kevin "Even politicians are being led astray "Dominic😆 Buddhism was about keeping yourself pure Unless they are shown mercy and grace Hubert dont be that one proud African person. Even the Europeans were deceived so please understand their situation And Dominic I tell you that Jesus was an enlightened man What? Seeking your own truth. There is only one truth... """Speculation"" . If you actually read the different scriptures and read the HOLY teachings you will realise it's all the same. There is only ONE TRUTH DUUUUUUDE! Wake up" "The holy teachings of Buddhism "And we have ONE LORD
