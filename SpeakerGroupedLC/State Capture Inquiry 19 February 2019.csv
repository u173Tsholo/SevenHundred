CD scratches😩 Europeans must go home So that they'd stop worrying about South Africa a sangoma exists and Jesus is a fiction "Funny enough "Europe would slide back to the dark ages if we can control our resources 🐷🐖 Maria Ramos has admitted that they at Absa were manipulating the rand while it was all blamed on Zuma Regime change dirty tactics and our own clever black people alwaya fall for it. They only realize that they can't live without us as we do all the work for them and still call us lazy "White women loves black men. They pretend they don't in front of their families "John James "They're genetically weak The media is not captured by anyone. Captured from who? They own it. "At least ""looks like"" and wena you were made from a pig🐖🐷" pale piggish skin🤢🤮

GOOD AFRICA TV,heita mngomezulu Catherine oooh my word...this guy disturbed her while she was explaining about the impact of rand to dollar based on 2015 but no she has jumped 🙄🙄🙄 she's South African I think Zuma would be a last person to appear before the State capture....

Talloolah Moon,She “speaks” she doesn’t tork Yes Cassius. Worked for. Not given Myka is a race baiter Myka is fishing 🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣🎣 Feeding yourself myka Jhay my thoughts too Yose you too 🎣🎣🌻🎣🌻🌻 Karabo...keep smiling 🎣🎣🎣
Wildthing,Maybe th at Place called Cape Town investors new why the change was made. Nuclear deal with Russia. Sandile only if the country is producing enough to export. Cebo where is the evidence. or was that from the Gupta propaganda Anne and working with Guptas and they Banked and moved money with Standard chartered too Zonda is asking fare questions because it is what Zuma used it as his defences. now Zonda is getting a business answer. Cebo one question would be did that bank know what was going to happen. or did Gupta's know and inform them to trade in there favour. Cebo they came to SA with 1 Million in 1993. And in 2016 bought a mansion in Dubai worth $46 million and can't show where all the money comes from. And bought many places in India. Cebo the difference is you can go on Bloomberg and other finance sites and see what they doing and where the money is going. but I will not continue with you if you want to make it a black and white thing. listen to logic and an educated person explain it. Cebo I agree it would have an impact but the bug reason was the shuffle and uncertainty cause by Zuma Cebo. the same goes for peopple who don't want to see what really happened. so much evediance. agree cheers all
MY DNA CHOICES.,let's celebrate her brilliant mind! Who cares?
janaalt morren,@Indoda if you would practice what youhave "on you profile and really understand silence
Nelson Musoliwa,Zuma could not appreciate what this lady is explaining here as it has got to do much with numbers(economy) he thinks only ugly politics Chair is asking skewed question forgetting that there is reason behind any action markets read motives behind governance shift. Even perceptions are to be managed politics and economy works hand in hand politicians also can be alarmed by markets operations as well Cant zondo read why Nene was fired and van rooyen hired he must know that markets are keen followers of both politics and economy to protect their businesses If government change is well and reasonably explained to the markets(investors) there ant be any economic mayhem as it occurred in Nenegate Unstable political situation raise uncertainty on markets drivers so they usually reduce their economic operations in such country; simply put no one will invest with unstable countries Political instability is a cause for concern for markets role players throughout the world in this global economic jungle. To avoid policy uncertainty can only be done by a clean and transparent governance as it can have a dire consequences but it can not be absolute but can be managed as well
Lesego Modise,lolo
watson mutanga,What’s the importance of her nationality? She is not in South Africa illegally.
MANOGRIN GENGAN,"Gosh some of you are so racist
Anne M.,@Thando Nkutha You've hit the nail on the head "@Nelson Musoliwa Yes @Michael Wild Standard Chartered has admitted guilt to currency manipulation @Michael Wild Although the dismissal of Mr Nene was an impact on its own @Michael Wild The Guptas fingerprints are all over the Nene dismissal @Felix Muyoba You can block a troll by clicking on the name and click on the 3 dots on the right. @goolamv Me too. Did you see the reception he got when he arrived at parliament for SONA?
Mzalwane Mzala,he is asking a question Sometimes perceptions have nothing to do with righ or wrong. I like that. No one is irreplaceable. @grant wilkinson She also knows how to communicate her knowledge in a way that is understandable. There are smart people who fail get others to understand what is in their smart minds.
Jhay,What if we wake up one day and find out Raymond Zondo is implicated in State Capture.
Norman Zwane,@Jhay Then we all go back to sleep to wake up when Zuma is arrested "@Funani Manzi Some say he sold out to the boers before "@Yose Human HYou getting your nickers in a twist @Melvict Melbourne What do you know about Zulus? @goolamv I doubt if Ramos is not replaceable? When do the young ones get a chance if we keep redeploying the elderly? @goolamv I support you: we cannot lose that experience but can she not go on the lecture circuit and train the next generation "@Mzalwane Mzala I suspect we must replace but recycling is best. I bet we could learn more from Mbeki (both of them) "@Melvict Melbourne Actually that is an android plant you trying to address @Ibo Thabo Bcoz common sense aint that common @Thando Nkutha It was wasted breath talking into the echo chamber Zuma was @Melvict Melbourne He loved the biscuits the economists serve during the briefing however @Sofia Sofia The real gamblers banked on Bossassa not Powerball. "@Sfiso Emmanuel Mabizela Soon @grant wilkinson Their brilliance was outflanked by compromising their controllers. Big lesson going forward. Employ the geniuses but give them vent to be heard to harvest their genius @grant wilkinson Our geniuses are so fragile. Immagine if Cyril could unleash them and protect them @Val Speirs I guess Aunty Pat and tweeter Helen can make you swallow those words @Cebo Khumalo Vytjie was publicly trying to be a writer for Isidingo The Need
Sebation Nantsika,Wat are we owing Gupta that forced former president to sell the country? We now have teachers becoming politicians that’s everyone wants to take our country because we dnt have thinkers. We need to think about getting rid of this old age parliament members including malema and then run the country And again local foreign tuckshop where are they taking the money to? Malema is not helping the guy was president of the Ancyl bragging about drinking Heineken so what makes you think he changed? "On the other hand white people are playing the important part in your life remember we still have domestic workers  Dnt forget where you coming from Zulu people accept change for once
Sandile Mkhonto,"Evidence from Treasury guys is biased
karabo ramusi,lol white people like to smile for no reason @Melvict melbourne can you please take me to the future too...
Cebo Khumalo,But evidence has been revealed that international investors were manipulating currency; how much of this evidence factors the nene Gates🤷🏽‍♂️ "Michael Thank you Zondo!! Investors also capture the system I really am trying to understand this market confidence thing. How much of the banks manipulation (which banks have admitted to doing) is factored on the value of the Rand? "Michael Wild "I am simply asking Michael so did the Oppenheimers/ your Rupert’s and many more!! "The point isn’t that they arrived here also "Let’s have a fair argument Michael; I simply asked Akahambe siRight ngaye "Lols.. Michael lets carry on tomorrow!! I will engage you on that haha... I am neither a Zuma fan
Melvict Melbourne,"@karabo ramusi it is because we live for the future greed vs risk Economics are clearly not the judge's strong point Zulu's are pretty useless. They need a guy that dress himself in leopard skins to tell them what to do. "@karabo ramusi I can't @Mzalwane Mzala VERY TRUE @Myka'Al Daud so what is your pont? @Yose Human can you please stop with this Zulu crap. @Yose Human you are like a stuck record @Myka'Al Daud nobody can get to 400 years in todays world. Handouts is not the way to go. @Yose Human are you he result of Limpompo education? "Showerhead couldn't even count properly @Sofia Sofia because the cadres were all on the take @AFRICA AZANIA you only buy things that has value @Ibo Thabo because grants have to be paid @Eugene Ntela Economics on garden boy Van Rooyen appointment @Ibo Thabo Value is determined by the person willing to buy it @Cebo Khumalo SA gov can't determine the value of the rand. Free market dictate the value..what are others willing to pay "@Willie Makena don't blame the leaders @Fils de l'homme Hi mate yes Watson is a cadre @Ibo Thabo FIAT money...only thing that give all currencies value is the 'promise' that the issuing government will honor it @Ibo Thabo when the gold standard were still in place the currency were supported by gold When will the ANC voters get on their knees and ask for forgiveness? @Neo Mongale always someone else...can't you take responsibility for your actions. @Ibo Thabo because we are conned. @Neo Mongale I ask for forgiveness that my forefathers extended your life expectancy and that we gave you a first world country to destroy @Ibo Thabo in 1971 the gold standard were abolished. @Ibo Thabo so gov can print money without having value behind it. If yu print more that you should you become Zim or Venezuela @Ibo Thabo SA minerals can be found elsewhere @Ibo Thabo The world over prints fake money. Not one country's currency is backed by minerals @Funani Manzi vote for Jimmy Home
Zanele Lukhele,👋🏾
Eslon Eslon,Biggest mistake the ANC made was to make Zuma the president. otherwise we wouldn't be here with all these rumblings. The damage he caused the country is massive and now? figures are throwing lawyers around I wonder if the commission has economists to help them understand numbers and figures?
Radikadi Rashilo,ABSA made a statement that they collaborated with others to manipulate the rand exchange value... now why are we at this again?💁💁💁

Why do SA Gov have to live on borrowing FAKE DOLLARS (Nixon shock 1971) instead of keeping our intrinsic minerals (gold & diamonds) value them here and print the worthy as money to stimulate us? "@malvict Melbourne You mean if we keep our intrinsic minerals Economically intrinsic mineral mainly gold & diamonds authorise the print of money not the other way around so why we are depending the American fake dollar? @ Melvict Melbourne What the “others willing to pay”? Where do those others get their money to pay? @Melvict Melbourne Doesn’t we needs a guarantee for a note or coin & that guarantee can only be an intrinsic item otherwise the notes or coin is fake? @Melvict Melbourne Why do anyone in the right mind do accept notes that just printed by someone without any control + guarantee? @melvict Melbourne what does that mean because we are connected? I am asking your specific Q so stop talking nonsense Does SA in general the ANC NEC in particular is forced or just willingly keep S Africans poorer while stimulating intrinsic minerals to the world?
