carnoth ngomane,This commission presents golden opportunity to CR to uproot corruption and restore the already tarnished image of the ANC
P V,this guy just knows money. and he is sooo calm "corruption is a virus..""Samora Machel """ what is he saying exactly
welton paulse,this guy seems to be more factual "I simply admire ADV Maleka "Whatever starts as an infection if not treated immediately "Cell phone problem is that ANC wont go after parliamentarians only after people outside government look at Agrizzi i would say arrest parliamentarians first and send a stern warning to the rest and the world. @ying yang very much so "@Sofia Sofia  Oh here Maleka is going to nail him
Derek Main,@Yin Yang Transnet is too much of a mess - that will cause load-shedding for sure @Robert Russell Don't forget about the cell companies - their capture of the state also needs investigating Seems like nothing has changed in the ANC - still protecting the corrupt criminals in their ranks. They deserve to be punished at the polls
Robert Russell,CR says he will only act on a report from the commission on cabinet members...the commission needs to wrap up ESKOM and issue a report.... otherwise nothing will happen as the it will go on for ever "The move onto ...Transnet this commission will be busy for years and years if they don't issue reports ASAAP and not at the end agreed Welton Yip.... who wants to take a chance of naming all the implicated ministers... ?????? in hind sight you are 100% right.... No More zoll for you King.... Is King a badly programmed BOT by any chance 😃 😃 😃 @Frik Brits ROFLMAO @Thando Nkutha .... and the EFF goes to VBS to rob the poor Ok I'll include the ANC as well
roberto wilco,Soon as the government get hold of the reserve bank it will be game over 100 rand to the us/dollar Exactly Literally gonna run out of money and then they will have to print more money zimbabwe/venezuala style Exactly "It is scary  No politician can save South Africa if they were a business they would be trading while insolvent Yes Sofia

Lucky123 Thwala,insangu ganja well planned corruption
Sebation Nantsika,MyANC @choma o maka
Indoda Yamaqiniso,1983 contracts i.e 40 years EVERGREEN contracts which to this date stipulates where black people should stay inside Eskom's and mines' facilities. Beautiful!! It's even more interestingly beautiful that the evidence leader decided to let that lose.
Sofia Sofia,Hi All ❤ "I was just thinking this capture is so pointless tariffs are being increased anyway @welton paulse - so you with me this is all pointless ? Petrol increase ! Eskom Increase ! Food Increase ... and these IDIOTS are still testifying ! and will be doing so till the cows come home !!!!!! Elections are just a way of choosing a different method to kill us !
digitalemotionfilms,I see all the special class kids are here on the forum again
Henry Sunguro,v
Makwa Choma,IF PEOPLE VOTE ANC N IT WINS WITH MAJORITY OUR COUNTRY IS DEAD
John-Basel Ioannou,who is this guy "they're getting to the penalties for Glencore "Glencore was forced to sell there's quite a difference between R700million and R2.1billion.Mafia to push out a legit company debts get taken over no Thando the owner is liable correct Anne
rohan barnard,And who is this guy and what did I miss this week? I was out of country. I really have a lot to catch up on hahahaha Will take the weekend to recap on everything that happened. @Yin Yang cause SA is still my home even though there is a lot going on. 😄 @Yin Yang all countries have their own issues to deal with. SA is just worse off LOL The USA has a pumpkin of a racist president. who turns out is also corrupt North Korea has a child as a dictator.... Venezuela is screwed. @Yin Yang thank you so much. Glad to be back! I missed the heat and sunshine 😂😂 "@Yin Yang exactly! Can't say I missed the crime though. Geezz
Anne M.,@rohan barnard On Tuesday we heard how the pre-payment bypassed the regulations at Eskom. "Gert Opperman @Frik Brits Cancelling the contract would be what an honest business would do. We know that some senior managers were dishonest. @Frik Brits Plus there was the matter of the huge pre-payment "@Frik Brits The Portfolio Committee in parliament is supposed to provide oversight. And we've heard how they were lied to or were themselves ""bought""." "@Thando Nkutha Yes "@Thando Nkutha When businesses are sold

M T,#Frik Brits Managers vs Damagers 😏 "The Whole lot belong behind bars! Squirrel included - Ignorance is no excuse "#Johnny Cash - This repetitive BS - in your lifetime - Do you stutter as badly #Johnny Cash I guess you’re between 20 & 35yrs! Makes sense 😏 Frik certainly didn’t condone this behaviour! BTW! #Chris Welensky. 🎯 On point! Catch Call!!! Never in your lifetime will it be “A person HUNG” - “Hanged ... Yes”! 😬 #Frik A waste of breath - It’s the era of “Free Everything”. Red ‘n nasie met so ‘n volk? (Change the spelling of volk maar) 🎯 🎯
