Desmond Masilela,Its now 14:05 I see all advocates are back @Thando Nkutha I was just about to say that. I had blocked that guy early in the morning. Im surprised to see people keep on entertaining Fils @Thando Nkutha. Thank you Thando hope I wont see that name flies in this chart @Thando Nkutha. Its a pity because you see his name people keep on entertaining him. Brian Molefe must come and testify.
fuzile dazana,i like thiis maleka guy and fuzile by they my name is fuzile fuzile doent mince his word true witness nt that mentor lady who is confused you can tell this is not a lair hendre you listen with a skin not with ears mr nene also was in this thulani this man is listening with skin nt with ears
Dumile Mateza,The 8th of December seems to be the day Nene was fired? These guys were doing a Iqbal Surve regarding this nuclear deal. Calculating the nuclear price from R10. I meant R10 exchange rate to the dollar The real lesson the Commission is teaching us and I think the youth should listen is how not to run a government "@Bongani Maqabuka we are there as Eskom is buckling under a R450b debt @Derek Govender are you saying MYANC must be arrested? I am no economist nor an expert on currencies but the pula will remain weak to the dollar because it is tagged to the rand and the pula is not traded internationally. @Jones Parker Botswana is part of the Southern African Customs Union and because the pula despite being tagged to the rand. It is not a internationally traded currency as a result it is not affected by the violatility the rand is subjected to. @Domonic Przybylski i hope you are not saying that because the majority of them in cabinet are black I Like the term battalions
Chris Bard,"Heppy
Thulani Bukani,Yes @Chris Bard free access to state resources for ANC comrades. Yes. Mentor was all over the place. Are you even listening @Handre? He does what they always do when black people talk. "Because this man is being open and critical of the ex president. You say he’s covering up for the ex president. So which means you’re not listening. And as a black person Yes @Fuzile. I agree bro. @john-Basel is askining is nonsense. Fils is one of Bell Pottingers fake news bots.
Eslon Eslon,Fuzile is well composed and elaborative The discussion is becoming academic now Maleka knows his job I'm enjoying both the evidence leader and the witness. Their level of intelligence is pretty impressive This one was too clever to be corrupted and captured This guy is honest and frank I like that Battalions of experts. Atleast I learn a new word today This guy must be given the reserve bank job if the current governor step down "@Zanele Whoever has to cross examine Fuzile had to be really super sharp Skeletons board is another term "@News update "@Felix Muyoba Ann 7 pro-zuma propaganda TV channel "@Indoda ANC is in court fighting Supra "@Thando
Hendré Harris,whatever! covering for ZUMA hahahaha pffff hahahaha why do u always have to bring race into everything...very mature dude rofl

Ntombethemba Manase,"No "van rooyen It wont be easy at all to cross examine this gentleman. He is on his own league. The cross examiner will be frustrated.

Orbert Mulaudzi,Ethical people who were leading critical institutions were made to quit....this guy Lungile Fuzile must come back
Bongani Maqabuka,@Dumile Mateza craziest; this is street econmics gone way out wrong! We r no where nearer to that even now... @Dumile Mateza I can't agree with U more! "😂😂😂poor Zuma A batallion of experts!😂😂😁😁
Wildthing,That's misleading it should not happen very serious. And misleading. And would lead to many dominoes effect. how could the Rand strength with Zuma in charge at the time. in 1970 it was about R1 = $3 but those days are gone long time ago. big question was why they going to Russia and not local. No trust in local work force. Felix just stating Dumile nit in 1970.SA was independent but not free for all. I like Maleka Zuma telling Mps how to do there work like a dictator was Brown not She Thanks Need stricked jail terms for people in the top. And a separate department to manage that. And government should not have the power to change them. like removing the scorpions. Yes who was the compliance officer in Goverment Sangoma Dudu you joking Sofia so Sofia you support slavery. just Google the people that build the buildings so read up t And second point Sofia 70% of the engineers are from SA. also the architects. they had to leave due to AA sorry did not mean to. rather discuss it. agree Why does Zonda not already ask for action to be taken on people that have enough evediance against them. we need the ball rolling. Ha ha true
Phillip Moshapo,Viva MI16 party Sindiswa Moolman MI6 party
Sindiswa Moolman,What is MI16 Party @Phillip Moshapo ? "Yes @Phillip Moshapo "Thats why when dealing with a currency like ours "Listening to the NPA inquiry @Derek Govender You are risk averse @Thando Nkutha I dont blame you @Thando Nkutha Two years ago i bout $700 for R9659. Brown in National Treasury @Michael Wild not the former minister Molefe still believes nuclear is the best option

Felix Muyoba,@Eslon Eslon we are dealing with technical stuff now.. @Michael Wild 1970? no matter how stable the african country can be its currency will always below the dollar/pound..jrrrrrrrr what is this? @nhlanhla nkosi why are you wasting your time that day dreamer..if you want transvaal go to europe and go create your transvaal there..never again will you hear about transvaal..just keep dreaming.. @Eslon Eslon he is not being cross examined..they are just confirming his readiness for cross examination.. @Fils de l'homme wena you are from where? @Fils de l'homme where is that? @Eslon Eslon not at all..he is too bright not like our poor sister (mentor)
William Pieters,in the 1960's the Rand Pound was the same. please educate this man. Respect and goodluck @Fils de l'homme springbok will suit him better.
Andre Gerber,in mid 80's i got $2 for R1.
MIKE DURBAN,Great Stuff....this state attorney is too sharp... @DEREK....spot on @Eslon...spot on Come on now...they wanted the Nuclear deal at all costs.......ie. Dollars in their pockets. Think about it. They knew full well what they were doing...... If you don't speculate....you don't accumulate... Maybe R20...after elaections...let's see.... @Thando...never play with your bread money.. Play with money you can afford to loose etc... @Thando...spot on Let's say I speculate a little.. @Thando...spot on.

"I""m proudly SA Bra's..." ALL of us should be proudly SA........Everyone.. @Indoda........You've been brainwashed by the Gov Bra... Eeeeeesh....some are still playing the race card......obsessed with it hey... @Moira....they can't think of anything else I'm afraid...totally brainwashed...

Puseletso Loape,@Derek i agree Mr President will you please return vat to 14%🤔🤔 @John_
dave newman,so the guy says nothing about Maria's collusion on the Rand
Anthony Ramasike,the evidence that need to be interrogated Sir sure Mr Govender its agreed but not to the fullest for now
michael mbatha,"Exactly @Thando Nkutha - It doesn't matter that you can buy instruments to protect yourself from Rand/Dollar volatility "At the time """..the job of the finance minister is to find the money.."" JZ"

Keegan Goddard,Pula is not pinned to the rand "1 usd = 10 1usd = R14
Dominic Przybylski,South Africa is a democratic kleptocracy. Is okay to lose your own money but if you lose somebody else's money that is normally treated as theft. Unfortunately we are force to give our money via tax to these people in cabinet who have no qualifications and know nothing about what they are doing. I have no faith in any politicians. They are politicians because they cannot do anything else. He was a lawyer. Probably cannot even fix a leaking tap in his home. We need a form of government where we don't need politicians. They are the most useless people in society. It's coming. People don't understand what is going to happen with 4th Industrial Revolution. We will be governed better by robots. If they break a promise we can send them back to the factory and ask for a refund. Never say never. The best thing about robots is they don't need to get laid or feel the need to eat caviar and drink champagne. Politician's job is easiest white-collar job to automate. We expect to much from politics. Our politicians get their support from people who cannot look after themselves and who think somebody else will do it for them. "Some people believe in witchcraft Thing that confuses me is which country Ramaphosa was deputy president before he became this country's president. The real legacy of apartheid is a lack of self-esteem amongst so many people. If you don't believe in yourself the it's easy for corrupt politicians to make you believe in them. Education and indoctrination are very similar. If people don't believe they are worth anything then they abdicate control of their lives and decisions to others. "We each have to take responsibility for our own lives People who have already testified are a lot safer than those who have not. @Indoda Yamaqiniso Africa is my home. Deal with it. @Indoda Yamaqiniso about to be blocked. People playing race card are simply a waste of space. I block all of them. "@Sofia Sofia It won't be recovered. It's lost @John-Basel Ioannou Everybody pays tax. Most people do everything they can to avoid paying tax because we now see where it all goes. At moment tax is just a donation to our rulers for them to play with as they like. "That's after fuel levy "@Sofia Sofia They take and take

ronelle van zyl,"""whatucallthisthingnow...."" legal opinion."
Nelson Musoliwa,The haste that zuma was driving this nuclear deal indicated total disregard by the powers of the future of this country as compared to their own benefits. As SAns we dismally failed to demonstrate skills and capability to manage politics and governance when we are in power.Periods Anybody' s decision must be communicated not transferred to somebody else as many leaders tend to exercise their power. Africans can manage the continent without whites but much better with whites as we can not wish them away. The earth belongs to all human kind. IIndoda we must strip them of this arrogance and practically teach them umbutu by our actions towards life itself
