Kevin Simon,Does RET change WNC into BMC. Sure seems that way from what I've seen and heard in this Commission. This is racist procurement practices at work. Thinly disguised theft from SOEs. Just never thought it would become an annuity income for an elite Black minority. "This witness chose her outfit carefully in order to elicit a cultural connection in this colonial style
Waterbearer,Gorgeous outfit Wow! I don’t do fashion policing. Each to his or her own
Gabisile Mabuza,beautiful as the outfit may be however it is not suitable for the witness's arms she is a clever fool go for her DCJ the reason you are confused is because you put yourself in a trap there come the stories again its because she is a witch that mischievous grean annoys me but she just said she is not the advisor of the board she is such a bad liar DCJ is now stamping his authority give a reason not an example she is clearing her throat like Zuma was there? simple question she seems to be interested in convincing the public that she is not corrupt "can someone tell me what happened to the ""I mean like...like I mean""?" and she is co-opted to take the trip for that particular reason tell her DCJ she wants to take the chair through the role of the board yet she does not know her role...interesting the advice is implied in the email
Ria Sokiri,Nice outfit booom shez trying so hard to be calm 🤔 grandpa her face expression though ☺️
Eliot Chauke,Zondo is bullying Adv Memela DCJ is allowing Hofmeyer to abuse Memela @Bev Daniels which Malema🤓🤓🤓 you are so obsessed Hofmeyer is the Evidence Leader... 🤓 i would love to see Hofmeyer vs Hlaudi🤓🤓 seems like DCJ will keep on interrupting during the re-examining 👀
Karen x,oh my oh my...what a disgrace to appear at the commission dressed like it was a party "well her attitude is despicable all garages have cctv cameras.....
laura lee kruger,outfit not appropriate! Ms Mbanjwa uugh trying to run around the facts that Mamela is guilty...fact Try and get out o that one mamela Whatsapp messages cannot be forged. Would love to see how she is going to try and get out of this one😂 attempt for damage control you guys here are soo cool Go Kate...we love you """And all That"" is BS" I just hope Mamela sees all the comments to know what the public is saying about her BS here come the sick note.......she's not well????😂 taxpayer money paid for the outfits Oh judge I love you "@Rendani Netshiheni charming Mtokozisi Balen stop refering to white monopoly this is about BEE stealing from taxpayers "@Hennie Cloete  blinking eyes too much is a sign of lying "@Gabisile Mabuza  don't feel sorry for her. she's a criminal 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Gerhard Botha,eliot chauke please wake up
Person of interest,"Looks beautiful needs "I know They are playing for time. Again. "Brian it's a Everybody Calm Down break This is not how innocent people behave. Lol. Memela is not helping her cause by being stroppy. She will get a *kateklap* today "She has not read the WhatsApp? This witness is dodging and diving. She had to be dragged here Chuck her out judge Sick note on its way "Kate is not hostile Like nailing jelly to the wall "Top should be green or red "Quite right Michael We should be listening to the evidence so we can engage intellugently "Sick note coming "yes "Jacob an unwritten rule is something you make up when the judge is onto you "Judge and Ms H complement each other he's twisting the knife "Nononono "Ok "And now she says she's not nearly high enough to advise the board Elvis lol English lesson from Mbanjwe argument Taytive Who killed truth telling? "Judge could tell her in about 5 or 6 different languages Sick note coming lunchtime "Ooh "I am a very peaceful person puppets and tools "Fed up with this lawyer
Rudzani Vhudi,party😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 exactly chairperson must tell her to sit down she is wasting time. you must make rulling chair she is emotional
Meela Monyamane,I think the outfit is amazing too @Corlé Jensen
Rob Nel,"Witness is evasive @Paul Buchel the head piece looks like the the emblem for SAAF Time wasting "The black straps in front Strange how all the witnesses get sick She now goes against her own statement badge for SAAF Confused because of lies "before end of day All her answers take 10 minutes. "If Mbanjwa defended me in a serious matter Zondo is giving her 101 in being a lawyer
Paul Buchel,"@Person of interest​ "@Rob Nel "Wow "She's in the mud now "@Jacob Zuma "@Elvis Malakoane DCJ is about to break out into laughter. "She is disgusting One seriously stoned advocate.

Sometimes in corporate we have rules that are not part of policy but we follow them like religion. Why can't Adv Memela just answer simple question straight today? maybe medication is affecting her. Adv Memela is being affected by medication "I wanted to drink tea during tea time @Dominic Przybylski am not in a priviledge position of having resources to procure solar *privilege* Ms Mbanjwa must relax Eish we back to the old Adv Hoffmeyr......... She doesn't hear what the witness is testifying about. She wants to draw corruption from withdrawal of a tender and the partnership as signed. "Can someone buy me data??? telkom please Ms Mbanjwa LOL Adv Memela is rushing to answer The medication is having its effect on Adv Memela
Granny Mokwena,ms Mbanjwa sit down her answers are never for the question "yooo such a long answer to "" why would the previous tender price be publicly available""?" Kate for the kill I can't deal with her long confusing answers lies but you can't use legal info against someone she's dodging hey oh my word this woman "what nonsense! Advocate Hofmeyr is one of the best in this commission classy and professional response. undeserving of anything further "advocate Hofmeyr has a job to do her whole testimony didn't make sense so far who's desputi she wanted to make sure bee people got tender at all costs! "her answers are in codes "Listen no one has implied she the advisor of the board. "see "😂😂😂 it's not funny it's a no he didn't earn me or yes he did. conte What? contrremporeanios they killed the evidence! wow limousines! ms Hofmeyr is so energetic hey what abuse? cross examination is not abuse "even if it's against the rules

Patrick Nelson,It is becoming quite obvious why SAA is in the doldrums today. Incompetency of the SAA Management and the Board.
Gerda 7,Stop beating around the bush!! She is in hot water!!! Sick??maybe babalas?? I don't remember!! "Lady
Abdul Gafoor Dangor,Ms. Maimela. Just be honest If there was no tender which was won by JM would they still have paid the R2.5 m for her house Yes please. Switch off her mic Make the ruling. This is going nowhere

Ozzy Ozzy,I wouldnt want her to be my lawyer Please take control Mr Zondo hahaha she iis in the dark now yoooooooooh Lies will make you confused hahaha
Thami Ngwenya,"This advocate is meticulous
Pheladi Lamola,Ms Memela's lawyer is just trying to earn her hourly rate. Arguing for the sake of it. She's trying to excuse her behaviour by saying she was helping black business!! Wrong is wrong Yeah she's trying to pull at the judge's heart strings with that outfit but it's not working. Someone give her a jersey since she's sick. I don't remember what the judge's question was🙆‍♀️ I refuse to accept that this lady is an advocate. What? She's wearing Xhosa or Zulu traditional attire @Chris Welensky. She's not gonna return after lunch. It seems her condition is getting worse. Someone slip her a lozenge for now Judge becoming a teacher now. Wow She might as well have read for all of us. Thank you judge. She's been interrupting throughout the day
Andre Ackerman,"Lies
Anne M.,"Ms Mbanjwa learnt well from JZ's advocates "A bit early for you to be trolling Not tea time. DCJ needed a few minutes. @Cedric Man Yan Maybe @Maryann Diamond Doesn't look like it. "@Gareth Hellyar Ms Memela was subpoenaed to appear "@Elvis Malakoane Hmmmm Ms Mbanjwa clearly watched JZ's advocates. She's repeating almost word for word. @Diana Sekatane A 2.5 million deposit on her house @laura lee kruger She might because earlier she mentioned what the public was hearing. @Pastor J 😃 @Brian Benningfield Agree @Vikes Sejato Didn't Agrizzi also talk about Shell garage meetings? 😂 "@BeachDude420 Peters Yes "Yes @Pastor J When? "@Pastor J Oh dear. Yes "@funicanz Yup
Phillip Cwazibe,@Pheladi Lamola the evidence can not be refuted. @Phiwe Mkhuzo Ms. Memela is in a corner she can not get out off. @mandisi ntauzana ​Adv Hoffmeyr is hostile: means that questions are getting difficult. @ laura lee kruger ​here the sick note? She said she is fine at the start of the questioning. @Anne M. no one can miss Shell garages. They are bright and yellow.😂 "@Sthakathi Khumalo ​ Mntaka Malume kuthiwa "Michael Rijsmus ​ Is she cringing because the ""bribe""money came through her firm." @ mandisi ntauzana ​Its an unwritten rule.............. Ethics...common sense. @Michael Wild -Agreed. Her attire is her choice and her taste. @Gareth Hellyar.. she knew exactly what to do and that is why she manipulated the processes.
Brian,Isn't this a Zuma tactic?? My bet is on Adv Hofmeyer coming out tops Disrupt; disrupt; disrupt is the tactic. But Adv Hofmeyer will have nothing of it! Oh Oh - I am sick?? Now Z is questioning her intergrity "Hope Ms Hofmweyer picked up her ref to ""the top""?" Long rambling story - another delaying tactic? Still circumventing the price sharing question! Alonzo. Agree. Hence my statement that she doesn't strike me as being stupid. I remain confused. Is there or isn't there a rule? LOL LOL Precisely Michael! More importantlyly Z knows she is lying LOL
Jabu Malinga,when is the commission investigating capture of UGU Municipality for 1 Billion corruption ??? its now bankrupt
Saresa Myburgh,"KATE IS BOILING IN HER CHAIR. Come on Kate kate hofmeyr is A TOP ADVOCATE. gareth she is an advocate Gareth Hellyar - this mamela woman is an advpcate relax guys - this Jacob Zuma is not the ex president - this JZ can spell - ex president cannot spell nor count

Judge is tying her up in knots now. "But Mamela Judge is BRILLIANT!!!!
Thebe Phama,yes Mr Zonda
Cedric Man Yan,This is only an inquiry. The lawyer could make notes and raise them afterwards. Imagine how long this will be when Zuma appears. Toilet break? I'll be out of data by then. Lol Whose the boss here?
Gareth Hellyar,What is happening now? Early tea break? "Then Why do you need your lawyer with you if you are innocent? A very long four minutes. Got you! Love the costume. Go girl!! See got Adv. Hoffmeyers name right today. Glad Miss Mamela is not my advicate. "#advocate Glad not mine. Imagine her trying to defend someone. Think trying to distract everyone with her outfit. Hear comes Mommy again. #here. If she is sick she should cover her chest up. She now going to call it a racist attack because she threw the files at her. "Another long story Another long story. He is soooo patient. "How many BEE co get paid by government? And Understanding? Remember i said... Spot on!! Michael Rijsmus. She got a big house in Bedfordview out of this. "Are you still in Cuba Shooting fish in a barrel. "Not a bank Just what i was thinking. Seventy eleventy. Getting herself confused again. Getting out of breath . Her lawyer is as confused as she is. She dis not understand what her function was at SAAT. #did Yep JZ! You also worked to your own rules. SONA. Going to be another circus. Best entertainment on T.V. Wont miss it. "If you had to put Adv. Hoffmeyer and Adv. Mamela head to head A deer in headlights. She doesn't know what has hit her. She is under oath. Lying through her teeth. Looking at her lawyer again. Tying her up in knots. Who appointed her to her position at SAAT? "Or Her doke. It's our to eat now. @vincent kolobe #turn She doesn't know what her position was. Bye. Got ya!!
anya van loggerenberg,let me guess its tea time right? number2 break its the dodgy curry break you have a right to an attorney what the heck is she wearing ! her super women outfit 😂😂but the only super woman here is adv hoffmeyer strong arms 💪 @JS Bach well it tells me that she doesnt own a mirror they are just scared she dressed up for judge zondo 🦸‍♀️

heinie paxton,4minutes
Patrick Haingura,Adv Hofmeyer is just sharp. she is her own class!! I hardly see the two reaching consensus simply because of 'cover v/s uncover' A rulling is likely... Both the witness and her defrnce council so far have been failing to intimidate Adv Hofmeyer! The harder they try the harder it backfire eish! Mbanjwa conceded...
Reetsang Maphunye,agree Patrick
Zefa Maake,i sm just disappointed how this woman deny the truth wasting state money they shoulg go to jail. are their conseous dead . are think they have an evil agenda there is nothing you get through silver platter for free

She has Mandisa here on the chat on a watching brief....hehehehehehe Memela @Michael Wild ...hahahahahaha The other Malema is still coming with his book of lies. Lets be patient...@Michael Wild R.I.P Joseph Shabalala. Founder of Ladysmith Black Mambazo. A TRUE LEGEND. Maybe a Spaceship?Lets wait and see...@Stronger together Who killed the evidence.

Wildthing,save as much what a joke. selling something for let's say R20.00 and the company that bought it sold that item for R2000.00 let's stay on subject in the chat. shell have video recordings "The way Miss Malema speaks she should have about 5 books out on how purchasing works in all companies But my understanding. she is asking about the basic rules of doing business in the company "I hope they booked a week for the cross examination https://www.sa-tenders.co.za/content/hints-tips-and-news/acts-governing-south-african-tender-environment-pppfa in banking it's called inside trading and is a big jail time and loss of all money and assets Judge Zonda is now protecting Miss Hoffmeyer by proving her point in a well articulated question but is the same as what Miss Hoffmeyer asked. please leave her outfit out as a subject of disrespect. its nit what is on trial and is disrespectful to make comments that may lead to arguments. let's rather focus on the role she had and debate it. Sipho you will be removed. keep it clean and respectful she was head of procurement. now Judge will ask the same question in a different way. watch ha ha
