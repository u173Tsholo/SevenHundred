Nkosinathi Mdhluli,KWASUKA LOKHO
dennis oldude,why does this happen after the start - of the sitting? they know in advance that there is going to be a delay so why not sort o\it out earlier? The whole team representing the Zondo commission is a bloody joke - they can't get anything right and everyone finds another loophole - why is this allowed Mr Nair is a senior magistrate - and he is being prejudiced? If anything come out on cross examination that will be unfair? Lets delay this until 30 February please Why don't we just accept that no one did anything wrong and this is just a whitewash to waste tax payers money Mr Zondo - grow some big ones and put your foot down for a change and send someone to jail - don;t waste any more time on these clowns - you need top send someone to arrest this clowns
