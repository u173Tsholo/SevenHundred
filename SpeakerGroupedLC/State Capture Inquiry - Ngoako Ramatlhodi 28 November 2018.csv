thembeka shibe,"i agree with you counsel is nervous but let us give her a chance "from Adv Ramathlodi's evidence Zuma is not the only sell out kulungile mfanakithi zobonona emuva kwetiye😂😂 so what will happen if his former PA says she lost his diaries??? "I'm a proud Zulu BUT I refuse to be crucified for other peoples wrong doings!!! so leave the Zulus out of this "my question exactly ZONDO "Over 80 people were scared of 1 person Can Zondo let Ms Buthelezi sit down cz seriously he is not giving her a chance to do her job ok Manyi no Post Grad!! @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU according tto Ramathlodi can Zondo Please call Manyi again I would like to hear his response I'm sure Rama first thought it was a prank😀😀😀😀😀
ST James Rama,"Ramogolo Abel please be honest about everything Yah he is nailing him... When Zuma goes down a lot of prominent figures in politics are also going down. If they don't protect him they are going down Mokwena i hope that you are not endangering your life here... Mantashe is weak Adv Rams is even helping this lady because he can see that she's not asking relevant questions Rams was sacked because he didnt want to play ball with the guptas 🐍 Kulungile mfanakithi then he sacked him... Lucky Dlamini he is telling the truth Don't be afraid for Ramatlhodi he too has military training hahahahah Louis Eloff I agree with you Keryn Dankie Mokwena That tea must have been really hot What kind of tea are they drinking... 38 minutes When are they back online? So Gordhan is innocent Wilson M he eventually did resign Thank you Mokwena
Lucky Dlamini,I love listening to the struggle story. "NOT SUMMON "Kanti It is probably what Manyi was saying is poetic. Dates dololo! Dololo @sakhile mtshali Absolutely @peter pott Unfortunately his diaries are still kept by his former PA @Mpondzwana😂 I don't think Ngoako and uncle gweezy agree on these things. I think Ngoako spends too much time with grandchildren😁 I think the Judge has realised that they'd ask him for way forward. Absolutely @Andre Gerber Who said something about the Guptas and Ngoako's front teeth?😂 Zuma paralysed the NEC????Yerrrrr!
Thamsanqa Nomayela,Ngoaka s history is very rich. Ngoaka is speaking nothing but the truth. Guptas were Some Rockafellers some sort. We still need Mr Ramatlohodi in the ANC President s powers of the ANC are too much if that so but I know is the last speaker in ANC event or meeting. Zuma the true reflection of the betrayal the struggle. Tea is gonna stop the spirit of Ngoako.
Nozipho Thembeka,Father Zuma ???
Sizwe Retyu,lol Come out with all of them baba. SHOW OFF! Viva Ramothlodi! Thank you Adv Ramathlodi 🕺🕺🕺 Ramathlodi is going deeper 🙊🙊
Singi Mathebula,i am raising this because i did not observe these comments when maleka and the other male advocates lead. it just not on. the guptas took an advantage of our president. honestly!! and the witness knows what he is talking about. leave the evidence leader alone. """ my people perish because of lavk of knowlege"" so say the Lord. thus is the only reason why the guptas took charge ." "l think zondo must end the commission  very interesting. is manyi learnig something from this witness? nemulondi😀that was a figurative. was a zuma law unto himself or the guptas were? do we have data for youth and data for the old? noted mornalisa🤣 today's testimony is heart breaking. captured by foreigners all because of greediness. go deeper cd leader.
samuel molope,zuma didnt attended gupta wedding aah ngwako revealed all even chairman forgot to go for tea time tea time please my ngaoko is tired
Londani Rodney,Gedleyihlekisa was Guptas puppet Rama is exposing them tjooo🙄🙄🙄 Rama ke bosso🤗🤗🤗 @ nkosi nikiwe this man is on fire...he's saying it all "Do you think Mr Gedleyihlekisa Zuma is watching this @olga mayeza Rama deserves a bell Rama will be trending today for this evidence I'm sure Zondo is in hurry☕☕ wanting to come back for more from Rama @Buyiswa Mnyani i'm Rama is laughing now saying i will show e'm flames😂😀 Mrs Buthelezi was on leave @peter pott and he says straight from the school which means Brian had no experience by then....we are required to have experience to get jobs.... Rama is also corrupt I am sure the former Press was going to India😁😂😂
nzaliseko mbedla,His Imppression?
Sindiswa Moolman,It was clear that the Guptas were leading this country. JZ was only their proxy. He had his own soldiers and cheer leaders in that NEC @Ayanda Kleyi I agree @Lucky123 Thwala . This man now is just conversing with the chairperson. We are watching a social chat between the Chair amd Adv Ramathlodi Yes.. he was also protected by some in that NEC @Ayanda Kleyi The man is interesting @Mongezi Nkonyeni. With all this singing who wants tea? This is former minister guys and he is exposing the rot in Zumas cabinet. Even Zondo is really interested in what this witness has to say. JZ @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU He was powerful in the NEC @Thanyani Nthangeni. The Guptas were powerful in the Cabinet They were powerful in the Cabinet through their proxy...JZ @Thanyani Nthangeni me too @Ewald Kruger I think he will be hostile @Ewald Kruger. JZ planted his cheerleaders and supporters in that NEC @Ewald Kruger. more than 60% of the NEC was benefitting from that relationship. My point exactly @Michael Zulu Thats the only reasonable answer to that Q I wonder where would we be as country if that balance of power didnt change... Eishhhh... the evidence leader Please drive safely @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU. You will find us here when you come back next year. hahahaha... @ramahudu france Yaaa...@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU. I agree... @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU and give business to his friends @Theo Bhengu It looks like shes still in training @Sifiso Sinda @Doom Ruler Does it mean must come back and respond to these allegations? They should have called Manyi after this witness "Hayi @Yose Human is chatting to himself @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU  Manyi was supposed to come after Rama @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Block them @ANELE SINENHLANHLA ZWANE

Job Mokolutlo,"@Tshepo Mahlangu. It was just a fallacy propagated by ANC that JZ was a ""Politician"" before his association with the Gupta. The fact is JZ was a headache for the ANC in exile!" @dave east. Correction! Only Zuma supporters were stupid not to realize that they were being led by a deliquent! There you have it guys! JZ ministers were proud to be called Gupta deployed Ministers! @Singi Mathebula. I concur with you fully here! Zondo might as well close the inquiry because the verdict/findings are obvious! "Adv Rama has just simplified the definition of state capture!

Mkhululi Bushula,@Mornlisa Yose has been doing this nonsense since yesterday I think she is sicking attention. I am flabbergasted that a board member of the Soe can issue instruction to a minister not visa versa. @Keith Sindile Dinabantu I am disappointed with u mfanakuthi I thought u will call Yose into order remember one day there was guy who was mocking Xhosas we both took offence and reprimanded the guy. She is new in this platform she started yesterday doing this nonsense. @Hayi kakubi mhlekazi but as responsible ppl we can not pretend as if asimboni umntu ebhoxa as black ppl we under attack but look at ppl like Yose. @Keith Sindile Dinabantu I rest my case I think we should just ignore this person. It seems the judge is the evidence leader today. Is Yose a she or a he? Shame the poor evidence leader maybe she is still an intern. @Michael Holmes we are not degrading her maybe the judge bcs he has taken over the proceedings we are just surprised bcs he has not done so on the previous witnesses.
Mncedisi Madela,pls guys do not respond to Yose!
