Pastor J.J,@Zaahier Adonis Dont understand your question Terribly @Zaahier Adonis I perfectly understand. Enjoy the day "@Andrew Marshall I think in that part of the world the word""Dop"" is more appropriate than ""Dorp"". hahahaha" An IDIOT just joined the chat @Masked K Herschel Rhoodie and more @Robert Russell Each child 8K.Where? @Amanda Watson You are absolutely right. Well said @Mrs Anderson I already started Praying. @Robert Russell @Mrs Anderson Not necessary Russel. Keep it clean @Mrs Anderson U are 100% right. Thats why I questioned @Robert Russell Zambia I bet @I Am Free Are going to have that discussion today? Anyone on the chat is from UMBUMBULU in KZN???? @Sphe Mdluli Me too bro @Thando Nkutha Agreed
Andrew Marshall,lost you mean n Afrikaans drop
Anti Suz,I felt sorry for the interpreter. @Mbulelo Nala Ntlabati kaManona You are correct. It is also a problem because police must take all statements in English. It does not always reflect accurately what the complainant wants to declare. I love this advocate. @pieter Du Plessis. Dit is nou regtig 'n lelike en onnodige opmerking. Ek blok jou. "Mr Basson is a ""stoere boer"". I hope he has concrete evidence of the allegations his making now." "@Nkunz'emnyama what does ""ngamla"" mean."
Lucky Mthembu,hot seat 💺
Kevin Simon,I was really concerned at the poor interpretation yesterday. Wow. Is this a common problem in our courts? Officers became offices...and then it just got worse. Smart move DCJ Oom Willie appears to be quite an entrepreneur. Started saying something about delivering R1m of feed to the Vrede Dairy Scam. No he said Greyling Dumpy level = theodelite NO "When Typical low quality kit from India. Probably rusted en route. Ive seen this personally in other industries. Probably not even safe. Sounds like Zim style land grabs.....! Was this witness interviewed by our current PP? If more of the holes leaking Govt funds are blocked this country would be doing very well. Our kids futures are being stolen. This paints a sad picture of rural South Africa and poverty contrasted by extreme opulence funded by money intended to help the poor. JUST SHOCKING!!!!!!

Lots of cattle died here. Corruption at its best costing SA millions Fake JZ account blocked on my side too My brother DCJ Zondo is correct 500k is way over charged Real farmers use their money sparingly and cannot afford that kind of money. @I Am Free this really show the new owners did not know about farming.

FireLord Uncut,farms wer taken from ethnic farmers after group areas act it applys it applys because the land was never owned by them it belongs to the people of the land only u knw coz u scottish its typical raid strategy like tge vikings and roman rule thats why now europeans or caucasions can sit back and have an opinion the staduliums that exist today can be compared with the colloseums of yesterday we go back however long we can also whatever trades occured in terms of exchangung the land b4 group areas my granpa had a dairy farm and now i dont own it nor any of relatives its owned by an afrikaner who then sold it to municipality he just delaying with this translation almost like he is a school child the way she is translating the british wer messing with the scottish this guy is using strawman argument so what if zulus invaded did the british not invade scotland did the british not have sex first with the wife of scotissh as that was their sick law u just being padantic bcoz u an afrikaner and u wer living the life during apartheid and still prospering from it zuma is the man u still cant bring him down also where is the state capture of apartheid what about the money they stole they stole much more they stole and no one asked questions what about df malan how much did he steal who here still buys die burger that apartheid news paper why do schools still have apartheid lawmakers names bcoz u are still proud of them d f malan school must be renamed hendrick vervoed school must be renamed why investigate state capture on democratic history invedtigate s5ate capture on apartheid history as well it makes a difference to the kids and their upbringing its coz u are still proud of them it will help the kids coz the current youth or white youth are still racist bvoz of their proud ownership of schools such as df malan who was a racist ruler implimenting and enforc8ng apartheid "yes and so do teachers u are not african u an afrikaner which is dutch for african egyptians are african they have black dna more than 40% black dna but u are 100% dutch and u proud of being dutch thats why u supported holland in the world cup and not south africa i have an important question "whilst everyone is working  do they not work now after apartheid did they steal that much they are thiefs stolen wealth and left a legacy of prosperity for tgeir relatives to just sit at restaurants lol unemployed with millions in tge bank we need to introspect and accept that as whites we have been privaleged so wake up
Lunje Dabula,bring back the black dude the black translator zaahier that guy made my day . his direct translation we dont care about Scottish. this is the black land of our Gogos i want my land too. my great×5 grandpa had a hut there in sandton but they bulldosed it :( lol they should let this guy just answer after a question. he understands English. she should just translate Afrikaans answers what is the Afrikaans word for Guptas ? so the land belongs to Xhosa!? "@x  ink made it blue this state capture will take 6 years and no one will get jail wow cows in vrede they get babies #bring back the black translator he was well characterized too lol he says they were the Gupta's not he believes to be the Guptas why are u changing his answers
makhosi nobhatyi,There Afrikaans speaker speak there more I understand and speak today ek is Boer "Let me test the waters "Free state people you need not support these thugs
Dominic Przybylski,"Land will have no value if it can be expropriated without compensation. Anyway land is no longer of much value in business. What land does Uber Humans stole land from the animals. Gesteelde land? Only thing which belongs to us is life. The rest is for whoever wants to sacrifice their life for it. Only problem is then they don't have much of a life. @Masked K Rename anything you like. The people who they were named after were usually dead before their names were used. It makes no difference to them. "@Masked K I cannot speak for kids Some people think skin colour defines them. Let them think that. They deserve then to be classified by race and to live the miserable life of bigots. "Big difference between Ancient Egyptians and modern Egyptians @Masked K Since when does priveleged = sleeping? A person who has two children can help them to be successful in life. A person who has eight can only give a quarter that amount of help to each. Simple logic. Primitive cultures have big families because they expect only one or two children to survive. However with modern medicine most now survive so there are more and more people but land remains same. Population in Africa is growing faster than African economy can grow. Result is increasing unemployment and result of that is increasing crime and ultimately collapse and starvation. @Francel van Eeden Rand is buoyed by Brexit. Everybody moving their pounds and euros into other currencies. Rand will dive in November. I feel sorry for the rich. They have to spend all their time worrying about losing it. I prefer to have just enough so that it isn't a big loss if I lose it and am free to explore better things. Heh! Anyone who believes any politician will look after them will be disappointed. What is more important - democracy or freedom? The politicians of all colours try to get their supporters to have as many children as possible. It's the source of their power. That's why we don't hear any politician asking people to have less. "Is no coincidence that China became powerful after enforcing one-child policy Cows wrap their tongues around tuft of grass before biting. I think that's why they cannot eat short grass. Two is ideal. Then children can inherit parents land without needing more. Was the tradition in England where only the eldest son inherits wealth and title. The others get nothing. Half million is far too much to pay for a gate. I've got to get into the farm gate business. Why such a fancy gate? This witness must have been doing lot of business with government. Private sector would never pay so much for a gate. Seems like government does no work except for paying other people to do it. Why do they employ almost 2 million people? Most farms have simple gates without fancy face-brick walls or electric motors... Government spends like billionaires on holiday. @Nkululeko Zondo Combine monopoly SOEs with powerful trade unions and they will rip everybody else off. Nobody will get rewarded for working hard or putting customer first. @Nkululeko Zondo Is not possible in current system where politicians get to choose how much tax we pay and get to choose what it gets spent on. We need to move away from top-heavy government. Current system based on hierarchy is obsolete. Networks of individuals and civil society will replace it (4IR) based on social media. Will be a new different kind of revolution. @Robert Russell if the tractors survive without being broken and vandalised. "@Murugasen Ganesh We need people with ethics and integrity So the fancy gate doesn't help at all.

I like the fact that he calls the cows are lovely. he cares about the animals. please keep the chsts clean. non racial and use respect with each other. please focus on the enquiry and stop insulting one and other. the chat can be so much better when people respect each other. easy to insult if you have bad tummy. food poison you eat charcoal. just block Jacob the troll I have so cant kick him off Pieter show respect dont add to it. just block that person if you dont want to see the comments block that person. you have that right. Thando that is the best comment you made all week. let's keep it clean. 100% They should send people to agriculture schools and if the quality with good Mark's then they should be send to start farming with land that is monitored and if that person reaches the goals they keep He had to sell well run farms and now everything has been sold and nothing is functioning now. that means all employees also not working. it's like taking the CEO out of a company Thando listen to what they saying. dont say they. direct to the Person you mean. sterio type is a big issue SA needs to raise the education levels. it's the most important thing in SA. he just said the most important thing. The new farmers need to be monitored. if they dont reach some goals they must be replaced. farming is a business. Bedazzled please keep it clean. non racial ha ha Thando your thieves are in parliament Bedazzled where do you come from. where did you grow up. he is making sure all is in order Thando he is against a mafia that would not stop at shooting anyone to hide there story leave black and white out of it and look at it like good and bad. anyone that thinks farming is easy should go try it for 2 months. and also experience drought and bad weather. animal sickness and all the other things that come with it. it's a big company management Thando you need qualified people that have the skills and backing from Banks and farming organisations. if you fail to pay debt you will lose all that. very true. like he said he felt sorry for the animals when he saw them in a bad state. that's a true farmer he is also a funny man

I was born here my forefathers arrived in 1658 why am I then lambasted as non African well said I am free I do not think Zuidland will work. We will build it up make it prosperous and the ANC / EFF / white haters will then just complain about land theft and so forth Dominoque I totally agree with you but look down seems like economics and logic is also racist Mthuthuzeli Ntlanyana my question what stops anyone from starting a corner shop Mthuthuzeli Ntlanyana I have never killed someone but just because I am white I am a killer? Melvict Melbourne I agree but for that reason we can not use it as a blame game tool Melvict Melbourne dont understand your humor. I will say the same to you BAD TASTE my friend Robert that is the origin of coruption and yes there may be such cases but surely you dont want to imply that that is standard practice I can believe that ther might be such cases and that must be reported I have heard of people having kids just to get the grants but I have not witnessed it so I rather not comment on it It is sad to what extent people will go just to get money. Best thing to do is ionvest time into projects to help people not destroy people to invest I am frree lets hope it will actually be utilized for that purpose and not to enrich certain people I am actually amazed that the rand took so long to weaken One thing I must honestly Add to your coment Nkululeko Zondo is politions must do there work they suppose to do and leave our people on the ground to carry on with our lives I am free can I make a statement and will you give me an honest answer If you had bilions of dollars and employ thousands of people but most of the population just lambast and bad mouth you would you not want to leave to a place that is more welcoming Nkululeko Zondo so why do we keep on voting for them Nkululeko Zondo totally agre. we should use our only democratic power we have and stop voting on emotion but on reality I blocked that nperson so I dont see his idiotic responces just googled cable price 16mm cable is R 124.00 per metre so I can understand the price he will loose his contracts and money and farms within the next year. the influential people will stop at nothing to destroy this poor guy now It is not about black and white its about influenced people and the police and npa

Robert Russell,@Dominic Przybylski the reason more children are born is that they get registered multiple times by family members to claim up to 10 child grants per child.... each child is worth around R8k per month A child grant is around r780 per month x 10 times being registered R7.8k Ask Home Affairs and SASSA.... that's why they are going to start finger printing new born babies to stop the theft Not when applying for a social grant @Amanda Watson @Mrs Anderson @Pastor J ...... keep your divine intervention and wake up to the corruption and theft happing around you So you are telling me that new born babies are finger printed at SASSA when applying for a child support grant??????? @Mrs Anderson "For the last time.... a mother registers for a child grant.. the next day her sister takes the same baby and registers it again @Francel van Eeden I'm not saying it's standard practice... it was in response to why some people have so many kids.... and I know this happens for sure So when every one is given a their land and FREE tractor.. I think there is going to be a huge 2nd hand market for tractors and farm implements..which can be sold to Zimbabwes white returning farmers He should name them now..... otherwise he is going to be bumped off The DCJ wants the statement before he gets bumped off """""they will shot me"""" DCJ...... """"Ok that's Fine"""" 😃" What about Thandi Modesi's cruelty case for neglecting all those animals on her farm...

Interesting. Tenders!
collen khangwelo,Borewors everyone 🤗
Lorna Kavanagh,This is gross negligence of the cattle. Prasad watched the cattle die. That is what happened in Zimbabwe too... the farms and all the equipment and cattle were given to the rich people/ministers who just let them go. So the farming industry failed. Zimbabwe is in so much trouble. Jankelson said dairy farming is a science. Commercial farming feeds a nation but subsistence farmers only feed themselves or a village...
Philisiwe kw,they said cattle guys not humans
Nellie Price,The b est thing that could happen to our country is this State Capture...bring the culprits to justice..and CHAIR you are MAGNIFICENT in handling this !!!!!!!! Let us see what they are going to do about all this corruption and Zuma specifically..if he is innocent he has nothing to fear..if not..it is going to be a nightmare sir!!!!! "What they do not understand is that this country will be going to the slums...our people cannot get jobs not YET! The more you answer to this monkeys posts the happier you are making him! IGNORE him PLEASE! Be wise! YOUTUBE is not doing their job well in allowing this person as Zuma! GO WORK for it! I AM Free...CORRECT! And THAT is a fact! Corruption is EVERYWHERE in our system! True! TRUE! They were just picking on you! They speak 4 languages already! TRUE! YES! GET them ALL who are corrupt! WHIES included! My personal view is that when you run with the corrupt you ARE corrupt also! CORRECT! How did you get THREE farms????WITH everything on it(animals?) "Michael Wild IF Basson was guilty..he deserves the penalty that will follow! AGREED! SAD! "We shouldnot feel alone LOL I LOVE this STATE CAPTURE!!! GET them ALL! They have to be SURE! Bedazzeled you are living in the past! Bedazzled: We must change this mind set QUICKLY! "True When one is of two different ethnicisity one tends to SEE where the problem lies! Simple! "They should change very QUICKLY...Trump already called South Africa a ""shithole""!!!" We are going to get help from NOWHERE! Me too! Think so too! INTERPOL is the answer! Africa we will be like the rest of you VERY shortly! NO LOL LOL Remeber this! ANC consists of WHITE and BLACK members! True! Me too! He can speak English! It is better to translate for the sake of the INQUIRY! True! Really? How? It is! Imagine people drink contaminated milk! True! GOVERNMENT? We are in this food shortage already because 30.000 farmers are already feeding the Australians!!! IN Australia! "I Am Free! I understand that more is going....another 10 000 that means that only 10 000 will be left to feed this country! Scary True! TRUE! They ARE eating dung in other countries that had the same problem! Those poor poor children! I think he will leave too! He is! On a farm..Karoo!
