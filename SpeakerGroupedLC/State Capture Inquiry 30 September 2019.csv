Alogeng Ditire,can't see the witness
johannes seekoei,instead of fixing the problem of the country they printing fingers its 10 steps back he don't want to be seen jah don't think so true and murders poor guy but still in danger
zintle ndzwangu,South Thug Africa Even Indians are looting... What is to become of this country mara? @peter sikoshule I agree. I dont understad why they have to hide them. This would have been fun had this witness came out like Agrizzi. We want to see him.. He was also corrupt mos. Why is he even in protection and not in Prison cells? @Eliot Chauke I too dont get it. What a waste of our time. He's a thug too.. He cant even remember certain details of his evidence. Haisuka... Kudlalawa ngathi @Immanuel @Yolo More Why are we even protecting criminals in the 1st place? Is he crying? Lol @Lorna Kavanagh thank you!!!! @Gee Peex1 Agent of what maybe? @Gee Peex1 Oh yes i am! @Heather Cotton I doubt it. Who is Ranjeni? If i may """im not sure"" ""I can not recall"" ""I can not remember""" What can this witness RECALL? @Sihle Xhakaza Injalo nje!
Salmaan Abrahams,I dnt like this advocate the witness is in protection guptas wanna do it from another country on their terms the name is fake migoeng I also wanna loot 🤣 "fmo1....02 the names are already provided but because of witness sensitivity the codes must be used "I'm dik of shamila too "leave naidoo "crooks of note  no geepeex be must also fall I want all of them to fall ya zintle are u an agent geepeex what is Islamic geepeex 🚶🏽‍♂️ that may very apply when we live amongst ppl who give respect and take care for the lives of others our leaders are living in safety so that's of no concern to them no Islam teachers to obey the leaders here my leaders are the leaders of the country oooh media being exposed now ulama and its definition is relative 1🚶🏽‍♂️ @yin 100% we already know his house is in kempton park
Peter Machailo,what let's wait for tribunal tomorrow to recover all these monies in corr0tion corruption
johanna mogoeng,Who’s the witness? Can’t see his face 😵 It’s Col Naidoo So why hide the face but mention the name 😴 I wanna watch his body language.. People really get emo when the safety of their loved ones gets threatened 💔 This commission won’t end well Blood will be shed
sifundo mlondi,they refuse Gupta this privilege of testify through this process AI state capture inquiry is a joke
Yolo More,Johanna Mogoeng. It's MZEKEZEKE😂😂😋😋 Guptas are not on protection. Yes Elliot Zintle they tried to kill him many time because he spilled the beans now he must be protected. He is not lying. Zintle he is the state witness. Gee Nomgcobo Jiba killed all the evidence. Batohi must start afresh. He is crying "Ace Gee😂😂😂😂😋😋😋😋 Shame poor wife.She had to suffer this much because of corruption "Ace Mzilikazi waAfrica Sindiswa😂😂😋😋 Ranjeni again? Zintle she is Sunday Times journalist The Chair is in charge and I like it.😆😆 "Gee Sindi and he is doing perfectly fine. DCJ at his best✌️✌️✌️
Eliot Chauke,Naidoo is in Mumbai🤣 FMO9... is it a code for somebody? ok So the guy dont wanna be seen. and he dont wanna mention names. Whats the point of his protection... wasteful expenditure @peter. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 He's a spy... he cant give all details... just like Zuma did... 'i dont know' @Gee 🤣🤣🤣🤣 This Commission lack 1 thing... Liar Detector Test. could've saved out Tax. and this whole process could've concluded long time ago. she's racist. she has no respect for African names @kay u need to be a spy to get the truth from a spy. "i wish people can also understand when President Zuma say
Tladi Leolo,Colonel Naidoo is in protection therefore because of the new identity they have to hide his face
peter sikoshule,this thing of calling alleged corrupt ppl f1 and f08 not helping . they need to name and shame this ppl for us to get to know the truth means we need to know them this guy sound like Owen da gama 🤣🤣🤣 tjoooooooooo Rangeni again
Pastor J.J,I confess. I am JB007. James Bond 007 "For those with short memories. In the earlier days of Zuma being Deputy President and then President yes 100% correct Sindiswa @olebile olebile I cannot recall Agrizzi implicating his wife? @Immanuel Yes he also was a spokesperson at some time @Gee Peex1 Remind me please. How was she implicated? @Gee Peex1 I cant accept that in any shape or form to be implicated in State Capture. My wife tells me everyday to be careful. What should that mean? @Gee Peex1 . I must be clear that I am not playing ignorant on this aspect but I am ignorant. I did not hear any evidence as such to hide illicit dealings...... @Anne M. . My understanding of that aspect was to lighten the tax burden. Possibly a form of tax evasion.
Sindiswa Moolman,Not all parts of it @Gee Peex1 Better safe than sorry @I am Free They thrive on negative energy supply @I am Free My thought exactly @Yolo More Is FM09 a radio station? Sounds like the Chair is playing a role of the Evidence Leader So Ranjenis account with WesBank was paid and the maintenance thereof done and costs covered by the CI Are you a ghostbuster @Born Free? Why do they show us an empty chair instead of focusing the camera on the chair and the evidence leader The final report is expected in June 2020. But he promised us an interim report so that the Hawks and others can start their jobs Only now she’s no longer a friend of Zuma and Malema @olebile olebile Agreed @Sihle Xhakaza I remember @Pastor J. She was also a spokesperson for Friends if Zuma cabal Ranjeni is busy wth her response to all these allegations against her. She’s working with her attorneys as we speak. So guys be ready... she’s coming here. Maybe he still had the flu @Heather Cotton Has @Heather Cotton Who has put him on this WP programme?
Immanuel,"@zintle this witness is under witness protection and thus in a safe house. As a precautionary measure "so why in some instances there is name dropping whereas in other its FMZ? @onie because they did not put their makeup on😁😁😁🤣🤣 "there you have it "@lisanda "@sindiswa i think thats why they call it state capture so are they going to put tea on the witness stand? its tea time now🤣🤣 was mac maharaj not the spokesperson though? "after this commission has concluded its function another one must be constituted to inquire why the zondo commission was not conscious on time or time management is wanting this commission is not doing well on time management akere?🤷‍♀️ @gee payments were approved by FM100🤣 ahhh witness protection for 8 years and still counting🤷‍♀️ wow msanzi "2002 col was a clerk then in 2010 promoted to liue col selective memory of this witness i can discern who is beki jele? does anyone know?

ACE MABEKA,FMO 1 OR 2 STAND FOR? yolo more@ why don't mention them....
Lorna Kavanagh,We need to see the big names involved in the looting of this country. They need to be brought to the commission by force if need be . The commission has enough evidence to give the NPA to start prosecutions and arrests . It just goes to show ... people are not what the seem. used to follow her on twitter. The poor judge is not well for a long time now. ... until all criminals are in jail.
Zamokuhle Zwane,I wonder who will write a movie script for these proceedings.
JG,Is this not streaming Live on ENCA anymore "Ranjeni is treated like a Queen with CI doing her errands regards Car Yeh Great Asset to them but now a liability to Tax Payer
Pheladi Lamola,Sounds like a movie. Yho We hope so @Heather Cotton No Sindiswa😂😂 Ranjeni again. Ayeye But how can he be unsure of how he got there? @Mario Johnson because her surname is spelt Munusamy. Maybe there are others where the u is silent and others pronounce it with the u. Ranjeni was spoilt yho. The car doesn't start she calls crime intelligence? Wow 🤣🤣🤣 this lady's pronunciation of Cele is hilarious "My question is did these people honestly believe they would be in their positions until they died because wow

Kay Kay,fm 09 mzilika WA Africa Rajeni! Ndlozi told us that Rajeni and few of her colleagues are embedded journalists hired to advance an agenda of certain politicians. now stories are coming I wonder how much more will be revealed when general Mdluli has to come here "can imagine cross examining a spy I'm starting to admire cln Naidoo's bravery for spinning the bean even if it may has to cause his life I wonder whether or not his evidence may end up roping in Zuma somewhere somehow? 😂😂😂 is fm 09 part of SABC or private radio station? cameraman please keep the camera away whenever Zondo has cotton to his nose it looks unprofessional. thank you Are there technicians in Naidoo's room or how was the sound gonna be fixed? "The damm cameraman is annoying now Mdluli let's hear now "I learn it here also that Maleka left beki Cele what?? Beki Cele became wealthy of what? eish beki Cele Zondo is careful with this witness "There's a gap Zondo is literally saying do not lie This assumption story will weaken his testimony why does he assume the money was given to Mr. Cele? how is easy is it to get the truth out of a spy? Zondo has now put on his real judge jacket to nail this witness Isn't Zondo busy with low key type of cross examination?
