Slindile Ngcobo,hi "@Floyd Ramoshaba .....YES HE IS HERE TO STAY @Blaze 613 ...Not anything like PORK....hehe Evidence Leader is Advocate REFILOE MOLEFE
Viewing,"@Ryan Smith He will be gone soon @Floyd Ramoshaba Nope. Land belongs to the people who paid for their land and who have title deeds. No free squatters and land grabs. We don't want more shacks around our neighborhoods. Go make your own. @Belinda Niemand Government land is being taken. Private land is being stolen. Blacks want everything for FREE=EFF 100% "@Born free Indeed Rand is nearly R16 to the Dollar @Belinda Niemand Kruger Rand! Buy your cars and motorcycles now. "Most importantly @I Am Free Almost yes @I Am Free I bought 350 000 rand's worth of Kruger Rand before the rand collapsed @I Am Free II knew it was coming @I Am Free When we're officially in 100% junk status we lose all investments from other countries. Lol Land for what? More shacks. "@Born free I am not giving my farm away. My weapons are loaded @I Am Free Become a member of USAF "@I Am Free You can invest your money into kruger rand with the ""pay app""" Looks like we're going to be neighbors On pc it's very small i have to check your profile üòÉ "@Born free EFF/ANC/BLF is using Hitler's old tactics @Born free I agree @I Am Free How is the weather? I'm in JHB @I Am Free Indeed! The Chinese bought a huge piece of land above Port St Johns where they are busy with plans for a Mega City. Remember China is bankrupt and imploding with 52 million empty homes @I Am Free I actually like the manners of the Zimbabwe people. They don't involve the race card every 2 seconds. @I Am Free We can see the globalists took control of South Africa when Zuma/Ramaphosa started getting comfortable with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton @jasper dougal People are rushing to get out of China "@jasper dougal Tourists going in are usually captured into prisons  @I Am Free Actually not a bad goal @Nkululeko Zondo The Economy can grow when thee people stop abusing our taxes and grant services. Including stopping the daily corruption and Riots. "@I Am Free I understand what you mean @I Am Free The stress that comes with high paying jobs. "@Nkululeko Zondo I'm working for mainline engineering as a civil engineer Personal life doesn't matter with higher paying jobs "@I Am Free More money @jasper dougal I see other humans as NPC's. The NPC theory explains what happened to our Politics. @I Am Free I can be happy off grid with no electricity. But the danger in South Africa made that possibility nearly impossible to do it. If they take away property rights 100%. South Africa will be in chaos no doubt. Have you guys seen the laws they are trying to amend? They are trying to make it legal for Trespassers. If land is easily Available then go work a job and pay for it. That easy. @jasper dougal The Inequality is on all minorities. BEE is basically apartheid. @jasper dougal Indeed they blame apartheid but that's a easy card to play. They never explained why Apartheid happened or who had the first apartheid in South Africa The British Imperial Army had our Minorities under concentration camps to starve to death including my great grandfather. That was the first Apartheid in South Africa. Blacks sold their own as slaves. Zulu's and Bantu's because they invaded on a huge scale the British Imperial Army could not capture or kill them all so instead they arranged with the leaders to buy people and sell them as slaves. "@I Am Free Both sides "@I Am Free I just finished reading completely "@I Am Free You have a bloodline of survivors

BEE-llionaire Okwacha,6 page business plan and spend more than 200 Million? I guess they just compile a simple profile and budget they needed. how does he comment with certainty on feasibility study. when he was introduced they said he is an Agric economist. maybe before they criticize they should have told who prepared this FS Who prepared the Feasibility Study for the project?

PETER STAFFEN,Were is Rassie going "Rob Nel  Peet Venter sorry for ignorance but aint 45 litre of milk heavy for one cow Daud i sorry Peet Venter thought so but thanks for the info zuma will face the music
Peet Venter,1000 cows in milk at 45lt per cow would require bulk milk tanks with a 45 000lt capacity. I have yet to see those size tanks on one farm. @Peter Staffen Only about 3% of cows in SA produce 45lt per day. The national ave is about 20lt. The national record holder about 10 years ago was a cow named Seragossa from Humansdarp area at about 65lt.

Evans Miller,Fix the sound it‚Äôs coming on the left side only
Cathren Nkgoeng,Zuma will have to come he can't just start something and leave hanging on a thread
Born free,This is the reason Africa is a failed continent and has to depend on handouts and aid from Europeans. It's the government people that steal the money. Zuma is a coward Correct. No where in this world do you get to have land for nothing. BEE has ruined this country. Where in the world do you see this terrible practice against a minority. All the experienced people have left. Blacks had tribal land. Whites paid for their land. If you paid for the land it is not stolen. Blacks did nothing with the land . Black people are being fooled into believing they will own land. the truth is the government will own the land and charge for it by leasing it. Nothing is for free. Those idiotic parties will go down in flames. Because you see open land it does not mean it can be used for human habitation. There are many geotechnical and environmental reasons why some land cannot be used.

jasper dougal,"The Chinese are amongst the most intolerant people towards immigrants "Yes  "Why do you think that China is not being a place where immigration presents as a problem  We live in a World now where the people know the cost of everything and the value of nothing ! Capitalism has brought us to this "Capitalism has attached a cost to everything  "There is no CEO on this earth who deserves the salary that they get paid "Just how much money does one need before you say enough  "When inequality exists as it does now  "We need for there to be fairness  "If you could choose  This Commission is just Window dressing for the masses. What can they do if everyone chooses to take it on Review? They would be in Court for years to come lol "At the end of this everyone implicated will demand a review in Court and then what  None of the facts established here will count for anything in your HighCourts. So it‚Äôs a very expensive waste of time "It‚Äôs a smoke and mirrors act  Pretty privileged ! Puurrrr Unfortunately he lost all his lives Died of old age "22 years old 
Derek Main,neither Capitalism is the mother of fascism. Stop the gravy train. Trickle down doesn't work and never will. Those on top always use bigger and bigger glasses so not much trickles down. The Shoprite CEO wanted his salary increased to R33 mil pa!!! That's without shares options and other benefits. A teller in a Shoprite store would take 50 years to earn what the CEO earns in 1 month! Capitalism is a disease. We need a revolution. You would think - but greed knows no limits.
