Moonchild,There is so much background noise! That's why these people should appear in person. Hi @ALTA 🙂 hope you had a Happy New Year! This Mr Barry attorney of Koko's is the most unpleasant individual - rude & disrespectful! "@Lerato Moleke - unbelievable! There are so many capable Advocates (Black & White) & I cannot understand why he would choose this unpleasant @Louis C - you are so right! 🤣 Awesome @Blake Yogi - well done! Bye @ALTA  @Fred Desrosiers - exactly & it's all our tax-payers money that they have stolen & squandered!! @Danile Ngubenyathi - click on the smiley face icon below & it will bring up the picture icons that you can insert. What a repulsive little man!!! @Heather Durr of course! @S V 1 - absolutely He's crossing his arms as a show of aggression. DCJ must put him in his place "@Helene Nortje - yip The Commission is completely entitled to issue letters & now this clown is objectiving to the tone of the letter! What an absolute idiot!  "@Godfrey Maumela - must be He must shut up when DCJ is speaking!!! DCJ should not allow this disgusting character to keep speaking over him! @Elaine Pridgeon-Alberts - yes @Power Electronics - rather take your racism & go elswhere. It is easy to come to a livestream under a pseudonym & make racist comments! Please get off. "He is just a disrespectful DCJ must now allow him to carry on with these delay tactics!!! *Not allow him @a b c - agreed "Come on @S V 1 - are you talking about the Adv? @S V 1 - absolutely & so is Koko "This Koko is the slimiest character This is so pathetic. Poor Koko - the big victim @Phakamani Gazu - these corrupt individuals have to come up with an excuse for their criminal activities. They will use any means they can to try & divert their own guilt. @Tommy Kernaghan - my thoughts exactly! "@Thulani Sokhela - yes Tell him to sit the f...... down!!!!!!!!!!!!! @Hloni Mofokeng - I think the commission has done a sterling job in light of their resources & the amount of corruption they have to get through "@Power Electronics - yes & I don't agree with it @Sal SA - huh? what does that mean? @Hloni Mofokeng - Adv Seleka eplained it clearly but they will hand over all the records I have such respect & admiration for these Evidence Leaders & DCJ for having to be on top of such huge amounts of information & lead individuals who are clearly corrupt. "@Quinton van Eeden - yes In his R20k suit using our money to live in the lap of luxury!! @Ngubs Ngubane - who is WMC? Pray tell @Teunis van Ree - 🙂 I get taken in every time!!!  "@Heather Durr - yup "@Pieter de Villiers - yup "@Pieter de Villiers - 100% - they purport to care & act for the poor Adv Seleka is an extremely accomplished lawyer & I hold him in the highest regard. The problem with lying is that you always have to remember what you said! The cracks are starting to show Mr Koko! What I can't understand is how these top IT tech guys could not identify the Businessman email address with absolute certainty @Sal SA - very strange @Tommy Kernaghan - is that why they haven't been able to uncover to whom the address belongs to? @Tommy Kernaghan - I would think so but that's why I find it strange that they haven't found the email owner yet. @Bongani Njapha - I thought it was WMC? Obviously they won't use the normal salutations in order to avert suspicion!!! Liars always slip up eventually Here we go - go off on a tangent to divert attention from his guilt @sandile nzuza - if you think that then YOU are the clown! @Bongani Njapha - do you support corruption then & the patronage network that has brought this country to its knees? "@Ismail Petersen - ha ha "@Bulali Pepeteka - Correct "@Pastor J.J - yes "@Pastor J.J - ha ha @Bulali Pepeteka - I was a child & lived through it so that is my direct experience. Most whites were kept in the dark while the NP elite ran the country. Now it is just reverse apartheid @Sibusiso Mbhele - Salim Esse @Sibusiso Mbhele * Saleem Esse "This slithery snake thinks he can outwit DCJ & Seleka "@Bulali Pepeteka - no we were not & I've already said it was wrong! The problem is that our democracy is slowly deterioriating into communism & a cleansing of all minorities @Martha Sello - DCJ is anything but!! Koko is the clown. "@Heather Durr - yes "@Nick Matyida - that is hysterical Bye @Nick Matyida - I respect your opinion & I would appreciate you to respect me. How I choose to engage has absolutely nothing to do with you my friend. @Heather Durr - 😅🤣😂 hear hear Everyone else is lying but not me Chairman 😪 Go Seleka! Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

At least we should all hope so @Dylan Jacklin I suspect that justice will come only when the ANC is gone and has no power to protect the thieves anylonger @Dylan Jacklin absolutely right. That is more than enough reason to declare luthuli house a prison. we keep them right there @Dylan Jacklin They and the DCJ sometimes do.

Bel Potenger admitted they made WMC up to dellect and protect the Guptas a fleet of buses on the way

Mbulelo Marhaule,"Koko is gonna implicate a big gun
Keith Kriel,"Those who are still involved in corruption at Escom Koko amazed that the person he was sending emails to is Essa. One can see that he is as innocent as driven snow. He is obviously a honest man with integrity and high moral standards. NOT!!
Mkholo M,Have all of you questioned why this Commission is only following 5 - 10% of spent not the deals for 90 - 95% of procurement spent?
Phumezo Jijana,I see the RET loonies are in the LIVE chat 😂 "lol Koko is slowly starting to crack if these so called Guptas and Salim Essa are innocent why did they skipped the country. "And how can Koko "No break DOJ What if the Guptas are watching this LIVE chat? 😂 What would you say to them? 🤣
Kevin Simon,Almost like he doesn't want to see the page

Pieter de Villiers,R500 billion that just went missing is hardly WMC for example @Kerry van Schalkwyk - yep - now they are saying that they should have started with vaccine in July 2020 and have built manufacturing plants for this - so the poor people once more suffers and dies @Thulanie Sokhela - WMC is a term created by a company called Bell Pottanger - they were hired by the Guptas to cover their image in the media and divert attention from what the were doing @Thulani Sokhela - nope - BEE does not allow that
NOMKHOSI Netsianda,@mkholo M the DCJ has requested that if anyone has information regarding the 90%-95% you referring to should bring it to the commission. Crying here about 5%-10% that is being pursued is not helping can't ignore email from the *chair *businessman 🚮 parliamentary version... let's go:elbowcough: error of memory 😅:elbowcough:

Kabelo Mnisi,Adv Seleka is not as smart as i thought unless if he is just executing instruction from higher power that he is finding hard to execute in this commission This circus though @Precious Zara how did we sold our souls here?
Sanele Sibisi,Seleka guy is lazy and he brings no confidence in whatever he says
Siphiwo Landu,silence please
Qwemesha TheFirst,"silence please is a joke
lilizela mlilizeli,Seleka is not lazy but his demeanor is laid back how can you communicate with an email so much and not pick up it is not Ngubane you talking to he even said give the attachd to the boss This one reminds me of my former rogue senior manager...master of deflacting the smiling assassin - seleka
MAKWENA BUTHANE,been searching for too long to find Seleka intelligence 🤔 "indeed Koko is super intelligent
Michelle Wright,This Koko has a bad attitude!!! The truth always hurts!!!

Gugulethu Dube,Koko gave the most implausible explanation closest to Ndzeku by alleging he thought @businessman was Ben Ngubane Remember that @businessman account was in existence before Ben Ngubane joined Eskom
Leehle Sithole,some of you seem to have concluded that koko is corrupt
Bulali Pepeteka,Sifiso consistency. Pravin was allowed the same privilege  Quinton can you say what you are implying and not hiding behind the 30% racist rhetoric  "@Quinton can Eeden that is not the case at all. Please do your research. And why are you implying that people on this forum only passed with 30% for that matter "@Kerry van Schalkwyk would it be accurate to say people who were living complacent during apartheid unaffected "@Kerry Van Schalkwyk can you please provide reference of 90% figure. I fail to believe the majority of whites didn’t see blacks being policed out of their spaces. Using their tax @Kerry van Schalkwyk was your family forcefully removed from their house and placed in the eastern cape? Are you not allowed in ‘black areas’? What makes a democracy reverse apartheid? Adv Seleka is arguing over semantics here. Whether he called him or vice versa they still communicated. He is just trying to discredit the witness. Which is his job to be fair @Mduduzi he has provided telephone records that he called the CEO prior?

Koko should have insisted that Dr Ngubane gets an Eskom e-mail address "@Martha Sello Remember he said that Ms Daniels gave him this email address as that of the Chairperson. And I would have told her that @Gugulethu Xhosans Koko never admitted that he was talking to Salim in 2015. He said he is flabbergasted and angry if the e-mail address he was sending the mails to belong to Salim. @Ismail Petersen not Gerrie but the lady who is leading in the SAA saga @Santa Kriel Adv Kate is dangerous

MOSA AUBREY,Koko is smart and he is speaking the truth "@vish nothing will incriminate him "most Whites and Indians are not listening attentively

Moatli Mohale,@kerry the fact is that you knew how blacks were unfairly treated - only white were given high position in both private and government the government contracts/tenders were given only to white. @itumeleng but you can't comment on the issues relating appartheid without mentioning race cards. @Mosa thats true they can't even relate themselves with the evidence put before them. @Mandla how did you come with that conclusion
