Walter Mercuur,the SOUND is poor
Hiltonw111,Is it intentional to have poor sound. Doesnt sound like a cure. SABC wants to know why no one wants to pay TV licenses. Quality of broadcasting is at all time low Incompetence at its best.
Corus Mabulwana,Tune in to SA FM to deal with the sound issue "I'm viewing the footage here We actually work and can't take our TVs with us to work Phindile.

Phindile Mazibuko,if we all pay the tv licence sabc can afford better technology for our benefit i can tell that all of us here dont pay the tv licence because enca are privately funded like koos botha if we the so called literate can pay our tv licence .it can go a long way in assisting thr poorest of the poor "@sibu zwans not the minister the whole anc cabinet .if i may ask can u trust ace  ramaphosa is very dignified .ubaba and his gangsters nearly killed the anc no wonder why ace and supra are organising the mafias to fight back its because Zuma have got some dirts on him zuma is the worst president ever to come out of my Anc its only hitting him now that the guptas have stolen so much billions all the did is to give his kids crumps and they ram away with the real bread the parastatals have collapsed because of him .so where must we get the money ask the guptas what they did at denel and the shelve company in china where they diverted the funds to dubai usually a benefector of corruption will fight to the better ends at the expense of their poor @thando nkutha all u are trying to say is that mcebisi.should have taken that evil money for us not to label him a liar all i knows is all in all someone would have had a courage to say no to the guptas .the anc of mandela would never have accepted what the Gupta's were doing in Sa.thanks to jonas
Lookingroom Pictures,shame sabc now we all have to find alternative to watch this....#Sound
BEE-llionaire Okwacha,Do we have Vuvuzela guys checking this audio thing? Did they ask him if he was ever at the Gupta Compound before he became the minister and after "No This is not a soup. he should have let him answer

Mpilo Mthiyane,Ai Kanti were wasting time.
Mpumelelo Nkosi,"@Desmond Masilela  uBaba is an operative...a great leader. the corruption allegations just taint him. The inquiry is not a court...it recommends... @uBaba is the real OG!!! @Thando Nkutha uthini? "Lol hey @Lizette van Greunen SABC cash strapped so let's bare with them lol. "on face value SOE were never meant to be profit making...their purpose to to meet the nation's needs of Employment and infrastructure without concern of profit margins... Anyone with a crack of Filmora?
cecil thurston vanreenen,"ubaba was the best president we ever had people is paying huge money to taint ubaba image then block me "He was better than mandela
MAGIC THAKENG,enquiry is waste of money
Sihesenkosi Mtimbane,@Magic Thakeng but we have a right to know the truth regardless of the expenses..
Lizette van Greunen,Sound very bad!
CataclysmZA,"prediction: Nene will be found to have been complicit in state capture "It wouldn't have been a R600m transfer Gives you an idea of how much money was taken out of the country through the Gupta's antics. "Also Today's meeting probably finishes at 5PM. The commission itself might take another month or two to finalise their report.
Pumlani Mkotyana,@cecil thurston vanreenen ubaba was not and will never be the best president. Zuma damaged his name not people
Keatlaretse Phetwe,They said he's all over them but yet nowhere... He was 1 of the best.. Noe we have to approach IMF... Who cares about you....I dnt.. So thando is scared and a dictator??? And he's emotional??? Using appartheid tactics and has no balls??? I dont need ur comments sir.. Now back to business...I say under JZ there were no petrol hikes....I can barely afford.. Cyril enriched himself since 94... Prooof??? "We r still getting ther "All you guys know is the word state capture See????Phindile cant think beyond state capture.. "Do you know ""Bidvest???" Thats the budget of GCIS???? So he wanted to buy us a refinery??? He wanted to buy us a refinery from some arabian dude.. I thot I heard so... Or from Saudi or sumthing... I think so... S blind people always say... "Now atleast ppl r beginning to say JZ's decision was not so bad Is NENE boring so far or is it me??? So Nhlanhla wasnt fired for not refusing to procure nuclear?? So u guys are disappointed??? I told you guys...It doesnt mean you are right just because you are a group???It just makes you a foolish group... "In fact Its just ppl are not listening...Or just are obssessed with damaging Zuma's name.. "THats not the point Mogorosi The intention was the point... "And another fact "Thiza 1. nENE WAS FIRED FOR THE REFINERY DEAL... What facts do u bring MASAMBAG.. Why was he fired? I know it would.. By saying wat MASAMBAG?

Viral Videos,Mourinho Out --- Agree?
Maanda Manyatshe,I enjoy clarity of presentation by Minister Nene "They wanted to buy Engen Refinery No..the refinery was being bought by Petrosa...so it was going to be a national asset....it was actually not a bad idea except for the fact that we wanted to pay 2X its value...overpriced that is Engen= Petronas ......Mobil sold long time ago in 1992/93...... "The proposal was not bad at al...in fact Thinks are not so clear now... We should blame the petrol price to the government that adopted the ZAR/USD exhange and international crude oil price ...with this formula adopted by parliament .. it does not matter who is the presi

Mlondolozi Msimango,can someone assist me as to when is this inquiry suppose to finish on
Lerato Reffly,msimango apparently it will take 2 years
Thiza William,what's wrong about Cyril enriching himself if he broke no law or committed any crime Some attack people for their success driven by vitriolic jealousy of ones success if there's any information compromising against Nene avail it to the Judge or open a criminal case than to play politics Anyone in possession of incrementing evidence to Nene present it to the Judge or forever shut up with gossips To defend Zuma says a lot about you but don't drag us to your level "I for one will defend my intelligence from being abused and insulted by those who saw Because facts are in front of us and if Zuma is of higher intellect let him appear before the commission or courts to clear his name Birds of the same feather always flock together if you're in possession of facts come before Zondo and subject yourself to cross examination It's not a debate but discussion and the difference between is debate deals with untested opinions that never matter while discussion is driven by facts
Masha Mogorosi,"Procedure was not follwed  @Keatlaretse Phetwe procedure was not followed
makofane tshepho,@PHETWE thing is that we dont know who was going to own the asset government/Guptas. who knows the asset could have been bought at high price and sold to Guptas at price which is below market value. "I GUESS SOON WE WILL KNOW

Starsky Hudge,Sound is very bad
Emihle Ngcakaza,"Somewhere
makhosi nobhatyi,Nene is here to expose Zuma and Son and Guptas If EFF has all information must come forward not to make an accusation which is baseless they do so to gain more votes When you testify at any court you need to accurately so I don’t blame him reading his statements so that commissioner doesn’t correct him according to his statement
ELFO BKK,state of decay those eyes
Matshidi Letsoela,what is happening the sound is poor

Anele Solethu Mpambane,"no matter what anyone can say "oh and by the way "guys do not be confusedwith EFF before testimony i mean
ntokozo vincent Sikakane,why is Nene reading his answers something fishy
Ashwyn Watkins,EFF must bring the evidence... one cannot make allegations and not have the proof ... We want all these corrupt individuals exposed Renewable and alternative energy is so much cheaper than nuclear... But nuclear is required... a mixed energy grid would be great especially because fossil fuel is really expensive... We moving to electrical vehicles we will need more supply... like I said a mixed source grid will be great for the economy... There is no such thing as black incompetence.. only poor leaders Zumas adminstration failed our country... Corrupt tribalists... Can't wait for the to probe transnet Nothing wrong with comminism on paper but people do not practice it I disagree with you Jeremy Jeremy you wrong... Where in the world has the west not interfered with communism??? Sanctions Wars Assassinations!! History is written by the winner
Mulunghisi Hlengani,sorry if eff have full prove they like to much to go upfront why they are not on the press conference "if minister and former president Zuma are are attacking each other like this
Cleford Maluleke,"..
Frank M,EFF + DJ Martinengo =🦍🐒 Nooo That EFF of yours think are smarter than who. What about their Dark secret.
karabo moloi,EFF was waiting for him to appear first and they'll speak after
Keith Williams,nuclear energy produces nuclear waste. SA should stay away from nuclear energy. They missed the bullet with the apartheid regime acquisition of nuclear weapons from Israel to wipe out Africa. No it is not. The world is moving in the direction of non nuclear renewable energy. Read. I wrote that it would be presented as that. I did not say that blacks were incompetent. Africa and the Caribbean have the most conducive environments for solar and other forms of energy. We need to stop trying to be clones of the movements of others. What is racism. Racism is the belief in human superiority. Stop echoing the obtuse revision of this practise.
Paul de Bruyn,This whole excersize has a main objective. To allocate so called consultation fees worth millions. Its a blatant attemot to syphen out more state funds!! there are cheaper and bio friendly mesathods of energy production. Nuclear is NOT an option!!We have sun and wind as well as water energy generation resources to our advantage. DITCH NUCLEAR POWER!
ross claassens,Will there be a conclusion that resolves this issue
Dario Tekle,The Russians have nothing for them self. so how they can build anything in AFRIKA? look at there country.
Thamsanqa Nomayela,If EFF have something they know they must come forward to the Zondo Commission.
Tanaka Chirundu,HAHAHA FROM THE THE THE FORMER PRESIDENT
Greg Stewart,hate is a harsh word koi koi and san property only the world still blames hitler and most south africans blame apartheid - so - it never ends
Thabo the Doctor,Jacob Zuma was not a bad President "10 years from now if petrol is sitting at 25 When do we stop blaming Zuma? Which decision did Zuma make that is still affecting us now @ Thando lets be respectful please. "@ Keatlaretse @ Thiza what makes u so sure that ur of higher level? I still believe nuclear was gonna benefit our country. Why do we think ubaba did not understand financials?
pierre badenhorst,"russia is a big place you cant hate everyone dont agree hard yards ahead but ships turning imagine zuma won anc election
Wilhelm5381,don't agree... he ruined SA... now SA is a basket case thanks to him... SA will become like Somalia... let's see what we can do to prevent that happening...
BORE ESAU Motsoso,I am of the view of Nene is a big liar. why you read things that happened to you instead of talking. Mcebisi never read he just talk because those things happened to him directly. I agree with Eff to spell the beans for South African to see who is the liar about the State Capture If it is not zuma is apartheid shifting of blame😎
Godfrey Malele,when he is in jail
Willard Tsoka,When shall we stop pointing blêmes on Zuma
Bos Boingotlo,the truth shall set him free @MASAMBAG THAT IS SO TRUE
MASAMBAG,Thando all decisions that Zuma made while president are affecting us today and will still affect us tomorrow what facts are you on about Keatlaretse ? but Nene has just told the country why he was fired and why do you dispute that ? "I bring no facts "1. Nene has indicated that the country was not going to afford the nuclear deal
Jeremy Vindiciam Libertatis,Of course these Communists are doing business with Russia. So much corruption. "There most certainly is something wrong with it "Marxism is a disaster "Don't sign anything with those Russians; you'll really be speaking State capture "Look at every nation that has implemented it gone. "Fine "Mao said the same thing "You must allow people to self-govern and regulate "Indeed
Madluphuthu,@Thabo Matlhabe we will know of those decisions once the commission has completed its business. "I don't think the argument is based on whether or not the nuclear deal was going to benefit the country
sizwe gwala,Are you listening to Nene. He refused to sign a letter to the Russian authorities that SA would not have to pay for the nuclear deal. What was the problem mos? Nene refused to sign the Nuclear deal. How does this prove that Guptas captured the state?
Manase More,..
Andrew Mc Farlane,Marxism misses a few things. One thing I remember from a scholar of Marxism is that is lacks morals and ethics. The evidence thereof is the 50 million murdered by Stalin And others
