Whereas he told exactly what you has shared in that meeting present but Manuel mixed names Who is that person? Nowonder isn’t Bathabile Dlamini? "Now Mbalula is giving former President to runaway by saying he didn’t share the news What else did you discuss sir Mbaks? Eating make you dizzy That curry makes you do favors and sympathy for Gupta Kill the cut Razz matazz don’t be scared 😱 Curry is a problematic to ministers and politicians Mbalula always praise Eff on Twitter "Fact remains you hear b4 you called by President broke the news sir to you Mr Mbalula you are not giving correct answer If you miss opportunity to clarify clouds will hangout soon to your head Mbalula cracking now 😃😃😃 Connect the dots Mbalula please is obviously you are appointed by Gupta "Mveli Zimase it the head we are talking about his friends whom now know where to be found and Mbalula failed to arrest them while were here escaped with Duduzane Mbalula is conflicted with his evidence Told b4 you have been told by President simply you have appointed by Guptas "As I said b4 Mbalula is dropping the opportunity to put meaningful remarks here but failed to say he feels like he was appointed by Guptas besides the president He is trying to block the truth come out of his chest Mr Mr Mbalula there is voice transcription record saying that How can you speak out and then backtrack Agreed Mbalula Just agree that you were appointed by Guptas You are failing me sir Mbaks now you were appointed in advance "Very rarely Mbalula "Miss Gcabashe caught him big time "Thando Nkutha zondo done nothing wrong but Mbalula failed to connect the dots just saying according what Ajay told me b4 president happened exactly "Mbalula must just admit that he was appointed by Guptas b4 president made officials announcement to you Mbalula Bring it on miss Gcabashe 😃😃😃 He wanted to sell the Anc and country to the hands of Guptas by assistant appointing Dlamini Zuma as president of ANC 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ answer correctly sir Mbaks please I am Anc member but what Mbalula tackling is not helping us defied "Mbalula is tired now Mbalula please don’t tweet again tjoo Alright tell us about R300 000 trip why was paid to by different banks please no more vocal people please make sense to the nation "In terms of being appointed by President Mbalula counsel asked his employer I assumed he will give wrong answer again Hang on there mr Mbalula "Kahle bo  Counsel please send sms what answer you want please now is cracked more and more "I think he supposed to read evidence b4 him two weeks before he came here not wat he knew which contradicts himself Change your stance Mbalula please what you give us is exactly true that Guptas appoints you b4 president I think he is the last witness Did he made mathematical and science?

pierre djamba,what is this the man is down yes yes yes in tears can this lady stop? let go for eff i am voting eff we all will go for eff
Magda Seguin,Sound? @Makhosi I just read about it ...a Range Rover costing nearly R3m!! He said that Zuma helped the DA grow He thinks South Africans have short memories Yes he did...in a press conference moral.. The video is online Body language... @goolamv...he supported Zuma very vociferously....remember? Also very arrogant in Parliament @goolamv...you are too kind to people who destroyed the country Your choice ...The looters don't deserve any support The problem with the ANC is that they think they are still a liberation movement and not a democratic government accountable to the people We know Trevors side of the story...let's hear what he said Totally distracting @Sindiswa Moolman He changed his coat after Zuma left Thank you Chairman...Trevor talked without reading But Trevor said you told them that the Guptas told you before you were appointed Why didn't you refuse when Zuma appointed you Mr Mbablula? He never challenged Zuma about it and voted nine times against no confidence... No...he didn't...@Bridgette...revisit the YT video Trevor Manuel told exactly what happened I the meeting and Mbablula even tweeted to thank him Everybody confused the Gupta names...only those who knew them well can distinguish What happened to Mrs Phiyega? He said the Gupta congratulated him!!! Now he blames the media...typical ANC tactic Ouch...The New Age!! that rag that stole taxpayers money Totally spinning like a top Thank you Chairman...I heard it too..Yirre this guy can lie Raising his voice @goolamv...you trust ANC NEC minutes??? Half of the old NEC are still there @Epnet I think the Chaiman picked it up already...that is why he is explaining now @Peter I have enormous respect for Judge Zondo Why not? The Pres is a servant of the people "Political salaries are too big to lose it seems...bodyguards...houses But the meeting ended and Zuma said absolutely NOTHING...didn't even react! He was....didn't you hear Manuels testimony Zuma was there and nobody questioned him...revisit the YT video of Manuals testimony...it is online He knew exactly what was happening with the Guptas and Zuma...contradicting himself again Yet the ANC still carried on with the Guptas @goolamv...I ask myself the same question...He is trying to spin his involvement Yes @John Fagan..He was ANCYL leader and received money from Kebble Barry Sargent wrote the book...I still have it in my library That has been alluded to but not proven NOT the EFF...Thuli Madonsela...the EFF had it in for Zuma and used her report Hundreds of people were interviewed by Thuli after confidential complaints by citizens.. The entire ANC was captured...they voted 9 times to keep Zuma Eskom had ten CEO's in nine years... So resigning and blowing the whistle was not an option? The banks acted autonomously...The government has no say in closing bank accounts.He made a mistake there as they were probably discussing after the banks closed the Gupta accounts His testimony is full of holes and not convincing He makes himself out to be a hero The Judge must know everything for his report and final recommendations @Allan Tshuma "I would like to hear about the Dubai meeting he attended where Joemat-Pettersen "The Judge presides over this Commission The Guptas must come out of hiding and tell their stories here and be cross examined as well The Saxonwold shebeen and restaurant was popular among ANC cadres Speculation and obfuscating...getting himself deeper in trouble even going sovfar as to find ing excuses for the NEC! 'benefit of the doubt'..Eish The Judge must clarify...he is right in asking probing questions Zuma must hace told the Guptas what happebed in the NEC meeting So he lied to the Public Protector I said before that I don't trust him...He cannot try now to cover up lying Let me repeat: when you tell the truth you never have to remember lies @Michael Gumede...hostile witness He was covering up for Zuma in his interview with the PP....never thought he will have to answer one day He should just own up like other witnesses did...He has no integrity @Michael Gumede...spot on Own up please @thabang it's getting hot Zuma maintains he did nothing wrong I am starting not to believe all his stories Zuma sold the country to the Guptas nothing will change that fact Sjoe...we are ruled by monsters @thabang your sense of humour is very refreshing under these horrid circumstances...you should be a writer Vas gepraat boet! Don't do that...you are trying to get in deeper Mr Mbablula True @Bonang Sithole The ANC vilified the PP on every corner He is still ducking...I rest my case The advocate had enough...I knew it when she mentioned 'technicalities' Liars always do this.....autocorrecting so that their lies appear like the truth but it's clear as daylight that he has no integrity Judge is trying to let him confess a d own that he lied for Zuma Haibo Judge...He was fully aware! The PP asked straightforward questions...now he is blaming her questioning...down the abyss we go... People who do not recognise their shortcomings and faults are narcissistic @Sabelo Dlamini are you in denial of state capture? "Fact remains he said ""NO"" when the PP asked him if the Guptas told him he will be appointed Minister....semantics" 'Issue of perceptions'....the PP had a hard time Deny EMPHATICALLY he said He needs a holiday in Dubai Complained a year later Arrogance towards the PP...accountable to the people of SA sucker!..NOT the ANC! Pride comes before a fall The ANC are only accountable to the party @Sabelo Dlamini...now I am sure you are in denial of state capture The Guptas called Zuma ' The old man' they called the shots and appointed ministers Eleven cabinet reshuffle in 9 years always in the dead of night Cry the beloved country He must specify that it was the NEW AGE...a government sponsored rag Judge...He was protecting Zuma.He told the PP he is only accountable to the ANC "The ANC had no respect for the PP  Adv Thuli Madonsela is an icon of respect and integrity Accused???...mind the words Mr Mbablula Ms Gcabashe is very thorough @whitepope we don't need philosophy lectures Yet you consisted with the Guptas...and supported Zuma. Your comrades so not be happy that you call them cowards "@whitepope stop preaching we are all educated This is the first time that lunch will be late Blocked whitepope @Cerebis selling philosophical theories on power Very irritating @Cerebis...He is on the wrong forum.At least he is not rude or obnoxious Throwing Zuma and his comrades under the bus If you came clean we would have respected what you are saying right now but it's too late...sorry Eskom...The Rogue Unit never existed...the Sunday Times was implicated and taken for a ride by Moyane.They even lost an award which was rescinded this week.Stop talking about a fictitious 'rogue unit'
Themba Makhubo,poor sound fix it i wanna Mbaks crying
Jim Connolly,He’s probably in tears already😂
Peter Lukas,"Oooo yes course the anc rule alone
Indoda Yamaqiniso,"So Is his hair your sexual fantasy? And they give us the lowest resolution 360p as a compulsory😡😠 "He also said he wasn't appointed by the Guptas "Pierre The background noise😖 Fikile as opposed to Fikele. The body language when you're about to lie knowing that you later will be exposed. He's wobbling He wobbles like a planet on it's axes against the Moon(s) gravitational pull. "People don't vote you into power Power is for Kings and Queens. "Sipho Mkhize We're we we we we're we we... "He's so unstable That's what happens when your conscience knows you are lying or about to lie. Brett Kebble's booty-call lady. Is this @Siyabonga Dlala I know? "Well He's trying to align truth with lies. Julius Malema also on Tweeter congratulated Stella Ndabeni for her appointment before it was announced and before everybody else knew. Is that a state capture? Zuma will destroy sorry people's lives when time comes. Even Mbalula knows it. This would never link to Zuma because he'd say he doesn't know anything about and as it stands there is no proof that it has anything to do with him. I know you've seen it😋🤭 How could he tell that it was Ajay Gupta calling? When you lie you make so many hiccups on one statement... 🤔 Exactly!! @peter pott. Today they'd go around saying they didn't support Apartheid when it made them and still defending what they benefited from Apartheid and by Apartheid. This guy is so tainted. It's well known that he's in Johann Rupert's pockets "Mbalula The Chair has suddenly retired the evidence leader🤔. This commission is an act🤔🤔🤔 It has motives "The water bottle needs Jesus It seems like Zondo himself is captured "He raises eyebrows on how he handles witnesses differently to fish for more into the stories. He didn't do this on Mzwanele Manyi "The Guptas launched a scathing campaign against Mbalula and couldn't get him fired Repeating the same thing over and over again. Liaaaaarrrr!!!! "They thought coming to the commission woulf be easy. Zuma will always walk them over He's weak weak weak...!! Yerrrr!!! 🤦🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️ "Zuma's lawyers will equalize on this He has already allowed water to get into his chamber and he's already wet. 🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️ It's hot 🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️ Konakele!!! Zondo is so soft like a pastor.
xolisile mbejeni,i happy is starting his powers are in those hair zondo must keep quiet pls they must stop now today sonele ngamaga
Gabriel Ngulube,look at his hair he is lying clever looks stupid now saved by the bell damage control
Khaya Nomoyi,He once said ANC members in Parliament who voted against Zuma are sellouts. The judge in a way is helping the evidence leader by asking these relevant questions to get clearity from Mbalula.
Peter Maregere,She is taking too long loadshading now now

Eslon Eslon,How wish it was advocate Maleka SC to deal with Mbalula He isn't looking like the energetic Mbalula we know "Soon that glass of water next to him will be hit to the ground Can't they move that water bottle away from him did he rubbish what Trevor Manuel testified as false? Oops! Trevor Manuel lied So Trevor Manuel never lied but confuse names? He's now spinning Plz move the water bottle away he's collaborating Trevor Manuel's testimony ANC undergrounds leak it to the media Name plz Mr. Mbalula But he's contradicting himself at one point he said no one confronted him Guys plz pay attention he said no one questioned He started well until he contradict himself "@Unathi Sulani "Thando my guess it can be one of the following magoons: 1 Ace Magashule 2 Supra 3 Sikhile Zikalala 4 Collin Maine "@Mzalwane @Solly 12... He haven't name him yet Plz keep quite Mr. Chair sound is sucking he's being evasive with questions now The madam is slowly closing on him now But Zondo also! Mr. Chair plz relax let the evidence leader do her job unhindered Chair is now hindering evidence leader Am fed up that Zondo prevented evidence leader from going to the critical area that would have given us an idea where Guptas got the ANC confidential information I'm only interested in knowing how did the got to know that Mbalula was going to be sports minister. evidence leader was enroute there just to be stopped by Zondo "I'm not happy with Zondo Only if the Zondo could allow evidence leader space and time to flow "He's caught pants down it's scrapping and spinning time He's cracking He's spinning things again he lied to PP that he never had a conversation with Guptas Politicians will never tell the truth verbatim True he was never of assistance to the public protector loud mouth never always speak the truth He's going in circles now Every time the lady is giving Mbaks the rope to hang himself more and more "@Cerebis lies has a way of catching up its owners "the lady is frying Mbalula alive Does he has anywhere to hide as of now? Zondo is smart he want Mbaks to conceit to his lies who's this guy? Goodnes! even his lawyer is confused not to realize he's inflicting more harm on him with his questions This lawyer is not helping Mbalula at all but dragg him into trouble "@Thando Nkutha
lucky Molepo,lol Zondo must take a chill English picking up now vuvuzela now ...so unnecessaru now Mbalula is being extra no more Bujwazeee Drama yes u can see him on his pam dark and lovely moistures Trevor Manuels Vs Mbalula the chair want the juicy details @Indoda Yamaqiniso focus all of us we knew it heheheheheheh heeeeeee Compound can Zondo allow this beautiful advocate to ask questions the chair doesnt allow the advocate to interrogate @SABC Digital News noted Zondo need to relax yazi women are capable as advocate Zondo will defend him lies lies lies Jonas Lied to public protector now Mbalula @Mzalwane Mzala he must say it "Jonas the chair trying to assist the liar wow frame of the mind hahahahahah The chair want to give him time for his lies

Albert Noah,One really wonders if State Capture could occur to such an extent in Constitutional democracy where elections are held every five years....happens to countries where no elections are held...... This seating was always going to be a hot potato that the DCJ is virtually taking over...... Mbaks is just showing that THE President is all powerful in the NEC Maybe the Commission could have handle Mbaks' eveidence differently I thought his explanation sets him free
Myka'Al Daud,😂😂😂 "Remember he is EFF in heart EFF is where i put my cross come 8th of May I voted ANC since but now I want fresh air n change n EFF I choose this time.

Mzalwane Mzala,😀😀😀Mbaks never expected this analysis of his fashion sense. You guys are nasty 😁😁 He agrees with Trevor @Eslon Eslon Speak up ANC NEC member Mbalula @ayanda hlongwane Ramaphosa was in business Kgalema was the deputy president The only guilty person is that one member who rubbished Mbalula's statement Malema was in that meeting Julius Malema also kept quiet There is no contradiction It had to be one of the staunches supporters of the president. @K-bee Mablack Moalosi Please be truthful. That was in the first 5 years of Zuma and Malema was the lead protector. When he insulted Khwezi. He coud have been the one insulting Mbalula. @Ngema N.E The president and secretary of the youth/ women and veterans league sit in the NEC Julius Malema only publicised it as a tool when he was out of the ANC. It could be someone who said he would die for president Zuma. Malem @K-bee Mablack Moalosi This was in a NEC meeting This happened way before Mangaung and Mbalula subsequently stood for elections against Zuma and Mantashe slate at Mangaung @Sipho You are not disputing that Malema kept quiet in that meeting The language of NEC not being a sheeben sounds like a youger person @Vusi Mbambiso I can not rule out Supra Stop lies. Mbalula became a Minister of Sport in 2010. That is two years before Mangaung. 2010 @Desmond Maripane In 2012 already he challenged the Zuma slate and stood with Kgalema in Mangaung. He raised this matter in August 2011. @Eslon Eslon Add Julius Malema to that list @goolamv His evidence is that they fell out after he raised this in the NEC and we now know that was in August 2011. Where is the lie? @Sipho Do you now get that this was raised in August 2011? Mbalula's testimony strengthens the one of Mcebisi Jonas. "After the discredidting of Vytjie's testimony ANC voters are sobber @Petrus Kitsiso Notice Rabotlhale Vytjie never said that Manuel was being crazy on the one of qualities to be a sport minister. @Petrus Kitsiso Notice Rabotlhale It had nothing to do with Mbalula. Vytjie says she refused an offer of being made a minister to discontinue SAA' India line Yes Ramaphosa is making changes It is possible that Mbalula was still protecting his benefactor when he went before the Public Protector Trying to protect the former president will haunt many people who are trying to clear themselves now. People like Jonas stuck to their story both before the Public Protector and this commission. He must just say he misunderstood the public protector. Appointed vs congratulated He must not spin and just said I might have misunderstood. Otherwise he will be digging a hole for himself. There is no testimony under oath when you meet the public protector. He might just avoid this @em D Under oath is when you are before a court or a judicial enquiry/ commission. @em D To be under oath you must take an oath like it happened in this commision or in a court of law Mbalula must just say he misunderstood the public protector.

roberto wilco,His a bit of a wild card I like this guy The Guptas like Cricket
K-bee Mablack Moalosi,The friend he was with is the CIC Julius Malema Who is that comrade? Julius was already in trouble with the anc leadership at that time Mzalwane. Mzalwane you are misinformed. This issue happened here in Mangaung during the elective conference that kicked Kgalema Motlanthe out and Cyril became dp. Malema was already in conflict with Zuma. He was already subjected to the D.C. You are correct Mzalwane. The EC meeting that they held in Mangaung just before the conference.
Mkhuseli Mase,"Mbaks says he said heeee
Wonga Masiza,Mbalula's glasses though 😂😁😀 Butterfly glasses 😁😂 "@siyanda sibiya it seems like you are easily distracted...best thing you could do is ""Hide Chat"". Thina simamele "'Snitch"" 😂😁" Mbalula is lying on this question...look at hs face He is not comfortable with this question 😁😂 "Ask the question again in a different way The advocate is averse to Mbalula...Mbalula feels more comfortable with Zondo 😁😂 "We have witnessed Mbalula shaking in the past 10 minutes Hahahah the questions are getting more interesting @carnoth ngomane there are no proZuma people here...this is not an ANC rally....we are not proANC here Mbalula takes his glasses off 😀 @whitepope5 You follow Jordan peterson..Lol

Andre Gerber,the glasses goes with the new hairstyle the ANC knew everything Zuma went to the Guptas after every NEC meeting mmmmmm Mr. Fear F..kall. What now he only wants to testify on what he said in the NEC meeting. Did not expect them to bring in PP report
Epnet Streaming,How did the Gupta have this guys phone number?
MAFU NDIKI,there is no need for ANC minuets for that particular meeting unless there is someone whom is against what Mbalula is saying. Siyanda you are quite correct but there is no contradiction here the issue was not discussed instead he was rubbished by a certain NEC member. there is no contradiction here Julius kept quite in the NEC meeting when this was raised by Fikile. so he should have never ever spoken since he spoke late
Vusumzi Ngcoza,@siyanda sibiya exactly @siyanda sibiya i still see nothing wrong to what you said.
Malakia Matheus,Mr. Mbalula is carefull with his words today.

Esethu Mzimkulu,😀😀😀😀😂😂😂
Zama Timbela,Haybo Mbaaks you young Mbalula a Gupta minister
Vusi Mbambiso,Mbambula is contradicting himself. He just said one NEC member rose and rubbished him. Tell us who rubbished what you said. I suspect Nathi Mthethwa rubbished what he said. The Commission Chair could not hold himself. He must give Ms Gacabshe a chance to lead the evidence! Supra Mahumapelo rubbished what he said! It is true the whole ANC NEC was captured. How can they ignore what Mbalula said! "Moira T He took a very long time to raise this issue and still cried like a baby! He must have been under pressure to award the Guptas some sport contract! Justice Zondo is excited like a child in a sweet shop! The evidence leader felt excluded and hinted to that to the judge! I hope the evidence leader can ask some probing questions now without the Chair's interference! Talk my Lady! @Solly it is either Supra or Ace! "Solly The Judge is distracting the evidence leader! I am starting to be suspicious! He never raised it anywhere again! He enjoyed his ministerial salary! "In fact Where did Ajay get his cell number? He is lying! "He did not say 'Hee!"" to Ajay!" There goes the judge again..! Ajay Gupta was 6th member of the Top 6! He went to Sahara computers! This curry topic is a distraction! He must stop being emotional! It is either lied to the Public Protector or he is lying here! "Now Contradictions cannot be covered. A fudge is being done in front of our eyes..! Hahhahahah! "Lies A couple of lies to the Public Protector! 🙄🙄🙄 The commission realises that he is lying here or lied to the Public Protector!\ He does not want to say he lied to the Public Protector!
justice .nefale,How is he contradicting himself? Mbalula trying to distance himself from the Guptas

"I think where Mbaks went wrong was in not asking Ajay questions when he congratulated him. He shouldn't have just said ""hee"" and dropped the phone. He should've asked how Ajay knew"
Takalani Luthada,h
Bevil Carey,ja
Gary Maddison,Mbalula is showing signs of empty vessel syndrome.

Dominic Przybylski,No individual responsibility is accepted. Socialists don't believe in it. Their excuse is collective responsibility i.e. individuals get off scot free no matter what they do. This guy was minister of police after sport and did nothing about state capture. All ANC MPs ignored their oath. @whitepope5 You may be very interested in what you are saying but this is not the right place to give a philosophical lecture. @Thando Nkutha I'm a South African. If you think skin colour has anything to do with this I have to disagree.
