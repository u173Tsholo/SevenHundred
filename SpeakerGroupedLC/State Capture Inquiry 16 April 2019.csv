Nhlanhla Nsele,morning bathandi bezindaba if u were Moyane i would just file a new affidavit with proper facts and ask to come to the commission and give evidence...that will lure Gordhan to ask to cross exermine
Allan 28,"Hallo Pravin must Be cross examined just like everyone "‚ÄãPravin does not want to be questioned by public protector Just get to the verdict chief @Amanda Watson Interrogating is what is being sought to be archived but Pravin does not want that This then means no one must be cross examined "@welton paulse yes so why should others be cross examined and Pravin not?

funicanz,"Morning So.. Pravin doesn't want his version to be cross examined? We must just believe his version as it stands. "@Amanda Watson  "@Eslon Eslon  And they will use Adv. Mxolisi Zondo to discerdit DCJ. "Should Chair deny this application üèÉüèÉ "@Magda Seguin  I see a deny here. "@Magda Seguin ... let's leave it there. We might just find ourselves blocked "@Quintin Jacobs  "My assumption Time wasted. "@Magda Seguin  "For as long as we won't entertain those who won't agree with the judgement and encourage the commission to move on @Wandile Wiseprince üòÜ "@Magda Seguin  We know who follow this commission religiously and we skip their comments due to those that feels this is a playground. "@Thando Nkutha  "@Amanda Watson  DCJ has been reading for more than an hour. "They will go for a short adjournment Public Protector Yhooo!!!! DENIED I smell a press conference to remove DCJ coming in a few hours.... @Magda Seguin üòÜüòÜ 90 minutes to be exact. He needs sugar. When are they coming back? "So when Adv.

Imagine "McBride's evidence is complicated Why adjourn if you will take a long adjournment at 13:00?
Eslon Eslon,"Moyane will be granted to the approval The issue is not that Gordan refuse to be cross examined but that Dali Mpofu want to bring issue rogue unit which was not part of the Pravin evidence The truth is that Dali want to use the commission to bring the Rogue unit and discredit Pravin evidence "@carnoth Mark my word the eff will noise if Zondo refuse to grant the cross examination Guys remember the eff was here the day Pravin appeared and attack the commission Moyane was suppose to first present his version to the commission b4 applying to cross examine Pravin "@Sindiswa mzalwane Malema and the eff will be paranoid if this application fail Jerrrr this long verdict Zondo is clumbing on Mpofu heavily now Moyane and Mpofu must understand that the commission is about law and facts not emotions "I remember the day the eff were here when PG appeared "I'm not a PG supporter but Tom Moyane "@Magda Seguin That name Paul O'suluvain "@Magda Seguin @Nhlanhla.. Tom Moyane won't do that bcoz he will expose his skelanyana skeletons when are we expecting the eff press conference to attack and accuse the commission of protecting Pravin and his cabals "@Magda Seguin... Please don't laugh @Robert Russell... What do u mean by spy vs spy? why do I feel like Mcbride's testimony needs a higher arena than this commission? "Mcbride's evidence is highly complicated that it needs a bench of few judges to ventilate it not only Zondo and Pretorius Patronage is a strong word to use Plz proof the patronage you're referring to Mr. Mcbride "I can't imagine that DCJ Zondo has to sit analyze "@carnoth ngomane... Imagine Zondo has to sit alone analyze This commission was suppose to have two three judges along side Zondo plus evidence leaders to exact more infos from witnesses instead of two people exploring facts from witnesses Mcbride is somehow intelligent There's come the Mxolosi Zondo story now
Netshivhera Tman Wa Gaba,morning ..praving must fall
carnoth ngomane,"why doesnt he want to be cross examined he cant say things about people and expect it to take it as it is @makhosi nobhatyi you maybe right but if gordan is certain his evidence is correct why doesnt he want it to be tested @Pheladi Lamola i agree with you @makhosi nobhatyi i fully agree with you but it doesnt mean Gordaan shouldnt be cross examined "@makhosi nobhatyi Ghordan implicated moyane on his testimony and he should be cross examined @Eslon Eslon if Ghordan's testimony if legit there is no way in which they will discredit it. My question is why doesnt he want to be cross examined? if Ghordan's testimony is credible then it should be open for cross examination. @Eslon Eslon thats true but it doesnt mean Ghordan mustn't be cross examined "I think there's more in Mcbride's evidence and it needs a thorough examination "@i feel so because whenever Mcbride bring up sme juicy topic Pretorius will often say it will be discussed in due cos @Eslon Eslon its already a huge task @David Hotz i know all that but energy thereof is lacking and some evidence from are left hanging with further questions "@Ndim Mavuks to some people ANC is a phobia
Bophelo Malapela,So Mayane being granted leave to cross examine is political agenda? Those asking why PG does not want to be cross-examined or impugning the credibility of the commission are not paying attention to the judgment being delivered by DCJ Zondo because it is boring "Granting leave to cross-examine where warranted is not giving in to childish fights Judgment written in the same stellenboch where Floyd shivhambu went to look for business partners?
Tarisai Kadungure,Cross examination its about testing the evidence provided by a witness . The witness must therefore not fear anything if their evidence is true
sikhumbuzo crispen sibanda,kkkkk Tom must come before the commision before with his evidance before cross examing any one kkkk
Nelson Musoliwa,Justice must take its course for Fairness to all Justice account to law not to individuals or political parties so justice must prevail in this particular instance. So whether Pravin is cross examined or not it must be by the law nothing more nothing less A knowledgeable law practitioner would know how broad the defectives are in an application for leave to cross examined a witness to avoid clutching on a straw. CIS and IPID were ate each other's throat instead of providing services to the nation which is tantamount to treason. @Elson i concur with u this testimonies is highly complicated @Norman you can say that again this is one of the major causes that collapsed the state The rot in state was too deep as Robert is explaining here
Pheladi Lamola,I'm not sure about fighting for Malema but I want Pravin to be cross-examined. He can't just give his version and go on his merry way. The Commission must be seen to be fair to everyone. @Tarisai Kadungure Agreed.
Magda Seguin,Last night was really devastating with the Notre Dame fire "But friends Moyane destroyed SARS..the Nugent Commission was clear "The do called 'rogue unit' never existed.The EFF is fuelling this against Gordhan Moyane fought time and again to stay relevant...he is heavily implicated in state capture "No He even sent his lawyers to testify for him at the Nugent commission Dali Mpofu came across very unprofessional at the Commission here..revisit it on YouTube. Today a SARS employee is facing disciplinary who gave the Guptas R460m VAT return ordered by Moyane..she will probably lose her job too.The payments were made via third parties What lies? "The EFF will use Judge Zondo's brother excuse if it is denied @Funicanz Exactly "I am extremely concerned about the EFF @Amanda he didn't answer my question...it does Malema is a dictator in the making @funicanz what about the militarization of the EFF? It reminds me of Idi Amin They may even invade the venue that's their style I always remind people that Malema was 12 years old when Masina was released from prison.His mentor was Peter Mokaba of 'kill the Boer fame *Madiba @funicanz you are right Mpofu is a member of the EFF executive @funicanz yes... Moyane is running from court to court and commission to commission wasting our time @Bophelo Malapela true "as a lawyer one can't keep defending hopeless cases Must I spell it out? SARS @Keatlarese @Bothell spot on @Keatlareste if you dint know SARS you must be a cyberbot Blocking a few people who trigger nonsense Thanks @funicanz The race card....when all else fails Mzilikazi Wa Afrika must have nightmares for falling for the 'rogue unit' scam...he was used to publish hogwash which brought the Sunday Times into disrepute.The Cato Manor story too. Moyane never opens his mouth...he uses his lawyers to speak for him hence Mpofu will do the bidding for him We are still waiting for the PP to produce the outcome of Estina Dairy invedtigation "Eish Moyane is pathetic "Yes but we all know the Estina report is biased "Shivambu brother Brian is trouble to the amount of R5.5m he borrowed from VBS I for one have no trust in the PP She does not represent the public...why is she also hunting down Gordhan? She wants to question Gordhan on the old 27 questions that the NPA sent to him after he was sacked by Zuma The EFF always knows beforehand what is happening inside the ANC and even makes it public before the ANC announces it Confirmed and the indisputable evidence? See my above explanation Eish I'm tired...the Notre Dame burnt last night it was terrible "Very thorough and exact Thank you Judge @Sindiswa correct.Mabuza and Ace territory @goolamv...yet the EFF are instigating communities to invade land in Gauteng I blocked him ages ago "Judge will need a long holiday Reserved @makhosi the ANC had 24 plus years to run Joburg....instead they stole the R1.7 billion "Sewerage doesn't spill into streets one day to the next...and remember Esidimeni? I lived in Joburg for 11 years until recently...potholes No...it's not a waste...only to those who do not understand policy and procedure Yes the ANC government should have resigned when Agrizzi provided tapes... They want another 25 years to rob the treasury...Ace wants to have the treasury nationalised Am I missing something? just read on Twitter state capture account that the cross exam was dismissed Thanks @Madelein Excellent @Eslon Eslon I was away for a minute "Read the analysis in the Daily Maverick...McBride opened a Pandoras box of corrupt *deceipt "Paul O'Sullivan did great work @Robert Russell they arrested both him and his assistant on false charges...they are desperate to jail and denigrate him "@Eslon Eslon long story Yes I saw it too @Robert Russell The ANC stole the future of the generation who was born in 1994...They only saw corruption in their lifetime And bribery is rife Cele made SAPS a quasi military outfit when he was police minister the first time now we have 'general's who never fought in a war "@Sibonakaliso Gumede we should never lose hope @Eslon EslonüòÑ We have recent examples of how people made a change peacefully: Sudan and Algeria @David Hotz I blocked Thando Nkutha ages ago I know @Eslon Eslon point taken "The detail of McBride' s testimony is phenomenal I wish I kept my MAD magazines from my younger days @Robert Russell @Eslon Eslon I agree I hope Shamila Batohi start the prosecutions with this section of the commission...she has huge interest in cleaning out her backyard Goodness!Israel? They have the most sophisticated spyware...the new phone spying device cost millions.The Saudi government used it on Kashoggi The Saudis spied on Kashoggi and his whereabouts and consequently killed him brutally in the Turkish Saudi embassy. SAPS should do away with military nomenclature...they are servants of the people not the army Zuma shuffled his government on a regular basis...always at night.I think it was 9 or 11 times...every time someone new came in things were changed.The newcomers were Gupta state capture choices Brilliantly explained by McBride @nyiko nyiko thanks He has already been made Head of the Parliamentary Integrity Committee by CR...if the Zuma faction get rid of CR we are again in the same boat @David Hotz Exactly What an indictment on Zuma government!! All the decisions were made at the Gupta shebeen @Thami there was no line..just party interest So many names implicated @Thami the last time I looked the ANC is the governing party and they have the majority vote.Time and again the opposition parties complained the the ANC executive has no accountability. "The ANC is the national government overall The ANC other AGAINST no confidence I Zuma NINE times...they ruined the country with their looting

Aniceth De Missamou,"The rule says for you to cross examine any witness Did Moyane give a statement for him to want to cross examine Pravin? "Without any statement from Tom "The Gupta tried the same thing "@Elson Moyane has not given his version and yet waist money on applying for Leave to Cross Examine a witness. He must have a lot of cash to throw around? @Magda Seguin the lawyer is making money. Who is footing the bills for TM's lawyer? He doing a botched job. A great lawyer would've have advised his client not to pursue a non winnable case
Gugulethu Dube,Moyane in his bid to cross examine Gordhan also raises new questions which were never alleged at the commission but at different points in his interraction with Gordhan "This is a serious take down of Adv Mpofu

Jacob John,I think most people fail 2 distinguish Mpofu as an advocate nd Eff chairperson. Its very premature to try nd link Mpofu's profession nd EFF.I believe he doesn't get any mandate from EFF on this case.
Cerebis,Again gained Huge respect for the DCJ. He is a just man and our Country needs more like him. @makhosi nobhatyi Great comment! Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi in 1993 gave a speech that stretched over 11 days!! Hope the DCJ is not trying to better that??
Chris Welensky,@funicanz unfortunately that's exactly what McBride did the past few days
Derek Main,@Quintin Jacobs Give us one example. @Maanda Manyatshe Yes but the ANC has made it a s**thole. @Musa Bakiti Careful what you wish for - you might get it. @Thando Nkutha McBride exposed that certain people who were dealing with serious cases were gotten rid of illegally and were bribed to give false testimony. @Thando Nkutha I personally think McBride wanted to use the opportunity to air his grievances but there was some worthwhile testimony. "@Thando Nkutha If you missed yesterday's evidence @For Ever Young I don't see Magda Seguin comments. She is too hysterical so I blocked her. @Thando Nkutha Then I'm not sure how you can assert that McBride's evidence is useless. You didn't see the crux of it. @Thando Nkutha who? what? how? That must have been the part you missed. @Thando Nkutha I simply don't remember the names and details. I'm old - forgive my memory. You could always watch yesterday's evidence if you want to. It's all there. @funicanz Too true - from top to bottom. @Thando Nkutha They were definitely mentioned yesterday. I just can't be bothered to listen to it again - but you can if you want the details. @Thando Nkutha @Musa Bakiti Thanks for the compliments guys - I'm flattered. @Musa Bakiti You're a real joker ü§£ @Sibonakaliso Gumede Unfortunately not much debating happens at parliament - it's a circus. @Thando Nkutha Hey! I'm doing all of those so I must be alright. üòÉ @Michael Wild I'd go for chopping off a hand. "@Eslon Eslon The word ""patronage"" is not strong enough for what's happened here - it's outright criminality." @Ndim Mavuks Take a look at how your glorious movement treats anyone with integrity eg. McBride. The ANC is now a cabal of criminals. @Ndim Mavuks His evidence here is laying bare how the ANC cadres treated him. @Thami Ngwenya That we have yet to find out. But there was no protection for him from the ANC either. @Thando Nkutha I agree with that but it's not an either-or.

Bonga Nkabinde,.
David Mlilwana,I think ANC will redeem itself and bring about a completely different government that will be approved by all walks of life.The real change is coming for a better SA under the President Ramaphosa
Robert Russell,The moral compass of the ANC is corrupt... no matter who the leader is there is no hope for SA under a ANC Government. @David Mlilwana By dragging him off a flight for having two passports.... how pathetic @Magda Seguin That was chucked out of court and I hear he is suing the Minster of Police for wrongful arrest @Magda Seguin @David Hotz .... it's not horrendous.... it's TREASON This is like Spy vs Spy in the MAD magazine üòÉ Yeah they were really great Magda I should have done the same In the land of the blind.... the cyclops is king.... sounds like you and the ANC.... @Ndim Mavuks
rosalind gerber,I personally have a renewed respect for Mcbride.
For Ever Young,agree wit@Magda Seguin so people in the chat are failing to to read McBride and what he is telling the Commission. He opened the pandora box
Wildthing,millions in bad purchasing. and then the cover up and moving of staff to keep it quiet and who knowns what else. maybe some people are 6ft under. the removal of Paul from a flight and so on. due to all this corruption we have less police on the street to protect and enforce law. "it's time to set very high jail time for any corruption. no matter who or heads all very high ranked officers. first question is how did they get all the high ranks. its handed out like smarties nowadays. The Smarties handed out Time to review all ranks and how they got them "Ndim do you always need to bring back the past. this is related to bad management
Daniel Prinsloo,Anyone remember MAGOO'S @Bas - the entire government is a joke
Desmond Masilela,I'm just bored eish.... I dont have energy to listen to this guy. His been long since his sited here.

Dams daily motivations Madamalala,lets grow SA 2gather its has been a sad story to our young generation Deep rot happened
David Hotz,This evidence is truly nasueauting and shocking. shameful. the planned desttrucion of the law enfocrement servics is horrendous @Thando Nkutha there is no point in engaing with yoiiu. I can see your thread. you have come to dissemble. Your comments i can see add nothing but to obfuscate and prevaricate. pathetic. @Norman Zwane not wished for... actively planned and exectured. M Thamm hightighted some evidence yesterday. shows th e trends of destruction of enforcement. see her FB thread. @Eslon Eslon he has a supportive investigative team. The evidence being led by pretorius isnot all the infomration that gets considered. I suggest you read the terms of the establ of the commission. "@carnoth ngomane 
Bhuga ZA,i wonder which fool is going 2b arrested after dis commission.....
Ndim Mavuks,"No personal battles "This is how you collapse state institutions for state capture "He has not yet been reimbursed by the state for using his own money in defense of the Republic "McBride "This so refreshing unlike the officers and ministers of the white minority government of apartheid "The outcome was always no one is responsible "African Refugee "The ANC as an organisation never dealt with McBride Let alone the fact McBride never accused the ANC of anything here "Exactly Thando "When De Lille called for an open public disciplinary hearing "And Honour him with everything he did pre and post apartheid Eslon he is intelligent not somehow
