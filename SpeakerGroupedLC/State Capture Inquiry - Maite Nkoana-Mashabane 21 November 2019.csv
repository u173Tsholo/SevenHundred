"@Rob Withers ...Do you remember an episode called ""Infogate"" or a Dr Herschel Rhoodie?" @MSG Rules It is relevant when we talk Corruption holistically and not selectively @Rob Nel I do agree with you @MSG Rules You are absolutely right.

There is few things i think they will show her and she is not gonna answer at all this is warm up yes she is is this Top Billing or state capture commission This is so boring! her brain power is a problem even Zim dollar can be stronger than her brain her husband must turning in his grave beaches he was a very intelligent and ethical person ---he was Ambassador too she will not comback after lunch she is sensing a problem chuene unfortunately yes looks like brains remains an important part of ones body humility is a way of making chair accept her vaqueness is this woman stupid or illiterate or both Bianca Arnold very much so with her brains she must not have firearm licence DJ DJ she is not coming back after lunch President Ramaphosa must reshuffle cabinet this afternoon minister is nevours
David Tuer,Compare this Minister of State with Lord Peter Hain!!!! Competence Yolo- where does that come from? What is racist about my comment?? Are you racist Yolo? Christian W ;- you are right.
Stokstaartje Gaming,Very interesting
Moshoeu Mabusela,Our beloved Minister will tell us that no further action was taken after the DC. ANC has disappointed us enough. we have to demand action now on corruption. Our leaders in Parliament. is a shame i can't listen to this rubbish anymore. tired of this contradictions.

Makgoba Johannes,MAITE STOP BEING STUTTERING
funicanz,"If ""PROTOCOL"" was a PERSON!!!" POST POST POST... Your corruption file is quashed after a year of disciplinary action. WOW!!! She is is not hearing herself bakithi.. "DCJ must be lost now. We are not hearing the famous """"YES"" from him 😆" Zuma must have understood her very well when she made these recommendations. Very well "Yet in this case "I feel for Chair today There was information omitted for Zuma to consider woman. :high five Chair.
Hloniphani Ndlela,lord Hains was telling us we should believe in white man..remember what is going on with Independent media..coffee shop..Eskom CEO..South Africans woke up Elliott Chauke..now WMC is in charge of da country just dance for their tune
Kevin Simon,Why can't she just explain her understanding???? I bet he was never suspended or his pay suspended. Witness leaves me with a sense of unease. Haven't quite put my finger on it yet. DCJ has been through this evidence before and he knows there are gaps that must be exposed. I think there was interference in Koloane's redeployment. So the President gets a list...…. And he flipped off the country. CIC = Criminal In Chief Ah! Prerogative again. So a private individual can be appointed. No problem. How are they screened? So the Netherlands did not vet Koloane? Its the Dutchmans fault again...…... This bull was always coming!!!! Letter does not mention the cloud over this guy's head. That is a sin of omission. Criminal. Deploy that person to a lower level job or fire him. That's what the Private Sector would do. "So despite his history Minister now insulting The Netherlands.!!!!!!!!!!! "Hake Post the sanction you are cleansed!!!!! Not sure DCJ appreciates this witness. She clearly demonstrates what the lack of professionalism looks like. "Clever "Sounds like she is saying The Netherlands did not do their background checks Hope CR gets feedback on this performance. Really poor. So each individual is discussed!!!!! With who? So is she saying ZUMA knew. DJ I want her to say so. This is better than tRump's impeachment inquiry. Love it!
Zukile Mawisa,Stuttering is one of the signs that you are lying Nervousness is another sign that you are lying. Keep them coming guys. "There's no excuse for aiding state capture

How is 10% holding the money. makes no sense. the other normal people work for the money. should the money tree just rain on everybody Lets make up some new words....lets call it BMC. how is possible that elected anc memebers abuses 75% of the countires wealth? ANCMC ANCMC ANCMC stole my taxes now we to pay too much for electicity etc Yes that is how settling works. South Africa was not owned by anyone 300 years ago. the whole world was created this way. get on a boat and sail around and see nice piece of grass. and put a tent #ANCMC Agree fully. Billions can buy millions of houses Unions the stumbling block of progress and self preservation Excuse me Trillions can build millions and create more millions "Yolo..this ""minister"" is not the sharpest tool in the shed" "Pastor..is the last 50 years relevant Pastor..for what is happening now there is no value in beating a dead horse. Thulani the new horse is ANCMC. and it is alive and kicking The hole in her head is where what she sees and hears escapes and bypasses the brain Makwa she cant even remember what she had for breakfast Zukile - don't think she is cautious. she has no clue what she is beign asked when someone of her caliber says..since 1994 then you know she is going to tell a long winded no value story she doenst understand the question so make up lies and stories Brought to you by #ANCMC (monopoly capital) really so you dotn need a brain to be an ambassador as long as you ran around burning and looting before 1994 then you can be an ambassadot *ambassador ha ha the list..if you went to prison Non career diplomats from senior citizens....are you kidding me Zone must feel like someone is drilling him through the skull talking to her exactly she has answered nothing She is repeating herself and not answering.

Accounts Director,Interesting statement by participant at conference the other day made the point that apartheid gave rise to union movements now union movements contribute in escalating unemployment. lets take the view that unions will collapse SAA and SAA close down some entrepreneur will establish an privately owned airline employ new staff and use existing infrastructure . Appointed in position or deployed cadre? She might be highly intelligent playing the dj and commission like puppets she might be trained to bs Her expression as a former ambassador can only confuse the audiences and population of other countries Now the clown in her entertains the DJ Senior citizens or skilled diplomats?

Where? Hopefully Zim "I agree "Jan v Riebeeck "So you not allowed to steal in other countries. OK @Stronger together dont know why hang up with Steenhuizens qualifications.

"Look at the lady with the glasses @ Bianca Arnold LOL I can not suffer this any longer. i am out of here. Will go and listen to my Jack Russell. He speaks well
Rob Withers,"Corruption became mainstream when someone said ""we did not struggle to be poor"""
mandisi ntauzana,Minister with a hole on her head
Sboniso Sabelo,Any company got its lawyers represent the company therefore employees also need their representatives which is the union's I can't see anything in this woman to deserve such big position given to her I hope Anc see this mistake they make when choosing ministers I agree with you Makwa Same WhatsApp group as Zuma Total Embarrassment Madam is pointless Zondo will work hard today to clarify questions Seriously we are a joke to other countries All depends on the ruling party Did she passed matric I wonder🤭 It reminds me of Hlaudi At least we know Zuma learnerd English while he was in jail but here I'm speechless This enquiry is embarassing the ruling party on how they elect Chauke you are polical

Zukile Tshiwula,SHE IS VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT SHE SAYS.
Marcus Mmola,With this poor/lack of self-esteem no wonder we as a country are stagnating. Aren`t we having vibrant people in parliament who can lead this nation to prosperity She is suffering brain drain "thanx to the commission now we know how much our leaders shallow are where does the notion that failed politicians are deployed to ambassadorship come from! what about his misdemeanors!Was he the best! can we all go back to school ..... "only her manicure is worth it its insane .... "no
Francoise Phillips,"She is deeply corrupt and unintelligent She talks a lot of unintelligent nothing. She who disgraced her country. She and the Zuma delegation to Davos did nothing but bank their stolen money in Switzerland on that trip. She thinks she can 'smile' her way out of this. A perfect example of how low the ANC's intellect has sunk. This one could not even get a job as a check out girl in real life. "All the female state capture thieves love showing of their manicures
Molao Peter,is the minister answering the question? "she remembers what happened in1994 but forget what happened in 2013 "eish  and circus also

There's no diplomatic work but shopping. "Only in South Africa "Koloane is found guilty of breaking protocol. Get's suspended She's acting stupid. She can't even make references on the documents.

We are the true South Africans! I wish people would realize that this is what you get when you lower the schooling standards. "@Bianca Arnold Please help spread the word @Zola Pinda lol lol "You must give Hlaudi credit I dont think he even realizes he was used sorry meant to say Hlaudi does not know what he does not know. """All you need it talent""" "All you need is talent""" "If it was ""Hoffman"" she would have been called a racist" lol I think at least from the look on her face she knows what she does not know. @Rob Nel om that iq test joke has me crying "guys its not a waste lol "These people are results of weakness in the system @Paul Buchel lol
