Im thinking Ms Nonkululeko Dlamini got a fast promotion and asked no questions but we shall see... Hes looking nervous... @wim louw Im not a believer in physiognomy but he looks like a nice guy wherever hes from...maybe a yes man tho GIve us the 2 names dude @Siphenkosi Mlandezo Give him a chance...

Nonku Matthews,guys this is not about english... he is trying to tell all however he wants to do so without incriminating himself. he is sticking to one story and he is not going to change his statements to give the chair the answers he needs he didn't forget the question.... they can wrap up now... "who is ""so and so""?" "who is ""so and so"" guys?" ey ya.... see i told you this guy doesn't want to incriminate himself but he is giving them the truth all that Mr Baloyi is giving them is Leads to investigate. Who's this guy asking stupid questions? it's better when the chair is asking questions cos he gets to the route of the information that he needs hehehe he specifically said he won't remember all of them
