Jie Hamilton,BECAUSE HE HATES MY OWN SELF AND THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN POLICE THEN THEY CALL YOU A CRY BABY and stuff. like that and then they drive 45 Minute drive and think you're a spastic being shy inquiry picking aborigines and a lady named Lisa took stuff at birth thank you
HALO,"Hey "BE GONE anc thieves "The world is supposed to be a place of peace The signs are evident. Just look. Think deeply. "Open your eyes All corruption will be eradicated. Blessed are the pure of heart. This life on Earth is a lesson to humanity that when sin thrives there is no peace. Destruction and chaos becomes manifested in such a world where sin is allowed to thrive. Learn this lesson. 2 guys were killed in kzn because they were exposing corruption regarding rdp houses. So be careful when exposing corruption. These people are demonic. Many people use witchcraft. Their judgement will be strict Unholy behaviour can act as a door to bring demons into a person's life Love is the way. The world needs saving The justice system is corrupted This life is a lesson. When you want to disobey The Lord be prepared to deal with the consequences Unfortunately many innocents suffer at the hands of the wicked Dont you know that this world is under the power of the evil ones. Humans have been left to deal with all this chaos. Those who stay dedicated to The Lord are worthy of being accepted and forgiven "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood "Humans are distracted to fight each other when our enemies are those in the spiritual realm "All this stuff is not what really matters Why don't governments help those poverty-stricken and war-torn countries? Yet so much money is spent on materialistic distraction and other nonsense. Where is the support? "Big picture? There is a spiritual war going on. Sin is being made to look attractive so that people don't go to heaven and receive blessings. What matters is being pure There is only one Lord. Just look at the state of the world. Why is there so much confusion for many people regarding our origin? Life is more magical than you think. "Don't play with witchcraft though. Life is magical but dont play with evil magic The Lord is the ruler of the universe.

Bongani Gwamanda,Desperation by this commission is sad...🙇🏽‍♂️ @dada true 🤞🏾 "Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe has insisted that he never denied visiting the residence of the Gupta family in Saxonwold Brain never denied visiting Guptas stop lying 🙇🏽‍♂️ @makhosi please get your facts straight 🙏🏾 "@Bongumenzi nothing This guy is wasting our time... @Ndaxola we also need to know what happened to R500bln that just disappeared in 4 months 🙇🏽‍♂️

vincent kganyago,there is no need to go through the whole log book pretorious is wasting time
kevindbn007,He has a log book?
skip,ARE WE TO BELIEVE THAT THE VIRUS STOPS WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR MASK TO SPEAK. LOL
Dominic Przybylski,If I remember correctly Brian Molefe denied ever going to the Guptas' Saxonwold home? lol I remember - very famous case of crocodile tears. "In addition to R25 million pension payout for a few months service he was also collecting ""backpacks"" of cash from ""Saxonwold"". Molefe must be swimming in money." That may explain why Denel is bankrupt and cannot pay wages anymore. "These guys must be busy every day collecting bags of money from Guptas """Carpet baggers""" @Prns Chrmng Cannot trust anybody if your money is dirty. "They took billions Also easy to forget about a few hundred thousand left in the boot of a car. What size bag needed to fit R600 million in R200 notes? Knox vault is laundromat for dirty money.
Thabo Mokoaleli,Brian Molefe by then claimed he went to a Shebeen 😂🙈😅 "Interesting Evidence One is meticulous 👌👌 Seeing our dirty linen Witness 3 also saw the convoy of former President Zuma going out of Saxonwold Shebeen 🙈🤷😂Yoooo!
Solly 12,That was the day of the crocodile tears 😭 from Molefe dada ngova mobile phone location

Bongumenzi Nxumalo,"I am quite confused Bongani Gwamanda if we cannot prove more than association how do we charge him of criminality?? "Gugulethu Dube "This reminds me of Mokonyane & Bosasa "If Gordhan is already making excuses
Gugulethu Dube,The state capture is bringing some real evidence You need to understand the law of evidence to get a proper grip of this evidence and why its being led The only inference to make is that State capture commission has more evidence to go with this bag empty/full bag evidence "@Bongumenzi evidence like this is always set not as direct evidence but as laying the ground to prove a major proposition NB most cases if not all are decided by the decision maker making a reasonable inference from the evidence profered (1) Truth of the Molefe frequented the Gupta residence - inference Molefe had a relationship with the Guptas "(2) Evidence -Molefe always traveled with a bag to the Guptas (3) Evidence of the frequent visit between the Guptas and Molefe - inference there was a well established relationship between the Guptas and Molefe (4) The relationship between the Guptas and Molefe - taken with the evidence of the businesses of the Guptas- proves a collusive behavior. "Take away the money evidence for a minute "Sammy Thlapi probably these drivers were pinching some stacks @Sifiso Zulu probably the commission came to them with evidence from transnet vehicle records "Where is Norma Gigaba Gigaba here we go Definitely the security officers at the erstwhile Gupta residence will be summoned to give evidence. "How was these large sums of money delivered to the Gupta residency?? Probably someone with the banks worked with them
Glxtchyy !,Uhh Idk what I’m doing here
Sibusiso Sibusiso,@Gwamada inference was that he never visited Guptas @Gwamada that is the reason there is circumstantial evidence Molefe still works for Defence Force even now why circumstances evidence would not cut it @melusi n makhosi you arguing over nothing @Ally what interests do have in these inquiries Chinese looks the same to me
Ivan vries,wait and see because it might nit make sense for you now but surely it does make sense for the commission some of us talk as if we were there the times the corrupt state capture cabal were busy stealing...why defending the corrupt cabal
Nyambeni Mboneni,yerrrrr Mr molefe nad bag
Rudolph Cele,I hope orange uniform is getting ready for him. and not end up talking only and no arrests this is breaking news. but tomorrow molefe will deny same old story

I don’t understand Or maybe it for the purpose of when they are drunk 🤷🏻‍♂️ "But still Belinda "Regardless Belinda "And remember Belinda "It’s gonna be very difficult for the likes of Gigaba "The lesson here that we must learn is don’t eat alone I remember Des Van Royeen also met Mr Bobat at Melrose Acre A million Rand 🤦🏽‍♂️ "DJC must summons Issa to testify "I don’t think so Bophelo Come Sifiso Come on Sifiso I could have opened that box 📦 and close it again like before Benediction remember these were CEOs of big SOEs Sifiso Zulu you’re irrelevant can you rather comment on the evidence this guy is giving But that’s what we doing now and you talking about WMC and Ramaphosa 🤷🏻‍♂️ Let’s hear what witness number 3 will say I also thought so Gugulethu 😂😂😂don’t record Matshela Koko Thier Personal Assistance (PAs) must also come forward to assist DCJ Zondo "Very credible Mr Gouws Eyewitness 3 should have helped himself with that money and resigned Patrick these monies was all over they even didn’t remember some "@ Patrick.Salamfo you take 100k from that Chinese bag Where’s is Mr Jimmy Manye and Mr Matshela Koko drivers 🤷🏻‍♂️ No man Patrick not with that dirty lots of money Maybe that bag had 2 million you take 100k only Maybe there’s a bank at Knox vault 🤷🏻‍♂️ They knew thier monies were safe there @Kenny the Guptas left with Knox vault it doesn’t exist anymore "I understand why Sifiso surname is Zulu And we adjourned Don’t worry PG will come soon for Tom Monyane

Pheladi Lamola,😲😲😲 Come on Keith.
Inspiration Afri,"""if you love your life
Ndaxola Mdrai,i just hope when he must be cross examined on these allegations he wont run AWOL.. eg Pravin Gordon we just want to know the truth about all that was happening in the 9 years of Zuma. and hoping all the corrupt will finally be brought to book. he should avail himself for cross examination and not come up with excuses "these are serious allegations against Brian Molefe. i dont think he will live them unchallenged. and if he does challenge them @Johannes Venter Mentor retracted her statements... so as Agrizzi in some of the things he said. dont single out Nomvula story i really hope these witnesses can still be protected and also be allowed to be questioned on these allegations. @Johannes you must have been watching another state capture commission lol @Sandra Bailey agree 100% but they must still be questioned on the things they are saying. we cant just accept them as gospel truth. @Johannes these allegations are made at the commission not courts. the time for courts will come after the commission finishes its work.
Johannes Venter,Gordhan never ran away - it is for judge Zondo to decide whether cross questioning is needed. This is not a court. They can take Gordhan to court if they want Rasheed Ally - which cabal - are you in cahoots with the Guptas? How can all the logs and the codes found by Thuli be wrong? Remember the shebeen in the area. "Rasheed Ally - you talk nonsense. The Commission has instructions and is following its mandate. It is not a court of law. If Molefe wants to cross question If Molefe feels he is slandered he can sue the witnesses. If a witness can show he is threatened then of course he can be kept out of the public eye. The witness must live to tell: ANC assassinates "Like ACE Gama also!! Nothing happened to Vytjie and Agrizzi. In fact the Hotel Owner confirmed what Agrizzi said about Nomvula's birthday. Netwok of cheating "Even if they retracted You guys are grappling with straw. We need a cashless society. The notes do not leave a trail. Rasheed Ally hates facts and pretends to be a psychologist. I guessed Rasheed is Gupta-related. They will be questioned in COURT. Abel Matshidiso - who would have paid them off? Yes - the courts will have to come. And then Molefe's advocate will bite these witnesses if they lie Whose silenece?? the witnesses are not silent. "What does ""binod"" mean??" "Even if the bodyguards have been paid off """WMC"" does not exist. ANC-Monopoly Capital exists. The ANC is the only that controls monopoly businesses via government and that at tax payers' costs" They ANC controls ALL the monopoly businesses in this country and steal them empty Almost every SOE is a monopoly or oligopoly. Is it?? Again that is under control of the ANC. But I know that De Ruyter works for a much lower salary that he could have earned elsewhere and that he was the 40th candidate to be approached. Also that he struggles because Eskom is corrupt at every level. The brown envelope culture Witchcraft??? Huh?? I find the two witnesses very brave - without them endangering their loves we are nowhere. I do hope they are protected. An attorney in Potch is fighting the fracking - do not know who is involved? No I have not. It was an interim remark in a wider conversation. Try contact Hans-Jurie Moolman attorneys in Potch. Another witness a leather brown bag. "Fracking is getting gas out of soft stones below the earth by water-with-chemicals under high pressure. It provides cheap fuel

Rasheed Ally,These witnesses will withdraw their evidence when challenged like Vytjie Mentor Jonas did .They have been set up by a cabal . so the zondo circus encourages faceless nameless witnesses bit denied Molefe to cross question previous witnesses .A transparent judiciary I thought it was . sbusiso fairness to get to the truth . not anonymous evidence to get media excited . This is a bag full of bulls hit. He had a sight of bank notes in the bag . which crook will leave a bag full of money unlocked ? so the Guptas may have had Fnb Standard Absa Nedbank branch at Saxonworld ? bags &bags of money . There's a strong Goondaan Jonas hand in all 3 witnesses
Swartbooi Home,witness no 1 you beauty take a bow sir. This is not a cross examination . they are just going through the statements and evidence already on record. the investigators would have already checked and verified the info /CCTV footage etc.
