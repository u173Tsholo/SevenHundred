Dominic Przybylski,Gosh - restarted so soon after lunch! "While we on this two year talk shop about corruption Hundreds of millions paid out for PPE to ""businesses"" in Gauteng Many don't have websites or phone numbers. "Read ""Gauteng‚Äôs Covid-19 Expenditure Disclosure Report adds murk to troubled waters"" on Daily Maverick." "This commission is a classic case of ""fiddling while Rome burns""." "The hundreds of millions and staff for this commission should be transferred to NPA. We need arrests trials and convictions SA government is already bankrupt. Cannot operate without borrowing billions. Cannot borrow forever. "What did Cyril do to prevent corruption when he was deputy president? How could he have been ""shocked"" when it seems that everyone else in the country knew more about what was happening than he did?" Competitive bidding is a farce when the government only asks for bids from people who are not competitive. "@Craig Johnson what did he achieve other than a permanent place at the head of the BEE queue He did nothing to prevent corruption like he did nothing to prevent a violent end to the Marikana strike. Being a politician is about serving politicians. @Ndumieh Mokoena because they have access to tax money. Capitalism is a game of competition where the people who do the job best are the winners. Communism is a game without competion where everyone is a loser i.e. equal. @Sibusiso Cilo We simply cannot survive if we assume that everybody outside of treasury cannot be trusted. Unfortunately that does seem to be the case. @Sal SA Unfortunately it cannot work in a competitive global economy. The only way to get rid of corruption is to embrace a free market where people who are incompetent are allowed to fail. SAA is a classic example. This government is spending billions on a failure which will continue to fail. Billions more disappearing into all the other SOEs just because they cannot accept that their method of operation is a total failure. """3 people"" in control of trillions every year... How will that work?" Centrally controlled economies don't survive. @Sal SA What's wrong with letting the economy operate according to supply and demand? "Instead of giving somebody an RDP house It's only in movies where the criminals look sinister and ugly. The successful ones are excellent at pretending they are honest and reliable. @Craig Johnson 255 million to do the job. 211 million profit. Profit is so huge that 20 or 30 million missing was not something worth worrying about. Standard BEE procedure. Paying the price of the sun for a candle. "That's why there's no money left for housing Joint ventyre or zol venture... This is so unreal. @watson mutanga exactly Didn't question the missing money because he couldn't bite the hands which fed him. Who is JT if not Jimmy Tau? J T - Jacob Tuma? He's claiming gross negligence. He should have called his company Acne Consulting then would have his company name appear at the top of alphabetic lists. How can somebody as negligent as this earn mega millions? @Ndumieh Mokoena I think there were some arrests for people who were not wearing face masks.

Mosima Kgomo,We are trying to apply for tenders and got rejected but tenders are given to politicians children The blame is not Mr president. The people he is working with are selfish and not thinking for the economy. Not everything should be hold accountable to Mr president As much as the power is given to Mr president h shouldn‚Äôt be the only one responsible for misuse of funds. Funds are transferred to different departments and that‚Äôs where selfish become selfish How come you have capacity but subcontractor. Why don‚Äôt tenders be given to people who are capable I suggest they stop this tenders as most politicians are very rich because of them. Now being a politician is not about serving but quick wealth "How didn‚Äôt you know your partner is subcontracting you‚Äôre lying Sir When filling documents there is a part to disclose that or you didn‚Äôt read your documents before submitting Sir Stop telling about Mr who talk at your matter at hand Sir Why do you submit for tender without resources "What was your disclose on your tender documents  How much did you pay for your tender to be approved

"how to get away with Corruption.. ""I did know""  oops didnt know maybe contracts should be written in all the official languages.. maybe they will understand what words mean they have the capacity but we'll subcontract.. push the buck revenue less cost = profit... is that profit not subject to tax? 28% or are BBBEE exempt?
