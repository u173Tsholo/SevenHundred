Solly 12,Why is Zondo busy with other things when there’s so much to deal with here "Anne M yes he did "Lex Luger true Lex Luger I understand the sarcasm but there’s Other Justices in the concourt So Aggrizzi is the only one to hold his hand up & say I did wrong things i should not have done Who was minister of defence at the time & she’s still a minister of defence
Madelein R,I think he want to get a point out but none of the people is saying what he wants to hear
Nielan Nagan,pls arrest someone

Hard drinkers and high flyers @Ian Owen Maloney DID you study with him? The DCJ has called their bluff. "@Ian Owen Maloney But he has that familiar look Just imagine aunty Adv demanding answers from a husband who returns home @2AM @kgotso selome 😁😁😁😁😁 his best defence will be: sweety I was at the bar😁😁😁😁 The DCJ wants to nail this witness 72% Guy is back "@Tholang Mokoena This kind of lawyer never prepares

Wena unjani... @Pastor J hehehehehe... in JZ voice @Sindiswa Moolman kushushu nje qha... @Lex Luger what is te current argument about deputy presidents & ministers? @Lex Luger and the I heard Swati King mother in the argument I DO NOT RECALL @Elton Cowin not where the Guptas issue is concerned. It made news immediately & therefore becomes difficult to forget. @goolamv lol "He thinks saying ""I do not recall"" exonerates one." @Yose Human Zuma is just gonna take them even in bigger circles @Kevin Allister Simon he's gonna respond in Meandos lol @Yose Human kwaaaaa!! @Yose Human I think you are a bit out of it. A flight doesn't just get diverted. A flight scheduler was here last week and painted a picture of how much work it takes @peter pott lets do it. lol @Ian Owen Maloney Zondo is quite sharp & experienced & this guy won't trick @Magda Seguin Indeed! He has access to all the documents but one but he's dilly dallying... lol Well done Evidence Leader Indeed! @Sindiswa Moolman still here? ZUMA is the best dilly dally person... Mr Meandos
Kevin Simon,Uncomfortable but true! Prior witness said only heads of state or deputy may land there. Proves all previous reports are unreliable. Get the one the previous PP did. Cut all the crap. "He sounds like Col Oliver North of the Iran Contra hearings. Standard reply was Agreed Magda but then he has moments of absolute clarity. Amazing Zuma meandos 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Oh Goody. there are tapes...😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 All this is proving is that the previous report was a whitewash. 😏 This means those recordings are damming. Lock them up.
Thulani Bukani,he's trying to keep Zuma clear seems like the recordings are explosive uZuma yinja shame
Gareth Morgan,he speak therefore he lies
Zamo Ngobese,defensive man is back
Magda Seguin,Beholden to Zuma for giving him an ambassador job They all cover up for number one "Shame He knows he is in deep...dont remember...eish His testimony will be shredded to pieces in a court of law "Pity the majority of ANC voters dont have access to these lies @Elton Cowan why do the other witnesses remember? It's their work for goodness sake! Very poor memory Memory not poor ....its BAD..which court will believe this hogwash? Excuses The Thalys (bullet train) takes less than two hours to Amsterdam from where I am Lawyers not seeing how serious this is "A stud is not necessarily intelligent This guy thinks he is above everyone else I have so much respect for the DCJ Brilliant!! This lawyer speaks down to DCJ Voila!!! I hope they didn't doctor the recording Thank you Ms Norman!! @Tholang Mokoena if he is innocent he must just admit that Zuma gave the orders "This guy will trip up "Everybody gets thick yomes of documents  Why should they listen to the red riding before it is played at the commission *recording This guy want to prescribe to the DCJ It's a sign of things to come @Peter pott Delaying tactics What rights when they allowed 200 Guptas to land at Waterkloof? And on top of it the Estina money paid for the wedding.This is what I meant when I said they are taking us for idiots This is the first witness causing such nonsense Ambassoder by default

So they got documentation except for the recording "If they postpone to another date Rox. And zuma is gonna demand an interpreter "I told you Yose.. innocent I don’t know... but I know Msholozi said people are gonna regret asking for this Inquiry
Eddy Monnapula Nkadimang,"the chair has long seen these is a liar
Reinette Raubenheimer,be corrupt ....and you get a nice job as ambassador..... wonderful.....

"we can't also dcj spending too much time here. we need him at the concourt. issue of reserve bank ☺☺ someone is gonna leak the recording. and our journos will write about it before commission starts. 😕😕
clive oconnell,6 years engraved on his brain with notes and grooming from lawyers. Plus you must remember why you got big pay rise and now job. Zuma can’t even see ha has swimming 🏊‍♂️ pool not 🔥 firepool Listen before Zuma puts hit on him
Ian Owen Maloney,smart questioning by the evidence leader "all corrupt witness is mandated by their lawyers to just respond if in corner with: ""I don't recall""" "when you guilty. just raise your tone JZ is the best employer in south Africa. great time to be a lawyers for witnesses appearing. billing is high and daily rate killing DCJ is a gentlemen in law this lawyer looks a frat boy. @lex luger I don't recall @Lex Luger indeed yes.
