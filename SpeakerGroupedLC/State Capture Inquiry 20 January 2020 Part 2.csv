Teressa Pavlakis,Vote for a new gov with honor and not entilted to earn They want monies for the time they where in jail or exile But they want to go after Tawane------
chiz Coti,crooks must be charged...
Derek Main,@pius194 I suppose it depends who you talk to. @james 112 Breitbart is fake news @redriger Howzit Anything exciting today? Politicians are all the same. The ANC has become just like the Nat government. Only in it for themselves. NEVER trust a politician! @XhoiXhoi GrandSon Careful what you wish for. The EFF are politicians - they tell you what you want to hear but are only in it for themselves. They've already started acting like politicians - stealing VBS funds and living the champagne and caviar life but wearing overalls just to fool everyone. @Vincent Sipho Khumalo Very wise - they are all the same. @Fidhffjgf Dgygd Democracy only works if the voters hold the public servants to account. @Jabu Malinga He's one of the untouchables and must be dealt with. @Paul Buchel Multitasking @moelamin jaiteh Only if you allow yourself to be sucked in by the BS. @moelamin jaiteh I don't have all the answers - I suppose it's a matter of educating them on their rights and responsibilities as voters.
Wildthing,Puis you race batting. people of all race are investigated. and found guilty. if Law and Order is not in place then this is what happens. let's stay in RSA and leave USA alone. we are not Americans. GrandSon stay on subject or you leave. open case ar police if you have evediance of wrong doing. here it's about Durban police please can all focus on this story for now. it's about how the police functioned with rouge members. not political parties. and chain of command. Grandson. what's your point who here denies it happened.
Bongumusa Mabika,Car manufacturers have long term contracts with the state as you cannot wake up tomorrow with a new brand in the market. So you can't change them every 3 years. The same goes for mines.
Derrick saperstein,"Hey Guys "Well said
Elvis Malakoane,Jacob Zuma white monopoly capital is not a government or Ministers Jacob Zuma make sure you don't make a habit of being obnoxious cos it will stick with time Thelsa Me and my wife did not benefit Lorraine Naidoo apartheid was bad as we all know but they left functional municipalities though state was bankrupt but systems were there and functional State capture was a Holocaust xhoixhoi grandson you must be taking a drug of some sort from 1978 in our township we got electricity we never had load shedding xhoixhoi the more you make your statements the more you expose your ignorance bagof redriger I see somebody left a bag idiots open today if police are so corrupt then where do you report corruption
Thelsa,Is there anybody on this forum who did not 'score' something from the State Capture. F#ckittt ! It seems like there is not a soul left in SA who did not benefti !!
Christiaan du Plessis,"White Monopoly Capital is a term coined out by a PR comany did business with the Guptas The legacy of apartheid is obviously going to be tough to erase. But the ANC should have done much more. It can't just always blame apartheid while they are milking the state coffers dry. The ANC has effectively bankrupted the country and have done little to improve the lives of millions of poor black SA'ns. Apartheid was evil but the ANC has failed. The EFF's downfall is it's own leaders.
Lorraine Naidoo,shem me to nothing from government ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ I never heard all this in the apartheid era. they did it discreetly hy Pillay dont delay.come pay back the money WOW THATS MONEY FOR JAM I thinks Panda bought a real panda Xhoixhoi yes we fighting for freedom at that time .my family was locked up. The blacks was treated badly .thru wont allowed in town after 9pm Chritiaan I agree
Anwar Syed,well said Elvis. Jacob Zuma has really sunk this beautiful country. Zuma needs to appear before this commission and be honest. Apartheid is only a smoke screen for politicians like Jacob Zuma and his ilk to fleece this country. These greedy politicians don't give a damm for their own people who are living in squalor conditio
Raven Penny,the majority are stil living in poverty why always give apartheid the blame let apartheid RIP they are not stupid just full of hate then live with it but don't mess up S.A. greed and hatred will destroy us it will never stop the blame game the masses are in denial lol and my tummy is not ok today must be apartheid apartheid is death and gone corruption is the new kid on the block ag you can steal and do whatever you want just give apartheid the blame go see what's happening in Zimbabwe then decide if you will vote eff please let all of us who are following this and are dismayed with this government stand up and do something lets start educating our people in churches at school let's mobilize let the world know what's going on just with as we did with apartheid let us occupy parliament let us rise up the time this commission wraps up it will be to late and then it's still the court cases
Rusty SpyGoat,@XhoiChoi GrandSon stop deflecting South Africa's current problems to apartheid... ANC members are being investigated for corruption and people are blaming Apartheid.. This is how stupidly brainwashed some people are. They are the ones who still vote for ANC that destroys SA no one said anything racist. "my wife cheated on me "before apartheid we have a communist in the chat that believes all the wealth should be shared and then we live in perfect harmony. Where have we heard that before..? Zimbabwe shared all the wealth
LAUGH OR CRY,"the root of the problem most also be address "rusty blame it on post apartheid treatment. treat ppl fairly. the unfair post apartheid treatment created corrupt black politicians "real children of S.A. most claim what was stolen from them. let the back live in peace "ANC is back run party EFF is the solution. job done EFF will treat ppl fairly. this is what you ppl don't want "living equally doesn't mean one is communist DEMOCRACY only works for thieves. Holmes fortunately eff works in the opposite ANC created EFF only eff works the opposite side. the pale skin won't never agree with malema. DEMOCRACY will only work if voters are INTELLIGENT. we do not have that. meanwhile the system is a deceive "redriger "redriger "DEMOCRACY  the media can be bought common that's not relevant Derek. we have many ppl who aren't able to think rationally? wnat abut them Derek. are they doing that really. if we really know the kind of ppl we putting in office I swear we wouldn't be having such issue at first "free
Hans Gunter,no please not
Michael Holmes,"Political leaders should never ever loot poor peoples money "The problem is that state capture affects more people "White people will leave SA if there is economic disaster The ANC needs to be replaced with a multi party democracy one of the reasons it hasn't changed is because of the ANC which demonstrates ANC has similar tactics as apartheid people because they oppress people of colour in SA No service delivery becomes racist because it perpetuates black poverty "how can you say that apartheid was nothing EFF will turn SA into Zimbabwe and whites will just leave very easy there will be only a political elite who will bask in wealth just like Zimbabwe and there will be no economic upliftment "EFF will destroy the economy "Zimbabwe has 90% unemployment EFF are just a manifestation of the ANC's Cold War influence and its sad that people believe in that nonsense "I mean what has Julius done apart from politics He is so reckless telling poor people to have more babies which would make them more poor EFF is literally another faction of the ANC and it shows that we have been consumed by the useless ANC NO but yases ANC is such a cancer that it made the EFF and has infected people's brains
Maryann Diamond,what did tge ANC promise you? housing right .. so dont blame apartheid anymore @Xhoi dont lie . im coloured and im gonna leave actually run lol true "thieves
thulani fadashe,folks painting apartheid as a lesser evil then what State Capture is are smoking something very strong. Apartheid government was responsible for crimes against humanity and they killed to keep going.
Pastor J.J,Can all the Racist nonsense stop and not be imposed on all of us on the chat....Please I appeal to you all I am Paul @Paul Buchel
Kevin,"So we can blame apartheid for Donald Trump "The first post apartheid child was born 25 years ago AND SHOULD be educated Panday and family have been charged and going to trial shortly. This morning they made application to Zondo to exclude this dudes testimony because it is prejudiced. Its a slam dunk case ðŸ˜‚
Grandma the Glorious.,I was watching Breitbart how I get here?
Granny Mokwena,corruption apologists are sickening
Lorna Kavanagh,Because of the looting of taxpayers money and state owned companies eg Eskom Transnet Saa etc means this country is in a dire financial state... struggling to meet its obligations.
ndoda nala,eff is a solution
Cerebis,@Rusty SpyGoat And now everybody's got nothing? EFF is the ANCYL.....nothing else. @redriger Agreed. @Kevin Unemployment under the youth is actually much higher than 30%. That is in my mind the ticking bomb in SA.
Vincent Sipho Khumalo,until the wealthy African's and their families invest in the research of all levels and development of the respective Countries. there will be no success or achievements "i trust no politician "Raven Penny "Our present police men and women "@dereck main true that "@Raven Penny

Lucky Thwala,how do we except police to guard us when they're corrupt to this level?.
Ania Teo,What I can't understand is the brothers across the border don't vote Zanu out. Same mentality thinking that EFF we save us. Complete stupidity.
Jabu Malinga,"Panday was a small fish. there is corruption taking place valued in the 100s of millions "Yes is there a need for this lady? Is the commission lookin into the capture and corruption of the entire water board of the kzn south coast which has been bankrupted. vat alles
FredBKevin,The evidence leader ? "L@moelamin  Wentzel says : Chair I think he is here for the whole of tomorow. Wentzel shouldnâ€™t think but know that level of detail. Lols Why did they choose such a long winded retired judge Oh then just judge I fall asleep when he talks
