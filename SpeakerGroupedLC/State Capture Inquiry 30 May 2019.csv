Madelein R,Morning
Lucky123 Thwala,last night I didn't sleep well thinking about this crooked Brain molefe selling out the country molefe and his band of train robbers hey hey this bursted molefe New justice minister Ronald Kalula must take this thieves toe to toe "We have instructed our attorney's to appeal not even courts should allowed to silence the truth
Fils de l'homme,hello hola
Thelsa,Brian Molefe should be charged with treason !!
Sebation Nantsika,Molweni We need lifestyle audit to all this institutions Especially municipalities and get rid of districts municipalities
Gloria Baloyi,HALLO
Derek Main,Brian Molefe was one of the ANC's blue-eyed boys. Blame the ANC for his destruction. "The new cabinet does not inspire confidence in the much-heralded ""New Dawn"". Ramaphosa has failed his first test. Seems like more of the same from the ANC." @Zikhona Zondani You try and stop me. @Thami Ngwenya Definitely not David Mahlobo! He's a crook. As for Thulas Nxesi - he tried to sell us the 'fire-pool' story Angie Motshekga is useless - look at our education system that she has been in charge of for years now. Blade Nzimande - useless. The caviar communist. Gwede Mantashe - Bosasa beneficiary - crook. All communities fighting mining companies must be nervous. Gwede certainly won't protect them. Maite Nkoana-Mashabane - useless - she gave Grace Mugabe diplomatic immunity illegally and allowed Bashir to escape the law. Fikile Mbulula - a Guptoid - crook. @Thami Ngwenya I have little choice - all I'm saying is that it's more of the same from the ANC. @Zikhona Zondani Don't bother looking at the ANC then. @Thami Ngwenya Aaah - the Ramaphoria argument. You're just fooling yourself. @Zikhona Zondani Have you got anything worthwhile to say? Ramaphosa has failed his first big test. Selecting a cabinet we can trust to rescue SA from the brink. And significantly reducing a seriously bloated and expensive cabinet. "@Minoctar Sithole The problem is @Thando Nkutha I agree - I think he's failed his first test. "Like I said before @Kevin Allister Simon The same could be said of the ANC and corruption. @sipho cebo Or be ruled by thieves. Is this the best the ANC has to offer? @sipho cebo I agree that is the solution but unfortunately we have fools for voters. Some things just have to be said. @sipho cebo True - I just can't understand the logic of protesting against bad service delivery one day and voting for self-same party that is failing on service delivery the next day. That's idiotic. My feeling is that Holomisa is the voice of reason in parliament. He is an elder statesman. Yes "I believe the DA favours big business over citizens. If ever there is a conflict between business and citizen's rights @Keamogetswe Andries Motsepe At least you are giving your vote some thought - unlike the ANC voters. They think they're supporting a soccer team. @Keamogetswe Andries Motsepe Not that smart - the majority voted ANC @Thami Ngwenya You can't fix stupid.
herven compton,Wow
Zee Zondani,I thought we were hear to talk about molefe and transnet not Cyril and what you think he did wrong. ðŸ¤” "I also dont get the blade nzimande appointment but SACP would have been making noise right now so to please our alliances Angie!!! ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜• "Can the heaven please open up and give us ""saints"" since everyone on the planet is a ""crook""ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚" "@Thami Ngwenya so true. complaining and throwing of toys is not going to help. Fikile Derek should take his views to twitter.ðŸ˜‚ hel be more successful there. ðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ•º @Thami Ngwenya can we please not entertain trolls please ðŸ˜• does anyone know when this testifying will come to an end. these people have resigned 2 years ago Molefe has probably moved to dubai ðŸ˜‚ so glad too "bullying other people just because they hold different view such not be allowed 500k plus public apology ðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ "True to that no more taking of bullying from them

Born free,One sensible comment the EFF make is that CR has not reduced a bloated cabinet he has appointed more Deputy Ministers that means his cabinet has 34 members and not 28. @Jordial.. is this a movie you recommend we watch? The Afro 4000 trains worth R600 million were unsuitable for local conditions.. they were too high. @Jordaii. Is this a virus? The diesel locomotives supplied by NCRS had major alternator problems. In short this was a tender to procure Locomotives and trains with a total of R2. 65 billion but exceeded this amount by more than R1. 2 billion. haha @ Jacob Zuma you will have to sell your expensive hats and shirts but I am certain it will be Nkandla soon. I think 18 locomotives are waiting to be delivered at a harbour in China. Remember they are assembled here. This was a R600 million contract that went up by R69 million @Kevin. Yes To date 185 locomotives R50bln was split between 4 global railway groups but infect this entire project far exceeded this amount. The entire cost was likely to be R134 billion "The ""NewDawn of Corruption ""." You must take into account the years that Zuma was deputy President and President "They did not do their homework IE. locomotives not compatible with our tracks I thought OEMs were the Transnet mechanical Engineers responsible for the assembly of these trains? OEM = Original Equipment Manufacturer sister to the left is unprofessional Total predicted cost R134 billion Iwish I had owned warehouses to store these trains. R11200 per sqm?? @Derek.. who was your choice to vote for.. just curious to see if we were in favour of the same party? Is that Holomisas party? I hope all you lovely folks will vote for my party in 5 years time it is SAFE.. South Africa For Equality. "With my party it will be SAFE Self sufficient that is Well I take a leaf from Singapore's history why is that? EFF to pay Trevor Manual R500 000. So glad. @ Thami I take that as an insult and voters are not smart they voted the ANC again that's not smart. Yes on the news. The EFF will not get away with insulting and intimidating anyone. Most voters are not smart Especially when STUPID is a genetic defect
wiz owert,Aa!
Wildthing,Go Proteas
Jan Davies,Protea power!
Kevin Simon,How many locomotives were delivered to date? Of the 1 064 original order? That's more than one year's tax collection! KKK probably would argue they are dealing with racial prejudice. ..just not the way we expect.
Margareth Waterboer,"Cameraman 
William Pieters,1.4 trillion rand got stolen over the last 4 years in this great country. don't forget how wealthy you have to be to belong to the G20.
