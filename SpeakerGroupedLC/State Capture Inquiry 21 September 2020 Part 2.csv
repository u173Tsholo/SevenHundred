Blake Yogi,🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ "True. He asks so many questions "There is no acceptable answer it aint the light bothering him. its these sins bothering him @Masego 🤣 "@Canis Exactly Chad. the commision is an inquiry. they bring facts. They will send a report + recommendations.NPA will take it from there to bring accountability. So glad someone finally understands the word "If only everyone understood this is an inquiry only "@Thabo "@Thabo "and yet she was eating and had a birthday party of over R100 000 and came back to confess @Kevin I am waiting for that day I tell you "@a b c "@Kevin "@Kevin "and yet yet smart enough to create sly corruption plans and so elegantly cover it up "@Val Corruption and Apartheid are both rotten and disgusting but they cannot be compared. They must be treated seperately "Val @Val great point True Chair he is holding back. He knows everything Stutter stutter. Confess baba
Mbuso Ndlovu,Zondo is learning a lot were Zondo will be implicated in this commission Zondo was spotted in the Gupta weeding enjoying currry😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 We are tired of this commission. When will criminal case begin??????? Taxpayers Cash @brutos17 Locking Zuma will not solve the problem. We need all the monies payed back Malema was once a Tenderprenuer before Zuma fired him Cyril must just make more copies of R200 notes then we we all be rich😂🤣😂🤣 SAA must be sold "Correct "@Himesh Mothi You won't see her behind bars 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Ministers are leaving slavish life styles. While some people drink water with pigs This witness has already admitted everything. Why pretorious is wastng taxpayers time and cash?????????????????????????? @Himesh Mothi Don't cry for a spilled milk @a b c Unbelievable In America being arrested is a fassion In american prison you eat a very nice food Food that you cannot afford outside American prisons are Hotels Who is the gratest musician of all time 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 "Ladies and Gentlemen let us all agree We all hve financial problems so if the oppotunity present itself take it especially nothing major has happened to stealing criminals before But i have now learnt from their mistakes
harpreet 88,zondo in anything else
Mohamed Mia,@mbuso. You serious
Chad MacCrae,Everyday Zondo reports back to the guptas instead of Cyril...so they can plan there next move 😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬 trying his best!!!! he tried his best to loot from our tax money Zuma's must be handcuffed to a super maximum prison and key thrown away the money is spread across many countries What we need to understand is what is this commission going to do with all this evidence I don't understand prisons are full with petty thieves...so the law is actually to steal big to avoid prison these are our leaders he doesn't need to hide..he is rich and he knows nothing is going to happen to him even if we vote for a honourable person..its more about who the person is going to be surrounded by...the people around them 😂😂😂😂 we said the same for previous president canis Cyril is just another face to the ANC..but the same outfit this is commission does not deal with accountability they just showing us responsibilty of all involved true which goes against every definition of what a democratic country is true..its a loophole for corruption no we don't have a black govt.we have an ANC govt..they only care to enrich themselves who are in power and gain as much as possible while they in power ANC believe they were the only ones previously disadvantaged therefore justified all the looting yet forgetting about the current disadvantaged there is no excuse because if I must go now into a shop and steal a packet of chips I'm going to be arrested..how is race going to be an excuse for breaking a law but what's the same is that nothing could be done about corruption then and now yes because his innocent untold proven guilty in COURT I think both crimes are about oppressing others val I agree or dead gavin watson the entire ANC has been infected...there is no alternative within its current structures Ramaphosa is himself a puppet to the ANC we could of maybe had arrests already

brutos17,Lock up Zuma Now!!!!😤😤😡😡😡 @Mbuso Ndlovu every month they push back the trial!!! locking up Zuma is the first step to getting back the U$ 29 billion he stole!!!!!😡 @L Ll South African news will never tell you how much money Zuma stole!! think about govt spending for South Africa and the Guptas... its usually hidden in a Deutsche Bank account in Switzerland!!! Lock up Zuma!! 😤😤😡😡
Tlakale Motswiane,"Since his previous appearance @Chad Aimes i am with you on the looting but my point is he is nowhere near the likes of Nomvula in trying to cover his a$$
Val Speirs,I think the department's deliberately allowed the Tender validity period to expire in order to run away with the money. Zuma must be hand cuffed to the Witness chair. Foreign Bank accounts must be investigated. Then to be equal you must pay for the land because it was not free. I don't believe the apartheid regime was ever as corrupt as the ANC. Two different crimes. What the ANC has denied the poor is Crimes against Humanity. The ANC stole taxpayers money allocated to benefit the poor..that is crimes against humanity. The White Monopoly are the friends of the ANC just as corrupt I.e Watson and many others just like him. However the ANC is the monopoly. "Himesh..you can apply to a court to have your criminal record expunged after 10 years Weed is legalised now therefore any prior convictions or criminal record for possession of a small amount of weed for ones own use..should be expunged. They were all aboard the gravy train.
L Ll,No criminal case is going to follow. They will recommend tighter checks and balances. Just improve the tender system. Forget about anyone being charged with a crime 😩 Nah Zuma doesn’t have that kind of money unless you can prove it beyond any reasonable doubt lol Corrupt officials spend the loot quickly And it’s usually CASH transactions The money is being used for covid relief in America 😡😩😳 Brutos yes you are right about that Nothing lol Swiss banks are actually using the money to improve their economy while SA people are suffering

Unfortunately the masses see this as aspirational & keep voting these clowns in @Ntyab Mninw Mninw You want land.....Go earn it. You just want a handout....Chances are you will sell it ASAP to go buy yourself a mercedes benz "@Val Speirs : Difference is They helped their own I wouldnt put this clown in charge of my household "But Judge  "LOL.

Thabo Mokoaleli,Everything is yes from the lame duck Mr. Mokhesi 😂🤣🤷 Mokgetsi has given up. He has already seen that he has been caught by hard facts.

Angelo Doubel,🤣🤣🤣 @ a b c yep. and they like blame Apartheid for their corruption @ a b c look this situation 500 000 houses was never built. R 1 billion missing. how many poor people could have benefitted. 🤔 @ Himesh yep. I am voting Herman Mashaba. he has proven himself. @Vasie. I was reading an article in the daily maverick today. the US government is conducting investigation into Guptas accounts across the world. @ Anchor the net is closing on them.

Bonang Sithole,Commissions are part of accountability. So I will vote ANC again because they account through Commissions and other gatherings
KgaitseweM,@Bonang Sithole accountability without justice is not accountability. taxpayers have been funding this commission to run for a long time and who is in jail now?
Morwa Azania,"since the banks are clearly refusing to finance black owned emerging businesses "@Fred "@Fred "n to add on that @Visibly do you still believe anc has made this laws? Nna I think this things were written n given to anc n the same anc acted like Jet Li's n told us they wrote the laws n regulations
visibly annoyed,"@Eric Sithole thats my problem with the ANC @Vusimuzi Nkosi true but we would rather have no corruption then have have mostly corruption

a b c,"It's been clear for a long time that the ANC doesn't care about black people... thry just want their votes and bring up apartheid as a red herring every time someone exposes them It's not about race... it's about corruption... they try to turn everything into a race issue as a distraction @Blake Yogi Exactly!! All these tactics are jusr messed up Well they make everything about race but what they really care about is the money... they just use race as a diversion @Angelo Doubel Exactly... and many supporters just go with it... @Blake Yogi lol... she ran out of somewhat useful things to say... it's all so hypocritical @Blake Yogi agree on the race thing I wish people would see things through reality... race/gender/age whatever is just an old excuse that has no bearing... corruption is corruption @Angelo Doubel they're heartles man I shortly listened to Al Sharpton on Sun... I think his mentality is just feeding the fire... Yeah... some people may know they're corrupt but since they benefit from the corruption they keep the ANC in power... And when they're not blaming white folk they're blaming foreigners who are here legally "@Continua it's not ""chances are"" they will definitely sell the land after acquiring it... I've spoken to a bunch of people who want land and they admit that they won't actually use it but just sell it" The ANC really did this country a disservice... ANC is like a mafia... whistle-blowers are either bribed or threatened CR is also continuing the China takeover though... Perhaps it's in off-shore banks right now No politics governs us... people are evil SA could've been competing with other nations right now... but the last time the dollar was on par with the rand was 1987 Personally I'm getting a bit tired of hearing all this race and feminist nonsense... @Himesh lol 😂😂 Yes you're right Nkosi... but having a constitution just to break it afterwards is a problem Another case of not practising what they preach basically... 😅 I know of a case in the US a few decaded ago where a guy was thrown in jail for 10yrs for stealing a chocolate... he was still waiting for his actual trial But they forgot about him Cruel world cousin... @Himesh 100% agree... special treatment shows that the world just ain't fair... Generally yes... but some prisons are full of human rights violations Well if we did then we would also have to account for it Now we know what you would do Mbuso... Everyone is corruptible... that's true... but not everyone chooses to be corrupt...
kevindbn007,Well said @ Chad ....Ace your time has come I see this week being a shift in the ANC and how the top brass will shine the race card is old news now just stinking selfish thieves is that the legacy thats gonna be left thats how ppl will view the anc pity the bad apples really screwed up this country "ANC is "@Blake "@Blake eish Action SA is something to look at They knew Mr Zondo from their own cousins "a nation that looks constantly to the past and alwyas blames the past "learn from the past 1Bil = 1000 Million.......................sheeeeeeu we need to sue the ANC anc ..... hollow promises @anchor they all a bunch of thieves the demise of the anc as known is near "Mr Zondo CR's hands were tied.... he was the fall man "if you recall "when the ANC rejected him agreed @Chad Aimes 700Million in Water department "corruption where was CR then @Himesh. no other person would have had the ability to defend CR is very shrewd ppl are still without houses and their party stole it to enrich themselves "@MW spent on lambos evil is evil Gordaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan will have all the info "PPL are evil he ws finance minister

Himesh Mothi,"the thing about the apartheid government was that we knew they were corrupt "yet these anc cadres think it's ok to rob the very people that put them there "I fail to understand how earning a salary of millions a year disadvantages you  sa needs to realise corruption has no color...if anything it's worse when people indigenous to our land rob their own Blake apartheid was a system but that does mean its practices were not corrupt they looted money the very same way it's been looted now Zuma was the worst door though crying about white monopoly capital while he was selling our country to foreign interest "like we are basically owned by China and Russia due to loans zuma n his accomplices took for state purposes I agree val "the Anc is scared now though....mashaba is providing a real alternative the anc died the day they recalled Mbeki lol that lady upsets me...like how can u spend ur life as a doctor n be unempatic to the people of our land I do have respect for cr....he put alot on the line for the presidency "h but he is the lesser evil no Kevin politics is evil ABC that's also the last year weed was legal lol I was born in 87 "that women is an insult to the strong and righteous women of our country lol it'll probably be a saxonworld sheebeen "in my early 20's I was arrested along with some friends for possession of narcotics "my life yet I accepted it cos I was in the wrong as well "it's not crying every individual needs to be equal in the eyes of the law "this whole idea that anc cadres are special cos they fought apartheid is bs benefit over the many others that sacrificed as well hi val it's not state law as yet "but it doesn't bother me now I wonder if we ever going to get the guptas bk in sa thank Cyril changed the scope of the commission so they can use it zuma had it set so non of this would have been admissible in court "i would never steal it's all about the values you learnt growing up "I agree abc noooo what am I gna do for the next two hours lol did any one notice how trump is doing to America exactly what zuma did to us peace guys be safe
