Brian Ndlovu,...
Sir Dini Yalezo,SABC why you late when we about to hear abt your corruption 🤔
Jacqui Baumgardt,have we started yet? Please take this conversations somewhere else and focus on the state capture enquiry please bring Ms Hofmeyr back as evidence leader
Donnex Vuma,send them all corruption people to jail
Born free,This is taking forever.. I am going to watch The Ndlovu Youth Choir on America's got Talent.. they are amazing and in the Finals. I say if foreigners can start small businesses.. why can't black South Africans do the same or is it because they are too lazy? Have you ever noticed the difference in service between foreign Africans and African South Africans. There is an enormous difference in their attitude. It's an excuse to loot driven on by that mad hatter.. Malema and BLF The LOCALS want everything for nothing that's why they loot and steal and are a problem that must be dealt with quickly. Not all of them No-one is forced to buy drugs or expired goods. It's the Locals that have the problem. Target the ANC government for they should be held accountable for everything that has gone wrong. Then target Government buildings. Malema is behind the attacks on foreigners. He has to be sworn in and take the oath. They left because they had fake resumes Xenophobia has always existed and especially Tribal and Religion. You could be right 👉 "Aparheid had nothing to do with religion and religious differences but Xenophobia pertains to religious xenophobia Locals are also druglords Like the Democrats in America.. Same story Yes and just look at the Congo Africa is xenophobic to black people religious or otherwise. "Sudan What is the difference between Racism and Xenophobicism? It's nothing new. Pastor J. Stop blaming colonization . Xenophobia has always existed since the beginning of mankind. Tribalism is the old term for xenophobia. When Tribes wiped out other tribes. You can't attach white people who were born in South Africa. That's pathetic "Tribalism Ghana is making alot of progress its turning its economy around. The United Nations is watching this country and the government. 👎👎👎 Julius Malema is a circus and knows nothing about governance. True.. Paul They are wonga street thugs that started the attacks and looting. The police must use REAL bullets. Drug lords and Taxi owners Hi JACOB.. did you see Watson in an open casket yesterday.. you were talking as if he is still alive and in hiding??? Zuma.. you even said he could be at your Nkandla home. Ja.. Julius is a skelem South Africa first Love the Trump. Jacob.. you thought you were on America's Got Talent at the Watson funeral. They had to tell you enough is enough of the singing 😂🤣 🤣🤣🤣Sure Jacob you are a better singer than a politian.
Baby Smither,foreigners refuse to leave our land so what do you say?
Keith Hodgson,After more than 12 months you would expect them to have achieved some consistency in document numbering and presentation such as font size etc.
William Pieters,@Yin Yang thank you for been so aware.
Derrick saperstein,"BORN FREE
adrian albertyn,all foreigners dont start businesses they dont pay tax and sell expired goods that is crooked acumen loot the government what is the difference between xenophobia and apartheid
Instablogspain,💔💔
Antonie Engelbrecht,zondo backing off zondo showing true colours
Henry Mayambu,But the sad thing is that the looting of shops affects not only foreigners but also the local South African who will lose their jobs as a result. The standard of living for all is affected sadly. @Jack Sparrow I agree with you. Objectively we should all condemn xenophobia the way we condemn racism. If Nigerian are doing that they are equally wrong to target innocent business organisations in their country. "We are all Africans. People try to make it in life by coming to RSA. If they follow the law of the land "In line with @Pastor J 's view What South African nationals should bear in mind is that things can change. The vibrant economy RSA has today might be the preserve of another country in the region. South African will also need help
Lehlohonolo Mohapi,If you are a foreigner in South Africa and you are not happy with anything. How about you go back to where you are from! nobody is forcing you all to stay
Raymond Montshusi,The looters must take out their frustration on the government and leave the foreigners alone The Anc Gov never bothered to get foreigners documented since the dawn of our democracy and it is coming back to bite them Let us go and loot Luthuli House. Anc made all kinds of problems for our lovely country Xenophobia is a serious sickness entrenched by apartheid regime. I can't believe that black on black violence is still rife in 2019 ANC failed the people Africa belongs to all Africans. There must be a free movement within our borders but everyone who comes to another country must be well documented Stop the Xenophobic attack's on black brother and sisters. Follow your family history and you will find that your great grandfather is from Zambia
Sithembile Dodo,Zondo 🤔 but I understand Zondo's point
John New-world,"@Henry Muyambu
Jack Sparrow,xenophobia is the brother of racism xenophobia is no different from racism
Kudzanayi Muhlanga,Shame on you all South Africans.
Cerebis,@adrian albertyn Too late....the ANC has already done that!🤔🤔🤔😎😎 @Born free That you as a taxpayer pay for? What is the DCJ doing now? This whole argument is stupid and destroying the commission's reputation??? That is why the DCJ has a chamber...go there for that type of discussion? "@Henry Mayambu I agree @Pastor J 🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏 Agree...Sad "Most countries in the Wold has at one stage been colonized....UK
king Fazan Ajo,"Pieter willem Botha "@Pastor J just check this out "@Pastor J we cant run away from the truth "@samuel nkone you can see that am hving a meaningful chat with @Pastor J  "@Pastor J i think is disunity "@Cerebis and i think this has being our major set back my friend "@Diss & Dad yeah thats so true "@Yin Yang it has become an African thing @Yin Yang so you agree with those who said the black race is actually not complete humans? because according to what you saying we were born with this self hate. My skin is black so i consider myself an African. @I Am Free then what happened brother? how come we cant govern just 1.1billion people with 54 heads of states? and china can govern 1.4billion people with 1 head of state? some said it not religion "@Siphosethu Nase for you information

Kevin Simon,Wonder what got under DCJ's skin. I'm sure someone has been agitating and he needed to clear up his authority.
jasper dougal,"They should have addressed all of this in Zondo’s chambers 
Pastor J.J,Sadly the mentality of violence and stealing will continue even in the absence of foreigners. Foreigners are currently an excuse for these violent tendencies.Lets not be fooled. Very sad situation @king Fazan Ajo Your chat is going somewhere that is unpleasant and uneccassary and sometimes painful @king Fazan Ajo The point is that PW Botha was not neccassarily an intelligent man vs. being an oppressor. Any statement that blacks are unintelligent and not capable cannot be regarded as the truth. @king Fazan Ajo Lets not ignore the remnants of Colonization and this is not a black or african phenomon. Lets reflect on India and Pakistan amongst other colonized regions out of Africa. @Born free I think you missed the point. Colonization is not being blamed but the lasting impact of it cannot be ignored. Pakistan and India are still reeling from the impact 72yrs later. "@king Fazan Ajo Just 2 words. ""Domination"" and ""Control""" Anyway enough said. Lets focus @king Fazan Ajo Agreed @Asmareh Aklogh I totally agree with your sentiments @Craig Woodward We have live feed. Just try and refresh @Perter Nigeria Killing anyone or just the thought is a sin. You may be angry but 2 wrongs will not make a right. Be patient and allow the authorities to do their jobs. @Jack Sparrow You are very right @Jacob Zuma Hey Jakoob. I am praying for you Baba. Especially for when you are in the tronk. But then again I know you are a white male. hehehehehe

Thando you clearly making no sense. Are you justifying the killing? is Sad if you are. The police is there let them do their job. Thando your mission is to divide black people. "People are doing well and working hard while you in your bed sleeping If you suspect a person doing drugs report them to the police dont go to their shop and loot their hardwork.

Noxolo Tshabangu,We needed a TRC that was to deal with a criminalised population. Noone can walk into your home and mess up if you yourself do not allow them. We allowed criminality to take root.

I wish you enlightenment... @Thando clearly giving Trump a run for his money 🤣 @Thando. you are chasing your potential educators away. You lack problem solving skills so you blame others for the problems instead of learning how to problem solve. You did maths lit? Can see ... @Thando. Your last comment proves your obtuseness and inability to reason. I think I’ve just lost some brain cells trying to assist you. I give up @ Thando. That is the precise attitude that will make sure you remain as little as you are. I don’t have a boyfriend dumb face. Im gay

JD Grobler,South Africans live in Nigeria because they are trying to make a better economy for South Africa that you destroyed @Jacob Zuma @Jacob Zuma You say kill them. What you don't realise is that there are South Africans under attack in Nigeria now because of this ridiculous mentality of what is happening. @Jacob Zuma They not stealing our jobs. Majority of South Africans are too lazy to work and that is why they have been given the job @Jacob Zuma Most of the Nigerians are better educated than what you are. @Levers Khumalo I am talking about general work. lots of South Africans just want to sit on their backsides and reap benefits and not work for anything then come foreigners and work. @Thokozani Nyathi well I will have you know that you are incorrect. Sorry for spoiling your fun. Yes? @Jacob Zuma @Thando Nkutha Why? Because I am right? what happened too freedom of speech in South Africa?> @Jacob Zuma I am sorry that you had to suffer. But I am not from Europe. I am from South Africa. @Jacob Zuma Why do you have to make this a racial thing. I never once mentioned anything about history or the past. But I guess we see where your mentality is. @Thando Nkutha Oh I have a clue what is going on. and being of colour has nothing to with anything. coz there are lazy white people too that don't want to work and also get mad. @Thando Nkutha Why do people have to bring violence and race in to everything @Jacob Zuma hey what ever makes you sleep at night. at least we know now who the racists are @African Refugee I couldn't agree more with you @Thokozani Nyathi colour has nothing to do with experience or knowledge to get a job. it is dedication and determination @Thando Nkutha this does affect me. irrespective. because I am also a South African that is getting a bad name from what is taking place. @Thando Nkutha Been to Nigeria. Not as rude and racist as south africans @Thokozani Nyathi home to run to? Everyone has a home. @Thando Nkutha Why? because you are upset about being wrong? @Thokozani Nyathi I am not from Europe. @Thando Nkutha So then why don't they resolve the matter? @Thokozani Nyathi Define the meaning of African?! @Thando Nkutha don't get me wrong. Violence is not the answer to resolve this matter. @African Refugee safe and sound for now. @Jacob Zuma if you are the real deal. You ran this country in to the ground. @Thando Nkutha there is already blood on the streets. 5 killed yesterday. for what? @Thando Nkutha unfortunately that I can not comment on as I don't know the people that have passed. but I can say lots of things will cause unrest here. which I'd rather not do @African Refugee that is unfortunately the truth. false promises too
jackie china,fighting doesn't solve anything we all Africans why we fighting each other This nonsense must ✋ someone is using Jacob Zuma name it's not him
Godfrey Shirima,I think what could be perfect for the south Africans is to make laws that protect what they say their jobs not to destroy property and kill other for things that can be protected by simple laws. we have black south African in other african countries also...
