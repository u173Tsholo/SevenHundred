welton paulse,Eish Zondo late again. "@Abel Manyedi "Zondo didnt pay TV license on time Zondo is tired already Mara why dont they allow Adv Maleka to lead the witness? @Desmond Masilela lets hope so "@Edwin Arthur  "From the beginning files names and numbers have been a problem Z reminds Zondo too much about Zuma "We need strict professionalism here Guys where is Adv Maleka? Eish eish eish "@Magda Seguin  Eish General is lost @Magda Seguin And MCbreezie his deputy @Aniceth De Missamou . I picked that up as well "@Magda Seguin Something is MOERS wrong in our country I am starting to lose interest in watching this commission "@Magda Seguin "this reminds me of our soccer teams way back in ekasi "@Aniceth De Missamou  "@Magda Seguin "@Magda Seguin  "@Magda Seguin "@Magda Seguin @Musa Bakiti so jy kan afrikaans praat my maat @Musa Bakiti whats your native language? "@Musa Bakiti  "@Musa Bakiti Nooooooo Seems like corruption is a fashion trend or a status. Our government is just taking it to the next level "@rohan barnard also because instead of investigating real crimes Surname id Gupta
Abel Manyedi,the PIC commission always on time nd only take 30 minutes lunch brk where's Zondo commission does s opposite 😀😀 maybe he drives frm KZN t Parktwn every day.... shame our DCJ eish this gonna b boring guys.. where's Mr Maleka
Magda Seguin,I noticed they do the preliminary first before connecting to save broadcast time PIC is not so complicated and vast as the Zondo Commission A certain Mr Panday from KZN will allegedly be mentioned today @welto do you remember that Selebi was Interpol Head @mvubu 1234 yes This man could have been Minister of Police @welton will then be able to trust SAPS The General needs protection after this KZN had many political killings @welton paulse hat is exactly what the ANC want...for people to lose interest so they can continue with their looting "I agree About? Definitely @welton paulse...Danny Jordaan and those bribes paid by SAFA is a huge elephant in the room "The toll roads in Gauteng also needs an investigation The people were never consulted on toll roads "@welton paulse Its never easy I realised how the novices in the audience trying to ask questions as professionals struggle...it's a learning curve Ms September is doing well Burgers Park hotel owned by the ANC I was told that by someone at the hotel when we had a conference there. Yes...at one particular international confrrence We were told beforehand that there will be heightened security only to find out that Selebi and Interpol also had a meeting there. Selebi used to be a regular guest "@rohan barnard Brexit is a mess @rohan barnard don't forget the abuse of females in churches All done under the banner of freedom of religion The Catholic church has been invaded by a group delivery to break it down from the inside...I have not yet read the complete documents but it is paedophiles that become priests lasting a century @welton paulse exactly why do a minister need 8 bodyguards and including their deputies.And those blue lights!! I am Catholic practicing ALL churches stem from the Catholic church I am not upset...there is a lot I don't agree with Novice not amateur...there is a difference I also think that the modern evangelicals are hideous...they also exploit their people @rohan barnard me too R15m for police accommodation? Imflated invoices...it only cost R33k You will regret it Thank you @Gee J this disrespectful behaviour pops up all the time giving all men a bad rap What about the Watson's? @Melvict Melbourne A block is coming up "And want about KPMG Judging from the infantile conversation on this forum I deduct that some Says are not ready for democracy accountability yet. *SOME SOUTH AFRICANS The serious criminality of the ANC is flagrantly being addressed by someone who was smeared with lies is ignored for those who have the privilege to listen but they are wasting it with nonsense talk @BOBBY DCJ does that all the time to give perspective...it's his job The literacy rate in SA is compounded by the high school dropout rate(StatsSA) millions compatriots don't have the luxury to grasp or understand this commission that is why the ANC will win I meant the LOW literacy rate
Desmond Masilela,Last time she was bit nervouse. I think today she will be much better. Here start a problem with files If the chair is transparent it shouldn't be a problem for the chair to listen to his brother implicates. @Felix Muyoba. What are you thinking Felix😁 @Felix Muyoba. No wonder this country was like this😂 Are they showing us a slide of 1976 or 1994? When they talk about 1976 police I get very angry about it. anyway its now the new era. I will just swallow my pride and move forward. @Felix Muyoba. Will do so. but it seems like the man is going to tell us about the news of 1976. @digitalemotionfilms. Show me one police ppl who where not bad at that time? @digitalemotionfilms. I would like to tell you more about the police of that time but i dont want to. Because some of our fellow brothers died because of those police man. @digitalemotionfilms.. 🖐 It was not The chair is coughing heavy I've got some flu medication with me. Can someone come and get it for the chair please. @Sthakathi Khumalo 😂😂😂😂😂 @Norman Zwane 😂😂😂😂 @Lucky123 Thwala. So what need to be done. Must he consult?
Edwin Arthur,Maleka is our man confusion in the camp
Thabiso Dikolomela,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 direng di Z mo baneng A petty one
Aniceth De Missamou,"Why so much distrust on the lady "Okay "If Zondo has to correct her all the time "Just like they prep a witness b4 the testimony "If it's was a Trial "Born as Policeman @welton paulse please give the sister a chance to shine "Guys for the sake of the Commission @welton paulse I dnt believe she was nt prepared bt she's either nt confident as the nation is watching which can lower your confidence. "@Michael Wild if there's commission abt the 2010 WC @Derek Main people in the Cell phone industry who have info of wrong doing should approach the Commission Under JZ everyone in a position of command believed they could do as pleased and get away with it since the head was rotten. The banks were at the Commission bt just to explain why they closed the Gupta's Bank Accounts. "Shame Thanks @Cassius Mngomezulu ouch
rohan barnard,Another admin flaw form an advocate.... This is so familiar from* "Is she not supposed to add the title? Mr. McBride She seems disrespectful "See It's just plain basic professionalism. Anyone on here that knows what's going on with the Packham case? @Magda Seguin the hotel in Pretoria? "@Desmond Masilela I am only 29 years old @S Nompozolo Duduzane? "@Musa Bakiti true... Look at the USA @S Nompozolo oh no! Hopefully she is out of this mess. 😞 @Musa Bakiti don't even get me started on churches. Those are the biggest bigots ever. Abusing religion to fill their own pockets and not even pay tax on that huge income. "@S Nompozolo hopefully she didn't leave you behind. I'm so sorry bro. 😞 Stories like these @Magda Seguin churches are just one big orgy. Look at all the sexual abuse claims against the ministers and popes And none of those cases gets anywhere. MTN is way too expensive @Magda Seguin my personal opinion is that 99% of the administration of the catholic church is sexual predators. Indians always have the best hair! The catholic church should be abandoned @Magda Seguin I am sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. But there's a lot evil going on in the Vatican and churches world wide @Magda Seguin I know that. But that's why most of them went their own way and doesn't associate themselves with the catholic church "@Magda Seguin the biggest issue I have with churches in the modern times is the way that the Bible's wording changed at least once a year "@Magda Seguin and also that churches seems to kind of expect you now to give them more money than you can even afford. Where is the times when churches lived by the Word by saying ""come as you are""" You have to dress a certain way now ( the more fashionable the better) @Matthew Adams I believe that there was a few writers and translators involved @Matthew Adams I recently watched a documentary and that the book of Mary Magdalene was discovered but was left out just because she is a woman 😒 Oh no. Luckily I blocked Fils so I don't see that racist comments. DCJ can I bring you a Strepsil? @Norman Zwane you killed me with that comment! 😂🤣😂🤣 "@Naledzani Mashau if he needs alcohol @Naledzani Mashau 😂🤣😂 "@Mikey Pie No @Norman Zwane STOP! You gonna get me in ICU next to DCJ !! 😂😂😂😂😂 Justice Zondo is a very clever man. He helped form the CCMA

Wildthing,WC 2010 needs it's own enquiry. lots went missing in that time. and they build white elephant stadiums and could have just renovated the current stadiums. some places needed new stadiums because they did not have . but money was wasted or went into pockets Judge Zonda is great linking the dots what's the full name of the business man owe no is Fils back. block him and save yourself from a heart attack. Thanks "ha ha he has a helicopter so true and the newspaper started reporting way back in 2015 and SARS or PP did not look into them. shows the divergence of government departments guys don't get carried away remember #meto and show respect just block Fils he is a nut job and makes trouble each say. think he is one of Zuma's sons the details coming out now will lead to some more assassinations of police that took part and have details and will talk if not removed. which company did the catering at that party

Agreed. Doesn't matter if the transgressor are white black pink or purple. Put them in jail @Norman Zwane But there are groups in South Africa that our proud of their Bantu heritage and refer to it as Bantu all the time. Hope im not offending anyone...

"Norman And the seagull's name was Nelson "Norman The Romans perfected the production of wheat. I'm not one for titles.

Alexander Dowding,Justice Zondo has the most soothing voice to listen to. It makes me feel so relaxed that I struggle to stay awake. He should narrate audio books. Zondo must keep interjecting 300000 Zimbabweans came into South Africa last year. Only around 80000 were found by Home Affairs to have legitimate and legal travel documentation. Says all you need to know about Zimbabwean economy I bet not a single implicated person from this inquiry will land up in jail. Watch the space 🙄 @Gee J it is nothing more than a whitewash. They cannot prosecute + send anyone to jail coz most of them have dirt on each other that would be exposed. Classic house of cards. Remove 1 rest will fall
Sanele Mabaso,Malema is our leader whether you like it or not "say what you like about him  "Agreed Louw """"""""Malema for President""""" "why economy become the centre issue here?? that is exactly failed CODESA talk  @Musa we are ready for JUJU those who anti-him they must seek asylum somewhere because Juju is the son of the soil !!!!!!#08 May 2019 is the final @Cameroon yes we in the EFF we want white as long as they are prepared to share the land and behave like visitors not like Verwoed !!!! @Cameroon your views sound like you are Oranian bru !! @Gee J since it was fought we are ready to revisit the fight Cameroon you are the remaining racist ! I don't have tym for racist I need JUJU !!!!! All these racist with Juju & BLF are going to be talk how to behave especially if you are visitors @Cameroon you are true Oranian so why should I bother with racist young boy? @Musa you are correct AWB is represented by Cameroon @Cameroon u smell like a racist bruh Yeah ANC is corrupt but Juju is our choice As EFF we will start our expropriation project with Orania @Cameroon we will expropriate Cameroon including his dogs en underwears
Wandile Ranuga,is this a festival of confessing and walking away or
