Wildthing,Yebo look at the majors nice Gold watch now he is looking shocked Zonda is getting upset please ask him how he went from non commission officer to officer right to the pointn point Judge Zonda is correct. if the author is not there to state where he got his evidence then it cant be used. but does not mean it is nit true or correct. The book just opens your eyes. if.it was not true why is there not 100s of cases of the author been sued. makes you think it was a reference only on rumours The Major can sue the author if it is fails The poor Judge he listens 2 times. once in aMaZulu then English and it probably changes in between "name
makhosi nobhatyi,Evidence was layed b4 you major general Interpretation yabhuda Request not report Real mabena @legae nyalungu Mojar General came with his father as interpreter 😂😂😂 DCJ kubo that has nothing to do with agreement "Alright this guy can write English Hayi interpreter phandle we have people in the commission 🤦‍♀️😃😃😂😂@thando Nkutha Quiet interpreter the guy can hear I don’t trust this document should be legitimate @spider I agreed with you The man is laying now This man is a trustworthy person to defend president "DCJ becoming serious now Counselor is out not even getting involved question 🤷🏾‍♀️ she must go Hoffmeyor take over Why you give the number if you are not satisfied? Interpreter please shut up This guy must be fired Van zyl will be testifying? Is anyone whom higher than you at soldiers when you are not satisfied? Anyone higher than you sir can do something you are not happy to do will you just do it because they say do it 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️
Tulani Tulz,molo iStulo masithethe isiZulu qha "Uyabonakala ukuba lixoki ne menene lomfo  "uMajor makamxele u number 1 lol zondo: ndikufumene😂 lixoki lomfo 😂😂😂 Hayi noba ngunyana ka ka number 1 lo andimqhondi 😂😂😂 lol The power of number 1 great 😂😂😂😂
Thulani Bukani,sounds lovely in Zulu You can hear the interpreter likes brandy Is it not frustrating for Zondo to speak English when he can perfectly communicate with the gentleman in vernacular. @Tulani Tulz exactly gama lam bendizbuza iSiberia ingena phi why can't senior people speak in their native tongue Fred? Bathabile Dlamini did it in her inquiry You may be on to something because Bathabile clearly had something to hide @Bronx Wavy 😂🤣😂 im dead I've been blocking and reporting this guy finally chair. tell him in Zulu
carnoth ngomane,Lost in translation its getting hot now
Legae Nyalungu,This interpreter is slowly becoming a Mabena the interpreter needs an interpreter himself "The way the DCJ is dealing with the junior evidence leaders is ruthless😂😂miss September non verbal or note verbal deny deny deny third force😰isandla sesithathu dCJ not entertaining hearsay hostile witness😂
Ewald Kruger,Special Needs Major. Earning R400k a year hehehehe. 😀 @Sibonelo Khumalo. Interruptor indeed.
Khaya Nomoyi,"They must change this interpreter.Can you imagine this in a criminal case when the lawyer They must play the audio recordings if they are not destroyed. This interpreter is killing the flow of evidence and the adv is not systematic how is she leading this evidence.Can see she is holding the documents now. In the army you comply and complain later unless the order is illegal.The Col said to him the President knows about this thats why he complied as well as the email from Mr koloane. "Right judge Hostile witness. Two ranks inbetween. These juniors are giving Zondo tough time as he has to ask questions himself to get clarity.
PETER STAFFEN,they can always get somebody else to listen in at later stages
clive oconnell,Nearly Gold watch Gives orders on Amazon translations
Yanela Nokhele,I find myself assisting the interpreter 😂
Lee D. Hendrix,...Breach of the National Security by Presidential Authority 101 "...He is obligated to Military Code of Law and Conduct "...He must follow Orders from a Superior Officer ...Here is the Interjection of Authority(President). ...At this point the Officer is being persecuted for an obligation to Military Codes of Conduct.

Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Auto-correct needs an interpreter. @Bronx Wavy Spot on note verbal "@Felix Muyoba Non-commissioned officer eg. corporal Yes - a medic @Khulubuse Z Are you THE Khulubuse Zuma? "@@Khulubuse Z In that case @@Khulubuse Z OK - when's the big day? "@@Khulubuse Z The problem is He must still explain how he became a Major so quickly. Seems like he was promoted for his role in this debacle. Many of the things Myburgh wrote about we already had a fair idea they were happening. Yep - the fall guy @Ibo Thabo Yes - exactly. He hasn't answered that question. @Felix Muyoba The question still remains regardless of the book. @Tsepang Ranneileng But they shoyldn't follow orders from someone outside the military. @Tsepang Ranneileng Now you are getting closer to the truth of it. Nobody wants to say it though. @Khulubuse Z Pay your workers what they're due. @Khulubuse Z You must go to jail for your crimes. You're part of the state capture rot. @Dominic Przybylski It's the ANC way. This week I think @Ibo Thabo Infroming people they will be implicated by witnesses testimony. @Ibo Thabo For Kolwane
Thapelo Motabogi,😂😂😂😂
Sibonelo,They must just change the interrupter @FredBKevin 😂😂😂

dominic mabe,this interpreter he is too slow he also forgot some of the words
FredBKevin,Senior ppl insisting on doing the discussion in a language other the English always has something to hide or cover up Zuma will do his in Zulu also They can but they senior enuf to also do it in a language that all of mzansi understand Yes but she is a special kind of incompetence He is a major general he understands English and can speak it His phone is English But I agree I guess it is his democratic right so be it . Now that im a major i can push back lolzer hahahaha hahahaha he is proper bullet proof vested with his laywer entourage tactic and this guy was promoted
Sbusiso Mabura,Labantu bazdidekele nje😂 😂 yes Thando hey Just live the guy alone😏
Kevin Simon,"Zuma did not need an interpreter in parliament Non verbal as used here is not even English Must have Latin origins. "King Zuma Hmmm. is this a gotcha moment? Now he doesn't need the interpreter. Statement was a lie or transcription wrong. "It's easy Three ranks Agreed Call Myburg So you can ignore military structures in favour of DIRCO Should court marshall this guy. Took orders from DIRCO What happened at the NURENBURG trials t the Germans after WWII Van Zyl was told after the fact if I understood correctly
Sofia Sofia,This one has criminal written all over him - I am judging this BOOK alrite !!! AND WHY IS HE LISTENING TO HIS TRANSLATOR SO INTENSELY ? This one knows exactly what he is doing ! SNEAKY ....you know what ! @SABC Digital News please block Cllick Here Fulll Here Fulll Heree Clickk Heree So you telling me he spoke to Van Zyl in Zulu too ? and everyone else Went to a Zulu School ?

A Crystal Ball will give us more satisfying answers ! it was enough with this now witness
Nelson Musoliwa,This witness is stressed because of lies he has to sustain. Ask him whether he experience such a situation before of allowing private landing without note berbal This landing of Gupta landing is all about NO 1 as Tonny even told B Martin that they are Zuma guests This debacle will embarrass this country for many yrs to come; a chief military airbase like this one; mere because he is a Zulu i think Knowledge is power the witness leader is not enjoying her time here as is the witness No doubt this guy is in Zuma train That is why he is so evasive and closed with evidences; promoted Tou break protocol on Zuma side you get promotion for you have taken it that you protect him
Zama Kubheka,non verbal non verbal in Zulu lol ai inkinga le non verbal izinqinamba these ppl @thandeka precious ai ai ai when u are from JHB ull say izinto eziWrong

Ibo Thabo,I did it over 2 00 times @Khulubuse Z why should I shut-up BUT NOT YOU? @Khulubuse Z why don’t you shut-up? But why this witness not explained how he got promoted from the position he had to the one he got after that plane incident? I think he was asked but just ignored or played. He deliberately ignored or played with the question and I am sure he knew about the book. @Felix Muyoba but there have to be follow up on what he is here for "With the previous witness today she said ""they did listen some telephone conversations"" by people who were discussing the authorisation Rule 33 is what? @Derek Main thanks and that white boy is a lawyer for who? @Dominic Przybylski ok thank you all "The ANC have huge responsibility to stop presenting useless persons to lead us then trigger nepotism
KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,This guy seem to exudes some kind of Zulu/Xhosa language mix. @Zama Kubheka Yeah Non-verbal LOL "@Zama Kubheka Meaning @Spider Smell a rat as he was sitting on that hot seat. @MJ Mogopa Keke These guys are just here to distract @Spider I was suspicious of this guy from onset.... his echo-posture communicated some meanings to me Suspicious character "@MJ Mogopa Keke I said it from onset LOL.

Mogorosi Moremedi,😂 where is the Volume?
Thandeka Phakathi,jeeez Zama ulimi lwezigodi alufani
MJ Mogopa Keke,This interpreter 😨😨😨haaikona "This a Major in the army  Is he saying the inquiry transcript is wrong? He is lying under oath and he is going to fall hard judge is going to catch him He is now in a cage😨 The judge does not play.try somewhere major The army does not take orders from Kholoane Court Marshall him!
Mahlomola Blou,u r right spider y mare mare this thing it's embarrassing to his children indeed how he became a senior while he can't read English or speak
Diana Sekatane,how did he qualify as major? was he deployed to the job? it now make sense. deny deny..... chickens are coming home to roast. he should have followed the protocol. that is why he was given promotions. @makiwa very correct.
Clive White,"This witness is the scapegoat as ne was a Sgt Maj and would take and execute any order from a higher rank. Even if he disagreed and in exchange he was swiftly promoted to the rank of Major It is not about the language Zondo has just asked the crucial question This is critical response He could not make the decision as he was new in post and would have been guided by the witness "Exactly He can give him his opinion NCO’s are never listened to by higher ranks. And military officers are never listened to by politicians Because they have their own agenda "and. a WO although he is called Sir This is nothing about language listen to what he is saying.. He is worried now. It could be. It does not matter The transcript has been falsified Could be "Zondo Henis the first "He is the first witness to the commission And for that he was swiftly promoted through the ranks. He is the scape goat 100% Zondo wants him to name the person who pressured him "On one side he has Zondo and on the other side his masters He could be disciplined when he gets back to Waterkloof That is the question "No Following orders... Zondo is being disingenuous he wants a name... Some people here clearly have never been in the military.. In any force anywhere in the world That was a lie "He did to a point Probably by military court This now implicates the Indian High COmmissioner for being an accessory. The likely he will be called back. Unless he is posted away from Waterkloof
Mulunghisi Mulunghisi,whose this guy "what position for this guy what position for the guy
Phillip Cwazibe,The interpreter is irritating die moer in. @Hosia Modiga I agree with you. You can hear from his pronunciation. This interpreter is just not speaking isiZulu as he should do.
TG Swartlane,Interpreter 🤔 he’s sometimes doing a direct translation 😂🤣🤣😂😂 This guy
Tsepang R,I won't be surprised if Zuma sits there and testifies in Zulu come the the 15th 😂😂 "@fikile mbokodi that's exactly what soldiers do @Derek Main that someone outside the military was himself taking orders from the commander in chief AKA number 1😂😂 "@Derek Main they've been saying it
Prudence Mokoena,mhhhhh! 😂 😂 Jehofa!🙊 state capture or pure hatred for former President Zuma? 😂 😂😂😂😂
Felix Muyoba,@Clive White what is NCOs? @Derek Main were you a conscript? now he will be caught.. some people like to take us as fools..am sure there are some fools who rushed to go buy the book just to read hearsays and enrich an individual in the process..i will never do that.. bu why he is here is about the landing of the gupta plane not about his position..so zondo is right to brush aside the book
Nyasimi Geoffrey,all this south african lawyers have classes on..they must be very learned from that university called wits transcipt is both in zulu and english deny Deeeeeeennnnnnyyyyyyyyyy Hosia Modiga Please some respect please Telephonically Hosia Modiga you calling this man a fool by speaking his native language SPUTUPUTU what does Sbhudu sbhudu mean ? the is a mojar 3 ranks from warant officer 1 Thank you Khumalo HAHAHHAAHA @Prudence Mokoena Mokoena Do you think is okay to Hate a corrupt man Thank you KEith am watching from Egypt VEry well everything has be adjourned to tomorrow Stupu stupu

Rina Erasmus,"Why appoint someone in a senior position if he can't speak English? Did he always used an interpreter when communicating with people from foreign countries by phone
Sandile Mkhonto,Interpreter is doing the worse The chair must understand that there are staff that above yuour pay grade
jose billa,"this guy is "Yes 
Aniceth De Missamou,"1st of all
Moahi Hlapolosa,Can’t they get better translation This book is now hear say I still have issues with the quality of the investigation Why was the book brought to the commission The author is also not prepared to appear before the commission The guy rehearsed this evidence Zondo is exhausted Lol
Siyabonga Kundayi,I really like the interpreter
Sthakathi Khumalo,Interpreter loools Nyasimi Geoffrey Looos... its means flimsy way Ulahlele amaehlo khona lols... Interpreter why kodw!! Zondo is not entertaining the book hehe Myburg must give eveidence mxm Moahi Hlapolos The3 eveidence provided has not been tested on the book hehe Ndiza mshini lols... iBhanoyi The book has no legal basis for inferences!! Pure hogwash some say 😛
Jacqui Baumgardt,One big eish - he has no idea what Myburgh actually says about him perhaps the sections of the book need to be translated for him Prevarication always means lies me too - I was following orders when I raided the bank the other day - where's my promotion to billionaire? like a hare caught in the headlights "agree 😀 always do the right thing! "agree "Ha-ha
Siyabonga Ngcobo,lobaba kodwa
Wilson Hishono,yhoo lobaba lo
Oupa Dlamini,This chap is lying
khulekani scelo,this interpreter hai
Vincent Maleka,🤔🤔🤔 they almost have him🤔 they must ask him about his promotion 😂 this guy😫
Sibonso Masilela,yes
fikile mbokodi,uthe usangoma wakhe akhulume isizulu lobhuti akajiki lomuntu lomuntu udlala ngathi uyasazi isilungu if they say kill people so you have to follow the command even if you know its wrong woow i give up wooow so that means when you are a soldieer you dont have your own brain
Sensemac4 Maccombel,Phaaa Being caught Reply bra whos that person Yes yes yes ZONDO
Lorna Kavanagh,.... the judge is onto him.
Nndivheni Mabidi,Enter Deputy Chief Justice Zondo!!!
MIKE DURBAN,Bust Boetjie....bust @Derek Main ....spot on Eeeeeesh...this major is sure covering up......another Jacobo fall guy... Yes....Uncle Donad's marines are coming..........
Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,This OKE is he worst soldier in the world - he ignores the rank and file - and listens to outsiders Giving the Col Van Zyl the blame So the senior cleaner at the department of trash can have a plane land in South Africa - just contact Zulu boy and he will organize in zulu Did he blame colonialism? He was never forced - send me an email - I will send you some airplanes and a batajon He is speaking in tongues The magic 8-ball will give better answers Is somebody watching the sub-titles on this - it is hilerious So after all this - did you do it ? The flight was not supposed to land. WHY DID IT LAND THERE? Now the ambassador wants to place position kwenzenjani Dominic Przybylski - enough to change a light bulb Checkers ya all
Dominic Przybylski,Lessons of the Nuremberg trial have been forgotten. Everybody is responsible for their own action. Following orders is not an excuse. SANDF officer material. Yes men get promoted. People with integrity get fired. When is Kolwane going to be on the stand? @Ibo Thabo Rule 33 is notification to a person where evidence by a witness may implicate him. How many generals do we have in SANDF? Heh?
adrian albertyn,"this bloke understands english
Nqobile Ndimande,money changes police orders ayeye poor processes
KQ-O’ American Lady,is he reading?
Lungisile Nonoya,This gentle 'check collector' thinks he will be off the hook. Everyone in the value chain has a role to play. He is stupid and still covering up for whoever. I don't believe this "@Clive White inevitably
Tshegofatso Mngomezulu,the interpreter ke moleko straight So in SANDF all documents are in vernacular since a whole Major can't articulate himself in business language.Or is this a strategy.Great to hear only if the interpreter could do him justice.
Gwandidla Makiwa,"corruption can make you not to decide on your own how on earth could you get that senior position Sergeant Major .....heyi kunzima!!! that's tactically
R hunter,Interpreter sounds like Leon Shuster
