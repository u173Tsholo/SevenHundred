Blakk Dahlyon,Is this a kangaroo court...no justice rendered ?
silas morena,the first people that are guilty must be in jail not politicized every day
Kaizer Tshehla,"Waste of state resources
Eugene Rudman,these spawn of Satan will get what's coming to them
Sal SA,Auditors hide behind disclaimer clause in financial statements and escape sanction if they don't pick up irregularities Blatant omission in not listing irregularities in the audit report. Did management accept that irregularities were present? Were the missing files reported in audit report? He does not know what dereliction of duty means or he's scared to concede Dereliction omission same difference They cost the taxpayer billions - must also face the full might of the law - ie prison
Ghost Mapetla,loop hole bribed the report is was priced listen yoooo
Marcus Mmola,"Accepting responsibility is not enough "the rot knows no boundaries NO REMORSE she knows her craft "We are not known for ethical leadership
Alvino Theunissen,Agree @ Adrian. Was it intentional or unintentional? Agree @ Marcus its a disgrace for other auditors! How can auditors be selective of samples when auditing of discrepancies? lol the Judge/ Chair is Clever catching the auditor! Lol he caught and finally admits his statement is incorrect! PWC auditing team is a big problem? "Whats are with the commission lighting room He stutter when he is in a corner! Mr Pule Mothiba
BOIKANYO MOLOI,eix I find it hard to understand this guy
Noni Mpoza,this guy is lying through his teeth!!!
Sure Sight,What about the horrendous FARM MURDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We need media to show the world what psychotic freaks are doing!!!!!!!!!!
M0REBENG PRINT WORKS,"this guys is not revealing the whole truth instead he is giving criteria of his own work  you are right Mr TQt "mr mothibe is giving all the meanings of every word thrown on him but i believe this lady is coming alright 
Tseliso Ntsepe,He will try to duck and dive but this woman will not leave him alone @Nqobane Mzizi he deliberately messed up for a gain. He got brown envelope
Ridwaan Ismail,morning i agree with Tshepiso he is not telling the whole truth
Fana Nkosi,corruption at PwC white company not only black companies are corrupt PwC captured by dudu myeni never trust auditors with yo money the guy not prepared fo inquiry dont trust auditing firm's pls she's excellent adv
adrian albertyn,caught out. not mis leading but lied.
Peet Venter,uhmmmmm
Nqobani Mzizi,Mr. Mothibe is busted. He didn't do his job propoerly. @Sal Abdulla He is just scared to concede that he messed up. @Theodore John he is BUSTED! I wonder if SAICA and IRBA will deal with him accordingly. "Let's pick it up after tea "I am not sure if the question posed to the auditor is for him to answer. Yes "To what extent does Mothibe or PWC have control/influence on the ""purported unlawful extension"" of the work? Standard practice or experience points to 5 years. I don't get why he is being cornered. ðŸ¤·" It is not as if PWC or Nkonki forced the audit down SAA's throat. "This question must go to SAA's supply chain management. More importantly You trust her after she has roasted you so much. You're gullible. Hahahahahaaaa @Joshua Borias They did work for 5 years. That is not the dispute. The matter is that it is irregular (outside contract). "He is cracking indeed @mkm 23. I feel for him shame. With great reward (pay) comes greater responsibility
Enoch Dipela,Shem...this guy must just tell the truth because he is just trying to run away...
Theodore John,Dereliction of duty presupposes gross neglect whereas an omission might be without a blame worthy state of mind. They probably will. He was never ready lol He went against what was on paper. Meaning the 1 year period indicated on paper was just a sham In essence he took part in misleading the public so as to enrich himself. Now he is blaming it on trade usage. @Mzizi. he knows that she is right lol
Psychonaut,this guy doesn't even believe his own words
James Laurie,Not much of an audit by PWC. They seem to have been afraid to chalenge the SAA board!
Nabtune,who's this guy?
Joshua Borias,"""ADV. HOFMEYER-MISTER MOTHIBE ' WE R GOING NOWHERE SLOWLY""" """ HEY @ PHELADI LAMOLA@HE IS BEEN THROWN UNDER DE BUS OR THEY HAVE RESIGNED""" """ CONTRACT 4 ONE (1) YEAR """ THE HEAD-OFFICES OF COMPANIES LIKE PWC IS OVERSEAS """ NQOBANI MZIZI """LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS A JOINT AUDIT THRESHHOLD BETWEEN PWC & KWINANA AND ASSOCIATES""!!!"
