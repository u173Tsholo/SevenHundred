Zwane did what he did taking orders from Zuma of course Hahaha @venter This is coming to serious now Sakhile that is depending on state agency which failed to investigate Guptas and arrest them while they were here only when they left the country now act as if want to arrest them "Sakhile money was stolen from us as poor people money that was intended to used for service delivery had being used for Gupta account Trevor Rolfe I greed with 100% when it comes to bite to Guptas and Zuma broke Sakhile mtshali you are brainwashed and your argument is baseless and wasting our time Duduzane went to Dubai to hide everything on February he disappeared with Gupta "They bribed these people

TheChannel,You have to remember @Kingsley Mathe that like a tree the roots dont actually connect to the leaves. But the influence is there... Zuma is far from these right now @Kingsley Mathe @gaddafi tshazibane ANC had to be corrupt during apartheid "@Kingsley Mathe​ its okay for even Zuma to hide behind the law procedures but if you can cause amounts of smoke that he has @Kingsley Mathe is your view that there was no corruption? or are u looking at this saying everyone at that level is doing this? "@Kingsley Mathe unfortunately they will not go to Prison @Fils de l'homme that is what the HISTORY of a White person tells u
Creighton Schlebach,@Thando Nkutha ando I think it means Inter-Ministerial Committee in this context There you have it!!! The link between state capture and inequality!
gaddafi tshazibane,anc has been corrupt way back even in exile they were crooks were they will send soldiers inside to buy them crockets and heavy weights
Norman Zwane,@Kingsley Mathe : why is that so important? viz. someone who will say Zuma said this or that to them? @Kingsley Mathe: My queston again. Why is that so important to you? @Kingsley Mathe : Those are not the terms of reference of this inquiry but whatever floats your boat
Millicent Shozi,"fils your you still here fooling around

I'll come unarmed. @Mosimanegape Bapo I'm giving you the opportunity of a lifetime. Please accept my offer. @Mosimanogape Bapo I'm giving you the opportunity to kill me. please meet me at your closest SAPS office. @Mosimanogape Bapo I want you to kill me as you said you want to do. Why are you backing off? @Welton Paulse I remain white. "I'm very happy with Malema's announcement that whites will also get land because SA belongs to all who live in it. I've never owned property and can now take part in ""illegal"" land occupation." "ALL govt officials should be forced to only use public institutions like hospitals ALL govt official should be forced to only use public transport. ALL govt officials should be forced to live in squatter camps. It is the fastest way to improve living conditions. ALL govt officials must be forced to buy their food from street vendors. It will grow the economy very fast. ALL govt officials must be forced to only drink tap water. SA will then have the best quality fresh water.
Mosimanegape Bapo,@Fils de l'homme noo you are listening to these things of the white lies. Venezuela is the biggest economy on the planet "I will only vote for the CIC or Thuma Mina "@Lorna Kavanagh aii this white arrogance @Fils de l'homme because you have cursed us with a smallanyana white witchcraft of poverty @Fils de l'homme they give us a nice tshikipa for voting "eish ja neh "@Peet Venter you racist "@Fils de l'homme thats where we get our power "@Peet Venter eish this one "@Spinderella yes brother @Peet Venter you must go to the europ police station @jenelle chetty land "@Fils de l'homme we have the highest "@welton paulse yes tell this old racist We wuz the kangz @Jackson Mpala just go vote DA like all the other cleva blacks only black people who benefited from apartheid and think they are fancy vote DA

"Thwala! those are adults university students "Sakhile "mtshali! and you can look straight into the eyes of a white boy who irritates you and tell him FU "can he also tell us schebach! we then agree that state was captured prior to 94 for inequality ran deep between color lines? louw! Is that the reason why land was captured from African ancestors? was motivated such move? Rolfe! let's live it to both nguni and koikoi to clear. What we know is that those of us with brighter complexion were not part of this continent
Onsen Zivavose,the state capture inquiry is the waste of state resources. the fact of which they go such a long process is an obviously and that need all this commission of inquiry while the country is under crisis.

Charles Nkadimeng,all rise
sakhile mtshali,These banks are acting with impunity! we are not safe. I thought they will detail that trail of money being looted but they colluded to close account based on unfounded media report "there decided to affect 1000s of jobs based on unproven reports Stephanie Martins this is commission that is probing transaction follows "Yes I'm yet to see evidence of follows of billions allegedly stolen by the Gupta "The Guptas did take the banks to court Where is the evidence? "Lets not be emotional where is the evidence? i ask again "show me bank statements "nonsense "that is a lie show me the evidence of State Capture! are you awere the PP found no wrong doing in Estina? "Lets not be emotional Non of you can provide evidence that will stand in court. the journo that leak the emails is not testifying So was Thuli This Thando person is blinded by fake news We should have the Guptas behind bars by now if there was evidence @Thando Nkutha you are being childish . you are failing to prove proof and getting emotional @nhlayisi owen magayisa amandla "Just listen to these banks "How can say there was money looted when the Banks dont have that money We cant hear what was suspicious transactions that these companies where involved in. what is the crime @Michael Wild There is no proof of Gupta involvement there @Michael Wild "What is worry is we hear no detail what was laundered "If there was something "We know that Trevor Manual intervened in the appointment of Des Van Rooyen "@makhosi nobhatyi are you not aware of the meeting between CR @makhosi nobhatyi what is wasting time is listening to these banks lie that there was no colluding I'm yet to hear a sound argument to prove Zuma wrong on his definition of the state @peter pott is leadership what are you waiting for @Kingsley Mathe Its no enough to accuse him of handing the state to the Guptas without proving it beyond doubt "@Andrew Mc Farlane  @Street Cred is have not heard or seen evidence so far. If we can take Jonas to court he will not be about to prove the meeting too place "@Andrew Mc Farlane my mother was earning salve wage as a domestic worker what evidence sir ? i never accused anyone of State Capture "Are you suggesting i prove that it was not capture @Andrew Mc Farlane? that is easy
Andrew Mc Farlane,Msholozi will say this guy is misinformed... is captured @sakhile mtshali define impunity @sakhile mtshali I thinnk you should testify with all your evidence. @sakhile mtshali Im sure the Guptas also wonder what happened to all the money they looted from and subsequently burnt to build Duduzane's house etc in India and the UAE.... Only after a court case will the evidence be shown in public. Well then the corruption of the Apartheid times should be exposed. @peter pott what is your point? @sakhile mtshali just to be clear.. please define evidence @peter pott I ask what your race connotation is all about @sakhile mtshali just watch the commission..... plenty of evidence. If you cant see it then turn it off and have some lunch @sakhile mtshali people provided accounts under oath. It can be used in a court so it can be regarded as evidence @sakhile mtshali provide evidence to the list @sakhile mtshali yes the captured PP... The one who is a spy... the Zuma lacky @sakhile mtshali can you prove the ANC government has improved the quality of education for the poor since 1994? "@sakhile mtshali @sakhile mtshali and what do you define as normal? Someone who has open eyes and ears? Someone who can rationally think about information? "@sakhile mtshali if you consider the testimony of Mentor as well as Jonas @sakhile mtshali where is your evidence? @sakhile mtshali your testimony my brother.... @Kingsley Mathe of course. Living on a closed island may help... @sakhile mtshali but at the same time you are denying that state capture exists... you have not shown conter arguments to the testimonies @Kingsley Mathe just state what you need help on and I can assist "@sakhile mtshali prove that Eskom @Ewald Kruger he must be in the minerals dept and was left over after Zwane left I think our country is unique so we will have to work it out on our own
Stephanie Martins,Sakhile Mtshali i think you should listen to the testimonies again. you miss the part of bank client confidentiality. you and me are a 3rd parties as a result we are not privvy to that info. If the Gupta owned companies felt that the banks colluded they should have approach the courts. Not approach Jacob Zuma. Sakhile Mtshali some of us see it.
Nelson Musoliwa,What do these graphic illustration about state capture say to Zuma? Does he even understand when they say enablers of state capture. Waht a shame my former president
Wildthing,Sakhile wake up. there is one house in Dubai worth $46.000.000 all click on Fils de ľhomme and report it is a Gupta. trying to turn people against each other. "Sakhile they will start to ask the question on why 4 ministers went to Dubai in one week including Zuma for no real country reason. the answer they carried cash that will come out later And by taking 20% ftomeach contract like new trains that don't fit. but commission paid outside SA. Not paying Tax. moving it out of the country starts to weaken the country too. block fils "I work in company and need to report any gift over R500.00 to the compliance officer. if I don't I am fired. that could mean anything like sports tickets we know before 94 many things where run bad. But wil we in 2018 and have new rules to prevent going back and should also lock down Goverment right too. He just has. by explaining how changing ministers is part of State capture. finance minister comes to mind as one. No thanks Jack don't want jail time when it falls apart jacks that leads to corruption. that's why we here jacks an honest business person. Ha ha too late he is going down
Sthakathi Khumalo,"But Sakhile is right
Mike Cope,"Zondo is a great jurist This guy and his colleagues have been studying State Capture for years and in many countries. What he has to say is very interesting to me.
Mbongweni J.S.S,are u guys listening /watching the witnessing guy or u just fighting over-nothing ?
Lowkey Apparel,BORING!!!
nhlayisi owen magayisa,"Evidence is with ANC they must come and testify "I think it is important to be consistency with the matter at hand Agree 100% Food parcels.. Don't generalize on your narative. There are prominent black leaders with integrity... Guys let us not entertain people who are racist.. @Fils de l'homme.. what have you smoke again.... lol
Trevor Rolfe,why is this guy talking ? @sakhile mtshali Estina Dairy Farm! @sakhile mtshali eskom Brian Molefe 30million rand pension pay out for 18 Months work "lol! Our current Public protecor was appointed by JZ..... Tom Moyane "Those emails are irrelevant  Flashy cars! big banners! Local Artists at rallys The NPA was captured... they have no bite to their bark. Eskom is using emergency procurement procedures and its costing them a lot more due to the lack of proper management WEEDS LEGAL!!!! Wooohoooo!!!!! @Fils de l'homme Thats RAcist and not true at all! Not sure where your from but it seems your upbringing has skewed your view on race. I did @Fils de l'homme blah blah blah! How far back are we going to go???? does the Nguni Have rights to the land or are the Koi koi entitled to the land... technically Loooong time before my gran was alive... id say at least two to three generations ago... I really do not know @Greg Stewart 😞 why? lol @Jackson Mpala please explain how Zuma is Innocent Concourt he was found to have broken his oath of office to protect the constitution of our land Then you can believe what you want Zuma is very Smart! No Doubt! So are the others implicated.

iliketowatchducks,ignore the morons.
thubalethu,@Trevor Rolfe did you go to that school where the main war cry was Agelop Agelop?
Mutumwa Mawere,State capture - in what form does a state exist and what would capturing it entail. Is it the capture of the person of Zuma or a generic state?
Motopi Seleka Jr,#Shakile has a point the former PP' state of capture report makes a lot of allegations instead of findings..... the very report suggested that we should have this current inquiry which legal it too is an investigation exercise - but it too appears to be making allegations instead of answers the PP thought will be found in it. this Inquiry is overrated
ntselelechesa,I think Kaufmann is undermining our thinking capability; Countries in transition can invite the investors in a transparent way through their legitimate channels - FDI. Like he said I think he is not aware of and/or studied our current matter regarding STATE CAPTURE; ZUMA and his cohorts misdirected public funds to fraudsters for his indirect benefit through his son We would not have any problem if Guptas were here as investor without using the powerful STATESMAN - apex of our governance.
KT M,"Not semi desert 
Lucky123 Thwala,"SAOE can perform very well if we deploy competent people not thieves Zuma goes around and mislead student that there is no state capture

RJ Pebane,"just when is the gentleman going to be interrogated...?! he has been talking non-stop
Greg Stewart,SA = freebies and corruption nguni and bantu stole land from koi koi and san people - how far back do we go maybe the world should have exchange of prisoners - all africans to africa and all europeans to europe - really???? phew!!! 😂😂💦💦😂😂 "zulus zuma told students that he doesnt know about state capture it is an attempt to discredit him - hawu??? oh jackie jack?? jack daniels jacki coke gentleman jack jack and the beanstock jack be nimble jack be quick jack jump over the candlestick go jacki - go jacki
Martin Motloung,"I agree with you michael
michelle louw,"The research shows state capture and weakening of property rights go together. No surprises that as state capture becomes stronger
Melvict Melbourne,pott! was that now before 1652 or early 1800 Greg...as far back as when it is to the benefit of the local African The only thing Zuma is innocent on is been born a thief...that s his parents fault. Jackson must be one of Jacob's street kids "Jackson slim vang sy baas "Jack Corruption is a Western concept. Petrol is so expensive we'll have to crowd fund it I have a couple turtles and I have named one Zuma
Linda Damons,"according to the history ive read and to my understanding land trade was done back in the days and yrs before our grandparents were born @trevor 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 yes zuma will deny state capture coz he can't spell state capture
Bsz Amalgamation,But yes he is inocent
Andre van Zyl,Jackson Mampara yes mampara Or he is a BLF member...
Athmanand Singh,Innocent until proven guilty Some if not all members of the Ruling Party had some knowledge of The GUPTAS therefore they intervened when the Banks closed their accounts
Kevin Davis,of corz Jacob Zuma is innocent the and have been asked many times what he did wrong and not even rhamaphosa can pinpoint a single failure and he has never ever been to court on a single state capture charge and Jacob hardly knew the Gupta s it's all a lie lol even nkandla is a lie there is no such place it's all lies Jacob is a victim and his son lives in a little apartment in Soweto not dubai Jackson may I ask u a question what level of education have you got lol dis you get past grade 3 like Jacob Jackson you should get a job in the London paladium telling jokes Jackson u r the only guy here with a bit of brains everyone else has plenty
John Ruiters,Didn't know u stil get such stupid people who don't believe
