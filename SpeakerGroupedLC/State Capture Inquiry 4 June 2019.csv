Rushay Booysen,No matter SABC sold some of its content for so cheap. the commission must look into Hlaudi with that regards as well. incompetence Hlaudi @Magda Seguin Zuma put all his foot soldiers in charge for a reason. @Thando Nkutha he is indeed a man with principle. Gigaba "There should be mass incarceration like what happened in Brazil of these politicians "We can't blame the Guptas when we got such gullible leaders @Thando Nkutha yup Gigaba "@Thando Nkutha it also shows you the greed @Zikhona Zondani not sure what you mean by digging his grave cos he is very credible there no graves to dig but the Guptas and Zuma's
ThandoAM Xaba,I bought his book last year and read it.😌😃 "Indentured "I don't have an eBook Cool. I believe Sundarum.👀🤷‍♀️
Sophia Maholela,"@ThandoAM Xaba  cool "@AnneM
Solly 12,ThandoAM Xaba can you send it to me I need to read that book 📖 ThandoAM Xaba I’ll be visiting the book shop Adv Norman seats in the Judicial Service Commission Best quote from Zuma “I can’t go to the inauguration I’m busy trying to stay out of jail” Sipho cebo all we need is someone who is going to start singing from inside the ANC Magda Saguin I what u mean but I feel like there’s a lot of information we are not getting here His hair is alive
Thulani Timile,This is a bloody disgrace
SONGEZO MNCOKO,when is the big tsotsi/Zuma coming
Gontse D Melesi,SABC is outdated and run by dinosaurs who are stuck in the stone-age methods of doing business. Welcome to RSA disappointment is our daily bread.
Zee Zondani,can they also talk about the selling of government and state owned enterprise jobs. from transnet to governement departments keep on mentioning zume here..... he knows where we live 😂😂😂😂😂 @Solly 12 😂😂😂 best one indeed "This fella keeps digging himself into a grave with his statements "his testimony has a lot of red flags Yu akambi bawo @Mzalwane Mzala 😂😂😂 these people are so childish 😂😂😂😂 they are talking about a haircut now on what channel on tv does this show? "leave the man alone please thats a men this is so childish. lets leave him alone😂 "no wonder they are adjourning
Leadership Exclusive,zumaristo when is zuma coming here
Tobo Lwandile,nor wonder sabc is in this mess
Magda Seguin,Zuma put Hlhaudi in charge of the SABC for a reason I know "Tge Gioras are SA citizens now Sorry for the typos....**the Guptas *India don't want the Guptas back there I'm not scared of Carl Niehaus in his PEP camouflage uniform😂 You can even get camouflage at Guess stores He has hypertension too COPE question in parliament "There are others who will attest to what he is saying The lead advocate is brilliant "He had to submit an affadavit as a witness "Some people call brave whistleblowers liars..go figure Paid trolls and bots I saw in Twitter that Zuma was asked by the commission to come and testify in July but his lawyers wrote a complicated denial....same Stalingrad tactics we are used to "The Zuma acolytes are busy on Twitter asking whatabout Gordhan The country is in the brink of bankruptcy yet they still defend the Chief Thief Some are so stupid to think that SOMANY people just made up stories to implicT implicate Zuma If one reads and listens to their nonsense I swear they think it is a huge conspiracy "Listen to the NPA press conference with Batohi and Cronje here on YT Yes exactly..the NDPP explained everything Ms Batohi said that the corruption in SA is of endemic proportions @Anne M Tge NDPP said they are busy with the biggest and most I.portant cases first.Remember they are also getting rid of the bad apples "Please listen to the YT video of her press conference @Solly 12...so many within parliament already did..just go back on YT to see the testimony of the ex SCOPA chair Every whistleblower who testified told about the victimization and toxic work environment Sundaram is getting fed up It's terrible being made out to be a liar They must show their faces at the commission and stop writing affadavits to be read "Thank you Sir They will say the cameras did not work...baskets They KNEW they were coming...jirre this is disgusting "I think forthwith nobody would want to whistleblower "Agrizzi was robbed and attacked at a garage last week I am surprised at Judge Zondo's attitude towards the witness "@ACBN stop being snobbish And TRUE🤗 Institutional knowledge was he sent by the Guptas? I'm already getting the gist of what is happening here @Muriel Haynes SABC Where is this going to?the advocate did not give an intro at all "@Spykerhond must be SABC HR I bet that the archives was sold by Hlhaudi as was published in MSM @Robert Russell most SAs are bigoted and racist Disgraceful @Ben Cole judgemental as only SAs can be As I said before he has institutional knowledge...I am sure whoever's replaced him dont come near to his knowledge "Naeem Howa Do I sense a bad mood? Tge Judge seems to be in a bad mood It was a newspaper headline he is talking about He was called to testify about the sale of archive footage to ANN7 "Dint talk nonsense
Robert Russell,Zondo should start targeting the Zuma foot soldiers That's cheating skipping pages..... Judge In 1995...... when he joined..... the SABC was profitable...... since then the ANC destroyed a world wide broadcaster as they did ESKOM..... SAA.... DENEL....etc. You bunch of judgmental bigots....... he was a SABC employee who unlike your cadres.... did NOT STEAL from his employer.... @Magda Seguin @tabze @Ben Cole ....100% You would want Scott in your company if you were not being managed by corrupt ANC cadres....
Small Pumpkin Herbz,Zuma was so hellbent in taking this country to the clearner
Lew464,"SABC why so much criticism against this guy? And this coming mostly from people who are black! What a nerve! "Colin Katzen 
Sihle Mthiyane,wenzeni uZuma Pep sells camo ?
Nelson Musoliwa,Madam evidence leader is competent and confident and smart Kanti what happened so far to the suspended secretary of this zondo commission? Thando may be the streets are right has Pravin issued statement concerning these resignations yet? No arrests because our law enforcement agencies are in bad shape as destroyed by zuma crap Facts are did meetings 4 of them with zuma happened Chris Zondo is being bit naive he must be knowing that no one was held responsible for Waterkloof saga
Jean-Pierre Le Roux,"Soooooooo "Rajesh Sundaram has bad teeth for a millionaire
Lucky123 Thwala,then stupid people supporting a thief Zuma in his currupt cases after all this

Hamza Gujjar,masibulele masbu you basted
Mzalwane Mzala,Taxman guns for Bosasa boss Gavin Watson (News24) The Guptas had no love for South Africa South Africa has an independent judiciary that will not allow people to be jailed without following proper processes @carnoth ngomane Without an independent judiciary you become a proper banana republic Without an independent judiciary all the cases that the DA and the EFF won against government and parliament would not have been possible. Without an independent judiciary the constitutional court would not have ruled that reports of the public protector and binding Without an independent judiciary former president Zuma would not have paid anything towards the Nkandla costs @carnoth ngomane Who are those individuals and what did they do? @carnoth ngomane I have been following it. I hope you know that the NPA is not part of the judiciary @carnoth ngomane The judiciary proved to be the light in the dark days of a captured government Will the Christian ATM keep Manyi when all his misdemeanors are exposed? @carnoth ngomane I forgive you for thinking that the judiciary includes the prosecutors I think he is a joiner He found the organisation on its way @Zolisa Memani Courts do not investigate. They adjudicate @Zolisa Memani The Special Investigative Unit (SIU) has been empowered to deal with corruption Haybo @Zikhona Zondani ndiyanqanda!
hilton modike,why is gigaba not arrested by now if it was at Rwanda all this people will b in jail .a democratic state like south Africa having to deal with lawlessness @thando nkutha may be u can school me with process becos the guptas are gone & they told us that we are screwed becos they won't come back cos they don't trust the law which was easily broken by them duduzane is living large with our money in Dubai the same money which he could have invested in a country where he stole it from .Dubai is developing through our money
Dams daily motivations Madamalala,Zuma then now
Slindile Ngcobo,please refer to Zuma as NO.9 for this hearing p82 @MARUMO SEGOPOTSO MABALANE ...Zuptoid sold OUR country...His is nKandla
Lorna Kavanagh,SAA ceo resigned because he has received no support and was indermined by managers. So it seems like the bad people are still in SAA. SAA is in such a bad way.... like Eskom That is what the CEO said ...
Cerebis,Just tuned in.....is the Judge ok today? "@Thando Nkutha Sad if that is true! But "Gordhan was in charge of the treasury when some of the bad things like Arms Deal "Please somebody True!! I wish I had some electronic device where I can just push a button and blow up the idiot posting the spam whole network....Grrrrr Mr Pretorius No on duty today??...No tie
ofhie Muofhe,How can you be undermined by you junior and complain about it and not do anything about it That CEO is not being fair to black professionals. He cant just quit and blame everyone. hes a quad hearing problem africa time?
carnoth ngomane,"@Mzalwane Mzala thats very true "@Mzalwane Mzala true that but our judiciary has led us to where we are now @Mzalwane Mzala if you were following this commission you should know by now that our judiciary was also captured @Mzalwane Mzala but after how long?
kevindbn007,So how long will this commssion go on for unit some1 gtes arrested until someone gets arrested*
Cassidy Rupiya,Payments were being made in Cash - lol
Anne M.,@Thando Nkutha Is it a matter of his management style - being strict? Is this what the streets are saying? @Mzalwane Mzala Agree - we have a world class judiciary. There will always be a couple of bad apples in any large organisation. @Cerebis My conspiracy theory - JZ's friends have paid spammers and set up bots to try and distract us from hearing what's going on. @Yvonne Morudu They are paid spammers. Click on the name and 3 dots will come up. Click on Report or Block. @goolamv Done @goolamv 😂 @Magda Seguin No surprise there. Same modis operandi we've seen for years. @sipho cebo I share your concern. As long as they go for the big fish and not the little fish. I listened to it live "@lemmy mohale An innocent person would be at the commission demanding to be heard "@Magda Seguin I also think the whole Agrizzi hold up at the service station is iffy. A question that came to mind was "I think the quotes which should have been ""my understanding"" yesterday caused some concern. I think Judge Zondo's listened more today." @Takalani Luthada Moegsien Williams @Muriel Haynes He worked for SABC "@Pheladi Lamola No
Muriel Haynes,what a great witness let the truth be told right magda how did he know so much as this was submitted by 2013 to 2014 before all the noise was made about zuma this advacate is doing an rxcellent job roght magda right magda i would have given same notice as i would have been scared for my life well done to this witness wow he was so brave nobody was thwre to help me i dont know about the next witness Lol sham may be he want to still look young well he has a lot of hair for his age stop been jealous hajahaha shame jajjajaja i wonder how much he got paid? it his own hair he has extentions wow he is going on his own path does he have a drinking problem hahahahahahaha who did he work for i am lost ok really was confused judge nec judge became very quite he knows his job hey not me right magda hahahaha he was really excited

SBH Shembe,there has been a lot of corruption and I'm afraid we won't get all the criminals what is this gentlemen testifying about ?? break time.. hackers are going to start @Magda Seguin thanks someone is having some fun with the camera I see
Ben Cole,Ex minister Jeff Radebe and his interministerial task team will now have some explaining to do about the Waterkloof landing. This witness stood his ground in spite of the necessary interrogation by Justice Zondo. He didn't waver at all. Was prepared to be cross examined. The Justice has a duty to clarify uncertainties. "Judge him on the content of his testimony Here we go. Now its the haircut. What next? Just list all the prejudices. It's embarrassing! The conversations are now becoming more insulting and judgemental. Why? Because we started off by displaying severe prejudice about men wearing long hair. "Lew 464 Correct Magda Seguin.
