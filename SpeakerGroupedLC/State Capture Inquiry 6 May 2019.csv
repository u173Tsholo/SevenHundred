Deadbeat Cousin,"Is it pronounced as Prima Facie or Prima Facie Hahaha 😂😂😂😂
Granny Mokwena,"some of my reasons for not voting the ANC! The blatant looting if taxes is unforgivable
kleophas max,blf is for us.....the others are already on the train.....and mean/doing nothing for the landless...... DA...is a window dressing.....had no respect for the dead
makhosi nobhatyi,Does transnet will tell us who hire Gama? Wat procedures were followed? I assume there is no witness today @Val speirs I think only one way or another he can know just arrest him This is where it all started to loot state money and control executives "Poor Miss was bluntly used to enrich some individuals and herself Ramaphosa will win this election with convincingly victory 16 Million will vote for ANC Where is Singh? Does he still here in this country? He is all over at this state capture
Born free,Prepare for a dark winter folks. China has withdrawn its down payment of R7 billion China has withdrawn its down payment of R7 billion to Eskom to build two power stations. The kian total R33 billion. China is not convinced this money will be spent on the Power Stations. Dark times ahead.. load shedding day in and day out 😔 Guarantees and assurances have not been honoured in the past as per this Commission of Enquiry into State Capture Malema has promised everything for free but he doesn't say where the money is coming from. The DA is more honest can't promise everything for nothing . DA are realistic and a party that represents all South Africans. The only performance I have seen by the ANC.. is looting State Entities. ANC has abused its power of governance and is in breach of its statutory duties to this country. They are communist parties Zuma is so dumb he still doesn't know that he was captured by the Guptas and Watson. He was out there campaigning with State Gangster Ace. They have no guilt about their involvement in State capture Yes and I am suffering as a result of the ANC corruption The entire country is suffering because of the ANC Corruption. Forefathers are dead and gone trust you own judgement while you are on this earth. "They also come from Nigeria Actually I am not Afrikaans I am really Lucy Khoisan All those that are citizens of this country belong here whatever colour you are. The Titanic the lights will soon go off we will allow Julius Malema to sort the ANC out 😂😂in Parliament. He really has it in for Zuma and Cyril Jacob if you don't have the VBS money then Julius must have it. Jacob.. what's wrong with you? I see you and Ace are starting your own party the ATM does that mean Automatic Transfer Machine.. like transferring all state funds to your accounts or what? Yes nothing but the DA will be second and in 5 years the ANC and EFF will be history. Ja but Jacob there is an enquiry going on as we speak about you and your comrades and stealing from the public purse and you act like you are still the man Danie the didn't their qualifications were drawn out of a lucky packet. Zumas Black children will never struggle he has stolen enough money invested it off shore. All Of the State Entities have been captured. It is all very well getting land for free but it takes alot of Money to farm the land. What are you talking about Zwane? You think you can just go and farm it takes knowledge and hard work to farm something blacks do not do so well. Tracey Henry is not a south African EFF have not explained where they will get money from to give the majority who are poor.. free everything.. explain that! Tracy you are a troll living in the Bahama's Tracy as I said before your titanic notions consume a piece of cheese. Who comes to your aid in the Bahama's.. the Europeans that's who It is a white man who rents his home in Sandton to Malema and pays towards his campaigns. This man helps Malema financially but he is a Russian crook. Ramaphosa has made billions from economic apartheid.. since 1994. He is the second wealthiest man in South Africa Yes that will be true Tommy. Tracey Bahamian Henry what brings you to this debate you can't even vote so what is it? Tracey is a Troll with no voting rights DA will have a much higher percentage than the EFF Great Tracey has gone too far and this hate speech has implications. We will see on the day I mean I have 15 million votes. Not a right to hate speech you were referring to the hate speech If the EFF wins which I doubt.. the Russians are coming be aware. If the ANC win the Chinese are definitely settling here after all they will own Eskom . The Chinese will out number the blacks in this country. The Chinese are coming to take over the economy there's is slowing down. ANC =The Chinese.EFF=The Russians Like I said the Chinese will invade and they have military might. Africans won't stand a chance You just have to see how many Chinese there are in Botswana and they only employ their own people on contracts. The government will have to share the land it has already expropraited from white farmers since 1994. You were happier then in the mud huts and life was simple and there was respect for the elders. I am a citizen of this country I have my dompass to prove it. And I am voting DA on Wednesday I have 15 million votes. People were happy when they had mud huts and loin cloths. too.. Tommy it means Europeans were in Africa first but were neanderthals then and then migrated to other continents where they evolved.
