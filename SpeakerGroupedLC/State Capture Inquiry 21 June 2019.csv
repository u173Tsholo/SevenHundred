Reinette Raubenheimer,s0 much respect for you @deputychiefjusticezondo ooooeeeee excuses.... excuses... @Anne M... such a gentleman. @Ann M .... and sharper than a minora blade! huge responsibility on his shoulders.... my hart goes out to him... this is council for Mr v wyk if he is not guilty why worry about recordings? think from now on the stolen money will stream in the stolen money can create jobs.... tenders create jobs..... this is the purpose of the commission..... wipe out corruption beyond brilliant she stands her ground do you listen Mr v wyk????? oeeeee of course he received the e-mail exactly @Anne M! makes one think..... yup judge Zondo! judge Zondo is not going to back off this council is running out of words exactly judge Zondo! yessssss!!!! now you sound better council.... @Anne M.... think he does big time
Anne M.,He is fantastic. I am in awe of him. Yes "Yes @Reinette Raubenheimer 😃 He also needed to fly back from Cape Town "Van Wyk's lying - 6 different phone numbers as well as the ""dormant"" e-mail account. That's what ducking and diving looks like." "Buthelezi is being paid to ""defend"" his crooked client" BOOM! I wonder if Mr Buthelezi feels any embarrassment after that pathetic attempt? "@sanele songelwa Yes My (conspiracy) theory is someone doesn't want us to hear what's going on at the commission and spamming the chat will distract us. @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ ☝ "Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Community Safety and Transport @Nhlanhla Mncube He left the NPA after Jiba had him arrested and is now doing private prosecutions. "@Pastor JJ Pastor JJ Aw 😉 😆 @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ 😄 I'm teasing you. Idiot is back.

Zondo fish it out of her.. she is just here to send the commission around with nothing'
Born free,Please proceed with the witness this is a delay tactic bring the next witness and play the recordings. This is a tactical move to stop the recordings from being heard The private sector and Investor confidence creates jobs. I agree Government does not create jobs. Tenders through Nepotism not Merit. Tenders only create jobs for those involved in government Love this lady she is brilliant Abandoned email hahaha I think Van Wyk has many aliases he is very dark according to a previous witness If you forgot your password there are many ways to retrieve it especially with Gmail. Exactly can't allow witnesses to use the email as an excuse or no-one will appear before this commission. It's almost Lunchtime
Thulani Bukani,did anyone see the koisan brother last night? judge is a very fair guy I wonder what he gets from bothering us
funicanz,"Molweni I know. VIVA DCJ VIVA. "The email address is ACTIVE Is it Miss Buthelezi today? "Yhooo
Vuyo Saleni,😩😩😩
cassim suleman,commission prosecutors are amateurish..eish..
carnoth ngomane,These are just delay tactics best learned from Zuma @Thami Ngwenya she knows her story She does her homework properly vanwyk had about 4 different email address its his email address whether he uses it or not its his business
Kapn Krunch,government money doesn't create jobs businesses create jobs government money is tax money paid by people who have jobs no government dont create jobs they give tenders to companies that already exist jobs create government this is the problem half the country dont even understand how simple things work
makhosi nobhatyi,We are waiting for the money people come on don’t delay proceedings We want to create jobs indeed We did this procedure to all witnesses whom already come here why not mr van wyk? She must not come with lies here truth nothing but truth oath She was tipped off by Mahumapelo
Thami Ngwenya,Lomama is firm this guy ajoke Buthelezi hayi baba weak lawyer Maleka for Mr JZ LOST IT bUZA MAMA
Wildthing,this lady should be in the parliament. smart and has a great way to put points forward. Her and Maleka would make great MPs ha ha Judge is funny. ma ma ma ma ma The one he used as a crook 6 phone numbers and an email should be enough 👏👏👏👏👏👏 hope Van Wyk has long gum bootes on because the shyte just got deeper he owns the email address and can request a new password and go get the emails. dom kop dont think Miss needs lunch it's just Phishing. trying to make you click on the links to load viruses and other crap. just block them all. did she work for Mapara Supra yes that one my ID book has my address on as Bophotaswana. it's cool. no one can say the name correctly. used to not now. ha ha good point judge

HolyNation Grace,delay tactics
nhlanhla nkosi,she sounds scared
Lew464,Zondo has to process a lot of info. He is methodical and he is not going to be influenced by time waters. Huge respect for Zondo. Zondo for president.
Pheladi Lamola,Did she really have to read her qualifications? 😂😂😂 No argument there but she actually read that she has a B Com degree I blocked but he always comes back. They play around with the letters @Abel Matshidiso I hope he hasn't been implicated by some witness and he quietly recused himself. Or maybe he's waiting for Zuma to appear.
steve caballero,Agree with Lew464
