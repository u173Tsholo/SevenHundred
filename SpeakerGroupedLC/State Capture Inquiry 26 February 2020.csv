Gareth Hellyar,Morning all. Remember William Smith who did the maths and science program? There used to be a Math and Science program on SABC done by Prof. Smith years ago. He was fabulous! "And üëç @Stronger together Block Aubrey all. Got a chip on his shoulder. Think Aubrey a bot. Aubrey blocked! Lets stick to the program people. "Bye Israel. Apartheid State. Is this a political discussion? I identify as a human being. "Or This lady is boring. Im out of here. Bye. The word racism is too widely and too often used today. It has lost all meaning. @Derek Main . It also may be that people are too easily offended. Are you racist @Derek Main ? Yip @Tshepo Mokoto . Trying to paint herself white. "It does @Derek Main . On both sides. Or True. @Paul Buchel Please lets all just stick with what is going on here. Hlaudi. the clown. I find Hlaudi very entertaining. Would love for him to come back. Would be more entertaining this lady. LOL "Yes Hit nail on the head @Mzalwane Mzala .
Defnie Nanuses,morning
MJ,Come on Judge it is not so difficult!!! "Cedric Man Yan  "Come on
Cedric Man Yan,Nice working hours. ...no stress. I suppose they do start earlier. African culture
Bitcoin Assets Digital Currency,lol
nokutula ongowe2,Morning
Dan Brown,You guys should be using a Digital Mixer then you can call up a snapshot of yesterdays settings for every Mic and channel & then you won't have to fart around every time you take a break. C'mon Guys. This is Boring I am going to Dud Myenis trial feed instead.
Mzalwane Mzala,Multichoice state capture Koos Bekker must answer. Stop insulting of African culture. Koos Bekker and his crooks are protected. You can even hear and read the comments. Pretoria Chief Magistrate Desmond Nair provisionally suspended over Bosasa claims What does BEEE stand for? There is nothing called BEEE in South Africa Biko rejected the idea that others have got a right to speak for black people. He would have said it does not give @Lady Bird the right to tell black people how to respond to that situation. He is clear on that. @Lady Bird There is no way that you can be black the way Biko understood the meaning of blackness. Only whites and non-whites would defend the Bantustan system. Why was the EFF evicted in the Eastern Cape? No speculation please. Non-whites are uncomfortable when their 'masters' are challenged. @Mbombo Maleka and @Ayanda Diliza The likes of @Lady Bird has no interest in facts. I am glad that you finally realised Multichoice had captured the SABC and broadcast in South Africa People who do not follow South African news must not pretend as if some of these things were not raised previously. Google search her resignation in 2014. An article appeared in Mail and Guardian on 3 Feb 2014 "'Mokhobo is said to be stepping down because her situation has become untenable'. M&G "'Two centres of power have emerged at the public broadcaster Reports have suggested Mokhobo has had her authority undermined on a number of occasions. It is understood that she has simply had enough of the political fault lines tearing at the organisation. M&G @Mbombo Maleka She raised these issues and finally left because the board was on Hlaudi's side. It was in the media in 2014 already that she left because of that. Highest level of the country were involved So board members were carrying out political mandates? I know that they are appointed through parliament but they are not supposed to carry political mandates. The Public Protector is appointed by parliament but history tell us that we can not predict their behaviour Judges are appointed through a process that involves politicians but our judiciary has proven to be very independent. So it is not given that ‚Ä¶. @Lady Bird Parliament is not government
Keith Din,The DTT mess! Jeez! "The DTT mess inflicted a pain to me..... but anyway "The encryption was turned upside down She was quiet back then.... never ever heard even a single complaint from her back then mxm BORING "These execs are responsible for our unemployed graduates "Today they cannot tell us honestly "The current set pass rate is abysmal  Mmmmmxm Government and Ramaphosa too with a massive acres of land here in our Boland region @Stronger together Annoying this ma Gogo "she can't pose as a saint "she was part of the corrupt  Its a mess @Peet Venter SABC replaced all great programs with music lol and sad stories Who learns from such?

Why How can we or I help Mbuso @Mbuso Ndlovu ?? Hahaha... you mean haters ran out of data faster than those who're here to have a rational talk ? @Pastor J Its one of the SABC bosses that were quiet when they were seeing corruption happening @Mbuso Ndlovu "@Mbuso Ndlovu She is now trying to convince us that she was not corrupt.. she was on the right side. Yes she was Lol yeah ...jail... all of them. Those who lie also @Mbuso Ndlovu yeah @MIKE DURBAN ... we need some action and consequence management ! But she kept quiet lol @Tshepo Mokoto Can't understand these so called South African leaders .... Oligopoly Mzalwana ... "In this country

Aubrey Moloi,So Imtiaz Patel & Koos Bekker committed treason. profits over benefits for whole country especially poor and downtrodden eish ja neh "@phelaniLamola crooks.

Keith cant see now. waiting for Peet to respond thwn i block him Im so happy. I block all AfriForum bots that want to derail our conversations here. Guys the big picture is to fight WMC and their black enablers in govt or private sector pls because I block you too WMC bots @Thulani we can boycott but thing is we do not have another option. Multichoice will even pay corrupt politicians to change policy that benefits them @Rob the money came from Koos Bekker indirectly as he wanted this woman out bcos ahe was causing trouble for him. its a small amount compared to R1 billion rand they should have paid SABC Multichoice underpaid SABC so whats your point? who controls Multichoice? @rob i block afriforum bots boetie will see then "@mbombo Koos Bekker It will change very soon just wait & see @margaret your choice. if you are here for commision only then disable chats. obviously you are lying to yourself. im no racist. we all know cwm is a problem and today testimony talks to that

Block me as if I care I do not respond to racists Aubrey Moloi He has a bee in his bonnet re Afriforum and bekker @Mbombo Maleka thus BEE is failing? So why is the ANC still in control? "Well living in hope for 26 years "@Lady Bird so to the north Exactly Dominic @Lady Bird Ooooops @Lady Bird somebody mistook you as Afriforum:))) "@Lady Bird lucky you Glad for you
thulani fadashe,we will never hear of the white males at Multichoice who bankrolled themselves through these SABC deals. that board though they were playing the Chess game towards their benefit forgetting they were a long time checked by that peanut head.
Mbombo Maleka,"he he he its heated here mos @Moloi i have run out of patience-time to go back to the bush that the only language they understand AVC failed the people ANC no need to be heated up we are just debating as South Africans that is healthy for our democracy lol color dont matter here cant wait for Multichoice to come defend their capture allegations at Zondo commission lolz-@Stronger together what happened to freedom of speech well-said @mxolisi buthelezi even our women arecaptured sadly wait bot the budget vote today guysüòÅ but he created the Hawks in return they will be just give the teeth last year they filled almost 800 posts so this year the baby teeth should be canines It seems Zuma will remain trending for the next decade while our economy and land still resides in the hands of a few @Stronger together it would be nice if you substantiate that pls send to mmaleka@gmail thank you but my point remains that majority of the population is left out of the economic activites BEEE does not exist outside Luthuli House @Mzalwane Mzala stands for 'lets get rich overnight' at the expense of liberation @Stronger together in this case individuals refer to white Colored is black dude person of color as Americans would say colored is derogatory term i would not associate with myself or anyone i am so called colored too and my mind is beyond your expansion but lets leave it at that @Lady Bird wow my genetic professor @Lady Bird im sensing identity crisis-but like i said continue chatting on other matters dont mind my black self @Stronger together thats exactly what i was referring to sir üòÄ thank you sir @Ayanda Diliza not to mention that the 13% is all in land that is not usable "she was not really a leader there outside the command of hlaudi motsoeneng who was acting in the capacity of board @Pastor J she was also complicit-i dont see her as having the mantle to be a leader-Why did she not protest back then? She did not raise this at parliament-i serve the PCC and she appeared many times-instead she would remain mute in the presence of Hlaudi and chrony ministers she was questioned deeply during the inquiry also and even broke down a coul=ple of times infact she was privy to some of the questionable decisions so i dont buy her crocodile tear-am certain they are in waiting as we speak @Mzalwane Mzala board members in state entities are political appointments so they pay their dues and forget fiduciary duties unfortunately for the sake of the public process @Mzalwane Mzala you are correct but dont ever buy into that notion @Lady Bird not government but Parliament-RSA has 3 arms of the state
Margareth Waterboer,Bloody chat is swirling with unnecessary rubbish between @Aubrey and @Rob @Aubrey can only talk WMC.. blocking you racists all. I‚Äôm here for the commission...

Something that the ANC and black people are failing dismally in... "@Stronger together hahaha @Stronger together everything is controlled. Nothing happens in the vacuum. Ppl are angry at Zuma and the Guptas cos they don't understand how the world (order) works...
Dominic Przybylski,Only thing I can think of is to but the country into business rescue under IMF and for democracy to be suspended until the economy is stabilised. We will need United Nations to bring in peace-keeping force to maintain law and order because our police and army are likely to go on strike. "We need what Solidarity did in Poland to get rid of communist regime - ""Active Strikes"" where workers got factories working again by ignoring their corrupt and incompentent management." ANC/SACP/COSATU have modelled themselves on the political elite in Soviet Union who used communism to enrich themselves at the expense of their gullible citizens. Race has been manipulate by the apartheid government and the current government to prevent people debating the real problems of our country. "@Lady Bird Try to identify yourself by your own individual consciousness. Try to imagine yourself as an autonomous and unique individual. That is what ""empowerment"" is all about." EFF wears a uniform because they are anti-individual. "EFF/ANC always talk about ""the masses"" they don't want anyone to think for themselves." Race is used to obscure the real problems of our country. As long as it is the basis of political power we won't be able to solve our country's problems. "We desperately need to escape our obsession with race. The associated emotions prevent us from looking at things constructively

Derek Main,@Gareth Hellyar I agree. EFF wears a uniform because they are quasi-fascist. Similar to the Brown Shirts. @Gareth Hellyar That might be because racism is widespread. @Gareth Hellyar Are you denying that racism is rife? "@Gareth Hellyar I don't think so. If I have any racism in me @Gareth Hellyar To deny that racism exists is to live in denial. @Paul Buchel I agree it has a lot to do with respect and treating people with some dignity. @Gareth Hellyar Careful what you wish for - you might get it. @Gareth Hellyar I thought you meant back to SABC but I guess you meant to commission.
