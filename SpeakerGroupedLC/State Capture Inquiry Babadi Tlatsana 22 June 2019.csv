Kevin Simon,"Get her written proposal Finally. I said so yesterday. Don't bite the hand that feeds you. ANC mentioned again! ANC again so because she was sitting on R21m of laundered funds van who decided to fill her is and get her aboard with a longer term scheme. Zuma thought a billion rand was a bottomless pit. Clever man with standard 3. ü§£ If CR is displaced expect R100.00 # $1.00
T the X,was she naive or she is pretending not to have known anything
tumelo mosadi,where are the trucks ma'am
Lew464,"Clueless "typical of young startup companies who so she was scared the ANC would kill her? Is that the way the ANC operates? she should be subjected to a lifestyle and financial audit. she knew what she was in for. When she was not receiving what she was promised...decided to become a whistle-blower. "when someone consults a ""spiritual"" adviser (sangoma) and not a lawyer "hey MD
Michelle Kingsley,oh it was highjacked... but its her business correct... who then forced her to open the company pty? how the fudge Fnb does phone when unusual payments are made thats a lil true Fnb bank phoned me when my oldest son did purchases on my card with fortnite but it was muliple purchases ken that was funny big question now adays? how do you get a tender asap. be a women in business and of colour too but how can she be so naive not to know whats happening in her own business how the fudge can you meet at spur for a meeting its a family restuarant its sad though people need others to instigate corruption on such a level... south adrica is the laughing stock of the world corrupion makes me so antisocial.... to scared to make friends even :( wash that money :(
Wildthing,yesterday she said she did nit understand the questions in English. but some of the words she uses are high English. now she is turning her statements. go Blue Bulls kick off now not too smart. she was the owner and could have blocked the account. sorry say that again. She was the owner and had rights to block any movements in and out for the bank account. and she could have reported this when it seemed it was not what she was planning on doing. ha ha the inflow of money and no goods to show what the outgoing money was been used for. is she a member of ANCWL any connections there

Ashne Hesselberg,I feel so sad for her. I see her as a naive uneducated woman who tried her best to start a business. These vultures saw her coming and preyed on her naivety üò≠
Born free,She was part of of the conspiracy to defraud SAX and enjoy the dividends for doing nothing. She approached them Yes this is how third party contracts work in SA. She was aware according to her evidence of wrong doing in July 2015 a month after the money went into her account?? and she does nothing??? Is she testifying voluntarily or was she supeoned?? The Bank phoned her to question the transaction she did not answer the calls FNB reversed the transaction they were becoming suspicious I don't believe she ever asked for Invoices from the onset she is involved in money laundering and fraud. The plot thickens Van Wyk is a black man All she had to do was obtain the Invoices from the contracting companies The commission will call these people to the enquiry and any paper evidence must be submitted. Yes and whether she has paid tax on these dividends. The majority are the looters. The Chair has such a deep voice he has to speak slowly Wish don't think this recording is going to be of any value Eish not audible Brian scored for his gay friend lifetime partner The question is.. is she a whistle blower.. did she volunteer to come to the commission or was she supeoned?? haha more like a vuvuzela Then she is most definitely a part of of this fraud All aboard the gravy train that's what it has been. She is acting out to save herself Is that Van Wyks attorney in the background behind Miss Hoffmeyer?? she has to make notes She is ANC She did not volunteer she was requested to give evidence. She has no problem with big English words. BEE against a minority group has killed this country . BEE is not even structured on a merit or qualification basis. They must lose their pensions as well as there positions. It's a recording of Van Wyks conversation with her at the Spur. Van Wyk does not know he is being recorded Yes Lyn Brown has been implicated to the Guptas Lynn Brown... Eskom.. the Guptas Zuma in mid July to face the Commission This BEE is a load of nonsense The Midlands makes excellent furniture Was the furniture from Sutherland's?? BEE is a discrimination against a minority group and designed to steal their jobs Danie... you should blow the whistle and appear before this commission. Was the Midlands firm.. Sutherland's @Norman Zwane.. This Midlands firm was the bosses name Craig?? Is the owner of the Midlands firm Craig Steele @Norman Zwane.. please tell us we are curious ?? @ Norman Zwane.. you must know the company and does it exist today?? I wonder if Cyril is listening today ü§îü§î Yes Van Wyk could have taken it all Absolutely.. Danie Yes Esidemeni It would seem the witness was paid R500 000 and then the business account was liquidated once all the funds had been looted. Yes Norman I think you are right So now she is in control! She gained control for more gains. She enjoyed money for nothing See she can think and use big words when she wants to Are these airports functional??? There could have been Ghost employees We know there are Ghost fire engines Yes Ben she is complicit in money laundering. As sweet as she is.. She is in trouble. "The witness is implicated in money laundering They will all play victims but it won't save them from their corrupt deeds. Gavin Watson will have to be extradited from Britian and I don't think that SA and Britian have such a treaty Watson has dual citizenship the NPA know where he is I forgot Racketeering Jiba Yes from the looted money.. I wonder when the bail money was returned to her if it went into her personal account?? I don't agree with dual citizenship it opens a door for criminals. Commission had a timeline and must catch up Freedom of speech you have no right to tell people what topics they can chat about.

Khaya Nomoyi,Why not consult a lawyer or accountant instead of a spiritual father.She was so complaisant although she saw the signs of fronting early in the business. I am so interested to know whar is Mr Van Wyk and his sidekicks are going to say.
Antonie Engelbrecht,yes skelms....... she neer had a buss......just ontacts pay back the money anc
Surinderjit Singh Rana,GOI india PROXY gupta family via bank of Baroda GOI owned money laundering #statecapture SA
Naledzani Mashau,Cassim you are 100 percent right It was the bank of Dubai She's a bird of the same further Mr van Wyk is an African guy I was just trying to help no malice or offence guys The ANC big fishes are in the stream of the rot Thando are you serious? I'm with Cyril we are watching it live lol
Vish Govender,Serious case of money laundering. I hope SAPS and NPA are alive to this testimony This person pretends to be naive. The Judge is conscious of this. Its her company. 15 Million and some odd and she did not take even `million. So who really owned this company. ANC????? Absolutely on point PASTOR It appears van Wyk was the enabler for the ANC It appears that she did do something to gather evidence to show wrong doing. Maybe we should not judge her until all the evidence is presented including the recordings of conversations. Yes PASTOR. That's the burning question. This testimony is critical. ANC further exposure She gets R500 000 and ministers get 20 million. No wonder she is singing. Govt . A cash cow for ANC and ministers. A prison for those who steal. ANC will be the majority party there
donovan daniels,these crooks brains are so Small if it was dynamite it wouldn't even be enough to blow their brains what about the COMMISSION this commission is doing an outstanding job you can see that she's committed to this i think the chairman is bit SLOW but yet his a very considering chair when is GAVIN WATSON coming to testify
Barbara Lutendo Birungi,just joined: who is on the stand and which organisation?
Ken Fer,banks if south Africa are helping these crooks FNB the Gupta's stole billions because our bank systems are weak but brian deserve life in prison they used this woman dream and they uaed her i feel for this woman. this woman ia old school and Brian outsmarted her this happens in government tender . if you want business they ask money crime has no colour but mgwenya was the best witness abd van wkj is in trouble why can the commission goes to that company that received money if they did the work but brian scored 9 million gor his galfriend man i guess this country is rich .the government can provide for service delivery to its citizens corruption is killing this country they must set a special corruption courts for speed of this case the problem is appointment of cadre's on government position while graduate arr at home but Brian will be in trouble with zondo questions when he comes

Sindiswa Moolman,She was part of the whole State Capture Corruption Project. She is a NW Agrizzi. She wants us to believe that she had some level of integrity. This woman looks and sounds dodgy in her answers and body language "This woman is under investigation for her corruption etc. Look at the monies that moved to different people. This woman must be recharged. The Chinese people are here now? Yhooo... Supra. i hope she will be able to prove these incidents and the messages. Hahahaha @Born free Uyaxoka lomfazi. Where are the recordings? I agree @Norman Zwane This woman is liar. I will not be surprised if the Commission comes back empty handed on these police cases. I voted the ANC because JZ was no longer the president and CR demonstrates that he is cleaning up all this mess @Fello Mkhize . Supra will not get away with this @Thembisa Odendaal Thats your opinion @Andre Gerber and you have a right to it. "I will remind you of this chat with you @Thembisa Odendaal I have my colleagues in that Commission listening and investigating every evidence that comes out it @Thembisa Odendaal.

Bernard Matolino,"Deputy Chief Justice Zondo @Born free That is what some of us have been saying since she took the stand @Magda Seguin Yesterday you were a corruption and fronting expert today you are an oncologist -- who works every Saturday "@Magda Seguin Ever heard of a figure of speech @Magda Seguin You started with me. I was just being a cyberspace citizen and you interfered with my rights. @Born free And this witness knew exactly what was happening but now she wants to play victim Well nothing has happened to all who have been implicated on this forum. Remember Agrizzi's gripping testimony? Not even a local sergeant has called anyone in for basic questioning @Thembisa Odendaal Thanks that was really my point. Justice Zondo is an admirable man. His work ethic is great. Even the breaks on this commission are to the minute @Ben Cole I think everyone must be allowed to make their point without some bullying from dark corners @Mhleli Sibanyoni I also didn't know Gavin made a run for it. He copied the lowly Guptas Hayibo she was arrested she doesn't even care what she was arrested for. even if i was arrested for public indecency I would remember that. Racketeering and she forgets? @Mhleli Sibanyoni Well put my brother. Well put. She knows being arrested is just initiation into a club of the elites of the elites of eating public funds "In normal countries "FOLKS
Mzalwane Mzala,Which hospitals are closed on a Saturday?
Mhleli Sibanyoni,At the time she was complicit because she participated and agreed Please. This don't use this as a @Lex vs @Magda platform When is Van Wyk coming to testify? "Thembisa Is Gavin Watson in UK. Was he allowed to leave SA? Hayi bo. I though dual is not allowed in SA. Hence Gigabytes was NOT supposed to have granted Guptas citizenship? Banana Republic. You get arrested but cannot remember what it is for Pays personal bail money from company bank account Thanks @Magda Seguin on dual citizenship clarification "Thembisa and Born Free Apologies Born free. Your free speech uses my expensive data on issues that have nothing to do with State Capture Inquiry = Free speech at my cost = Data is expensive @MYANC was always used as an excuse to siphone money out of SOEs Remember they even stole monies intended for Nelson Mandela funeral ALL post 1994 @MYANC TGs from Msimanga to Mashatile must come give account This Babadi Tlatsana is a clown Zulu watch (traditional skin) = Isphandla SUPRA She scammed the scammers @Fello Mkhize which party should they vote in 2021 Now she remembers that there is a custom. She even obeyed thieves Is this witness normal? "@Tholithemba Ntsele I don't care for ANC Just imagine if all this money was put into Education "@Tholithemba Ntsele
