Desmond Masilela,Morning everyone This is another way of wasting time. instate of starting 9:30 am we tend to start 10:00 just to try and fix filing. This is annoying. @Frik Brits. No that would delay the commission. I think given them warning would be better. I think the water is getting into the guy knees @Frik Brits. work overtime they will need more cash for that. Warning would be better. @Frik Brits 😂😂😂 Zwane who? @Slindile Ngcobo. 😂😂😂 Come on Slindile. Who is that Zwane @Slindile Ngcobo. thank you Slindile. Was he also been capture or what? It seems like this are the honest guys we need. Even though they could not do anything then but at least they knew something was not right. Minister Zwane This guy sound secretive @Frik Brits. Now I understand why you said the chair should send all back to the office. This is not right. These ppl they getting pay for this. @Frik Brits. I think they are lazy to do the job.

He accept the wrong doing but that will let him in trouble trust me. @Thando Nkutha. The man knew what was going on. believe me. "@Thando Nkutha. Then he should say so This guy he acted as if his hand are clean but i can see his hand are dirty Something are not correct but you could not figure that out by then. You should have question this before. Ppl just go study for the sake of ripping us. This guy is not telling the truth. Now is like he was brainwashed? "Then its simple Because of his negligence. @Thando Nkutha. NO Thando....😂😂😂 The man is negligence he would have sign and realize after. @Thando Nkutha you correct on that one.

Tile Thandile,morning everyone
Frik Brits,"This thing with the unclear and illogical filing systems is most annoying "@Desmond Masilela  mmmmm cronoloical orders wrong as well !! "@Desmond Masilela  "No No No Wow this guy is real smart? I really like smart people !! "@Dimakatso Tshinaba  "@Cassius Mngomezulu  "Again "@Desmond Masilela  "@Norman Zwane  @Nkululeko Zondo and now we all know what u said?? "@Nkululeko Zondo  "@Norman Zwane  Soundshedding again ?? I hope she's got her files right this time ?? "@Julius Me  "Ohhh Gawd the whole stream's gone!! "Ag no man 😨😨😨😨😨😨
Sebation Nantsika,Ons terug Molweni Africans "Look the Ramontja’s tie  He was busy reading bona magazine and forget to verify any document he is signing
Sebe Ndyalvane,That Is true he is so smart
Slindile Ngcobo,Gupta Zwane Mosebenzi Zwane...Zuma appointee to Minister of Mineral Resources @Nkululeko Zondo ....agree 100%
Vusumzi Ngcoza,DR RAMONTJA
Dimakatso Tshinaba,Judge Zondo being deep now eish I'm also in Parktown and electricity is in full force
Robert Russell,Did Zwane not sigh off on the Estina Dairy farm when he was the MEC in Free State ? *Sign "Discover Medical aid reported that highest fraud claims are from Limpopo It's not his fault he looks like the younger brother of ACE the thief... See the SABC has gone broke
carnoth ngomane,"TO get to the marrow of the bone @ Cassius those are bad news He is beginning to conceal information now "his tribe shouldnt matter at this point "@ Nkululeko pathetic indeed "up to now he hasnt added any value to the commission "@ Nkululeko "@ Nkululeko "thought hes said Zwane centralised everything i wonder what criterion was used to hire this guy as a DG "you dont know who brought the letterto yuor attention
Singi Mathebula,and Zwane is in the ANC list!! come on guys. the electoral system must change. people are used as pawns in the name of voting the ANC so painfully 😱 zwane GUPTA @lucky123🤣🤣 @cassius Mngomezulu u phuze i ntelezi i will ensure that attend their funerals just to satisfy myself that indeed they have rested. a memo must have names of people going with the minister. come on Dr tea break? what us the difference between ANC and EFF when it comes to corruption. who lead the demise of Limpopo and VBS? in fact eff will be worse. Dr's voice is now toned down!! is he an honorary Dr? @Ann M. not convincing! was this guy appointed because he had what it takes for the job or it was jobs for friends ? "ignorance cannot ve an excuse. he must take responsibilty what does this Dr know honestly? dr was almost emotional when he started 😳was he seeking sympathy? ku nzima emzanzi😱😎
mandla motsoeneng,which minister are they talkin about?
sivenathi sivenathi,msebenzi Zwene
Lucky123 Thwala,mosebenzi Zane with voice of thief "same as former commissioner Phahlane "@Cassia mgomezulu
Mooki Thabane,"What kind of president sacrifices the future on the altar of incompetent
Zolani Mnqika,😎
Neil Fraser,@Cassius Zumba did not have the qualifications to fully appreciate his role "With all his qualifications and experience His argument is pointless because if he was concerned about it all he would first find out who drafted the letter before signing it. Haha The letter just appeared in his out tray... he signs it ... and just disappeared from his office. @Sfiso Nkosi Or lets agree it was a error of judgement. There’s obviously some deeper sinister activities within the department. "I’ve solved it ...Maybe the cleaners wrote the letter He should have acknowledged his error of judgement first up. Better late than none. Really @Magda.? That’s a huge assumption Well done Chairperson. It was not just any letter. Trying to hide his inefficiency by trying to be a martyr I think he said at the start that he runs a private advisory service. Mmmmmm Yes @Pitso....why? @Magda The rescan for being fired was not disclosed. It was certainly not for signing the letter. Dress code of all lawyers ...ouch Does Zumba ever appear before the commissioner? Oops Zuma Thanks @Noel. It’s obviously going to be a long drawn out process. More file dramas coming. SABC received the letter
Sifiso Msibi,We South Africans cannot be fooled forever.
Nkululeko Zondo,Mr. Maleka accent is the one from Woolies water Why is it people dont recall the answers for the difficult questions? This is strange @Norman Zwane Mangethe uyamuzwa nawe uMaleka uyaroller ngathi ubuya eNgilandi😂😂 If yesterday ANC List is correct and final one its an embarrassment to the Nation and shows ANC dont take people seriously and must be punished on the 8th of May @Frik Brits yes he does and oozing with confidence I have to visit my brother DCJ Zondo tomorrow late and ask him when is this commission will be completed we cant be glued on this commission for all the time with no ending. Also we want Big fishes We need Agrizzis on this commission not people who were just runners with no power @Cassius Mngomezulu else its speak to our President being controlled and being a week Leader. Is this the new dawn we were promised? @Cassius Mngomezulu how do you guarantee such? If the power is with the branches then once he start reshuffling they will recall him and out number him. They will fire him just like Mbeki and Zuma "So this guys Dr Ramontja was not responsible for anything? Just taking orders and sign everything ? Post Office is this guy Then how do we hire such poeple like Dr Ramontja in such positions? So pathetic. Where is he working now or what does he do? "@Eslon Eslon i can only hope so It really saddens me that all the guys we looked up to being Black excellence were mostly used by less educated guys in corruption and got implicated. I believe all are greedy and benefited. "@carnoth ngomane true than "@Eslon Eslon yes for you to be a Pres and successful in business you gotta be smart
Masande Binza,this is just wast of our taxi~money bcz all these commision nobody get arested.
Henk Smith,patience. the wheels turn slowly
Musa Bakiti,If you don't have the land you will develop poverty .Poverty makes a man to look for short mean of get money.
Norman Zwane,@Nkululeko Zondo Sokhulu! Yinhloboni leyo accent? Waze wangibulala ngensini ngisathwithwa ikhofi. "@Duze Mthimunye ""a little..""? You are a kinder soul than I am." @Frik Brits I just wanna weep when I remember how many losses I suffered before a very impatient commissioner who did not tolerate poorly paginated bundles. "@Desmond Masilela It's not just a job @Nkululeko Zondo Kodwa Sokhulu! Uya roller? Angithi thina omkhulu babethi sikhishwa ngamakhala? Generational gap? Asisathinyulwa sesiyaginqwa? "@Frik Brits Yes the numbering is simple There is a hairstyle that is grabbing my attention. Guess which? "Maleka is having a tough time leading this guy. This Dr Ramontja has got Woolies ""free-range"" chicken tendencies. Ufuna ukuyekwa anhlanhlathe nje!!! Hayi uyabhora." He might just get the 3rg degree treated like a hostile witness. @Stephan Dolk what was all that expensive education for if all you become ia red post box? Bulisa Nkosini ungena sihleli sisebandla @Thando Nkutha "@Thando Nkutha Dr Ramontja is no book E Nkosini! "@Thando Nkutha UMangethe wasiphoxa. sathi sisabonga koNtshosho ukuthi nathi sivelele @Funani Manzi He has a wife? Hayi amakhisikazi ayakwazi ukubekezela bakithi! "@Thando Nkutha Ugogo uNaMabuza wayethi uma efuna ukubamba ugcekeni @peter pott Tjo! Those are expensive pecks. I guess in theses economic times its worth suffering otherwise in order to access these perks.
Duze Mthimunye,I'm a little perturbed by Mr Maleka's wrong pronunciation of Mr Godongwana's surname when he calls him Gondongwana!
Stephan Dolk,frigging liar "I don't no.... eish zondo is stuffing this up for the lawyer effing liar. he was owned a just did what he is told. they should ask him what he wanted to revisit? that should be revealing
michael mbatha,This guy comes across as someone who wants to give as little information as possible. "@thabani matthews - In fact this guy is lying. I mean This guy doesn't come across as a high ranking individual at DG level. No wonder he was even left behind and his subordinate was taken overseas. Even Maleka asked why such an important project like Optimum will not involve him. Are they on lunch time?
Eslon Eslon,"@Cassius Mngomezulu Cassius.. The president is not obliged to keep people who are heavily tainted in corruption for a longer period Guys don't worry all corrupt individuals will become back benchers "@Nkululeko "Nkululeko Can a doctor also steal is it possible? "@Thando Nkutha Koko the tweeting engineer! Maleka is crushing this doctor now Koko is a disaster really Can't they stop this inquiry and locked up Jacob Zuma and his cronies and throw away the prison`s key somewhere in the Asian Ocean. This is really too much why is Nene back again? @Desmond. Thanks "@Magda Seguin But sabc is live in parliament why is it off here?

peter pott,"lol! you got to love how the mafia operates I'm government. ""don't ask questions "@zondo "@zwane "I said hai "I said chili..""😀😀😀😀it's tough today DG."
Sfiso Nkosi,"I'm finding it hard to understand this guy 😂😂hai this Dr was scammed "Aowa this Dr wasn't running that department @Neil Fraser who does that in his rightful mind. This Dr must open up and tell the truth. @Tsepang Ranneileng that can only happened if they have something against you. "He who feeds you @Desmond Masilela 😂😂😂it doesn't make sense Is there anything that this Dr was sure of or something that he was fully aware of in that department? He got his share and now his trying so hard to act clean. if we dig deeper there are skeleton around Dr. that's just my 2cent Is there any summoned to Koko? "@Thando Nkutha can't wait for that day "😂😂😂Give this Dr a bell SABC don't do this to us
Magda Seguin,Koko acted as the Don of the mafiaoso All the minions had to step in line and obey instructions from Zuma and the Guptas It seems that they wanted to create 'fall guy's...in essence 'patsys' Typical mafia modus operandi True The day Koko testify should be explosive he has a LOT to account for People were manipulated according to their character flaws @Tobo exactly so many people were used and abused...it was capture strategy The psycho dynamics of state capture is thesis material @Tsepang...it happened to me once and I flatly refused to sign and made myself very unpopular as the 'troublemaker' and 'too clever for I saw many people being used...tragic "Only those who have never been in a highly charged high level working environment criticise @Neil...really...Read the book called Snakes in Suits a d you will be enlightened Valuable lesson for the youth...your signature is sacrosanct "Correct So in essence he was fired 'asked to resign is a tactic to circumvent CCMA Nene was not asked to come back he chose to come back There are moles in the ANC feeding the EFF with info according to news reports
present mathebula,young people where are you
Chris Welensky,"For a ""Dr' this dude is talking in circles patting himself on the back!"
Tulonga Henoch,The gentlemen is cornered already....😂😂😂😂😂 When cornered lies and lies all starts.....give his Dr some water Impossible...he remembers very everything but that wants to prove his non-involvement in this. If you were not part of the game you will spill the beans. "Adv Maleka will probe him on this letter as he wants him to deny it Hindsight....
Tobo Lwandile,"leave the dg alone he was just caught in gupta corruption network focus on zwane and koko "just came from sabc livestream
Thakane Mthimkulu,"Truth always have weight
Tsepang R,"All you criticising the Dr have clearly never been in compromising situations. It doesn't matter how meticulous you are in your demeanour and it takes the slightest blip for you to get compromised and inevitably become the scapegoat. We are all human after all. This guy has an impeccable service record! give him a break! @Magda I'm fully with you on this one "The moral decay in the ANC government is sickening! no regard for ethics whatsoever! I've been in government before
Johnny Cash,Wake up South Africa not one single guilty person will ever go to jail while ANC is in control. This is a farce. ✊🏿eff We will nationalise and expropriate VBS bank so it doesn’t matter about jail or the 2IC Not one single guilty corrupt cadre will ever go to jail while anc in power ✊🏿eff I will never rest in my lifetime until the anc and it’s corrupt people is hanged ✊🏿eff is coming in May 19
