Bonani Maphini,I have a feeling that Mentor is gonna drop some serious bombs today hoekom? Lest hope its not constructed lies... Sexual harassment allegations against Zuma will certainly be raised by Aunty Mentor She is mixed Wonga. Half Xhosa and Half Coloured lol we will get shocked today Remember Mentor is the same person who claimed we already signed nuclear contracts with Russia... You know what this commission is like a movie but we will see as its goes She must just testify and not mention the name of the old man Old man must just enjoy Bells in Saxonwold... "Mentor is nervous You cant be nervous if you know u gona speak the truth imbokodo vs imbokodo Ingathi uzokhala ngk uMentor "I am also having back to back meetings today LOL tHEY SHOULD HAVE ASKED HER TO TESTIFY ON fACEBOOK Let me go and grab a cup of coffee to stay awake kuzoba lit she is gonna complicate herself Judge Zondos Voice yoh She will only fee free when she talks about the Guptas China via Dubai LOL Dubai ziyakhipha Sanwold and Dubai...I dont wanna hear those names saxonwold "Via Dubai Who is Duduzani NO HOLY COW INACCURACY in the book Give us the name "Give us name...I am teacher by profession "Hlongwa She wrote the book long time ago but only today she note that there is inaccuracy in the book My memory pulls Hlongwa sometimes i mix up with Hlongwana Let me go to the meeting... plz finish the question of identity HLONGWA AND HLONGWANE Kodwa and Kodwa(BUT) same thing back from the meeting...any updates guys i am sure i missed a lot Thanks Thobile "I left here: #VytjieMentor :""In my book I mistankely said Duduzane Zuma introduced me to Brian Hlongwa. But it was actually Fana Hlongwane. Because I always confuse the two""" The danger about telling lies is that you must always remember what you said Her book contains misleading information and we must believe everythin she says here

Trucker Trucker,This one is just here to embarras herself. Mentor clearly more brave behind the keyboard because now she looks nervous. Looks like Vytjie Mentor is now the one who is on trial for corruption. LOL this person is a lair. "Hlongwa and Hlongwane confusion. I've heard this before? ""I don't know which Gupta brother offered R600mil""" uSisi was only given credibility because she was attacking people the media hated ......honestly though she has proven herself as dishonest "Sunshine B So called star witnesses are doing a spectacular job derailing this commission. No further assistance will be necessary. 😂😂😂😂 This woman couldn't wait to expose the Guptas yet all she's been doing all morning is mumble. Is she even in charge of her facebook page?? Thuli Madonsela has some explaining to do because all her whistleblowers/key witnesses have horribly fumbled. "Thabo Kganyago "Dude This is actually sad when I think about it. They should have just left her to post on Facebook in peace. SMH. "Ntloya Nloya I don't understand whatever language that is chief. The fact remains. These are just statements of two people. Both of them have not even presented any claims and both have no witnesses. Jonas was sharp? The same Jonas that couldn't tell which Gupta brother allegedly bribed him? Laughable. Just because he was eloquent does not mean he was sharp. "Ntloya Which year? LOL do you guys remember when this mama posted on Facebook that Gigaba signed the nuclear deal and it would enslave us to the Russians? Is this your key witness? REALLY? "Bronx

They've hurt the entire nation (black and otherwise) for personal gain. "Lets not insult each others intelligence Perhaps i am naive(as some of you might be thinking) but the truth is we all know these people did what they're accused of just based on their reactions to þe accusationz This is the proble This is the problem with SA.

I was expecting more from this lady but...oops! Can you find someone guilty of something through Ms Mentor's testimony I wish some of us especially black people should stop paying attention to the guy called Fils de l'homme because he is here to undermine and humiliate us.

Jacob Ditsheho,Reading some of the messages indicates that South Africans lack patriotism. Many of us are not taking this commission seriously. Credo was correct when he said we are easily infiltrated by other nations because we lack vision and identity. Fils is another virus that wants to degrade us as a poeple. He is a servant of the devil who devalues human life. Let's ignore Fils he does not deserve our attention. Fils you can't even use a shovel - there's a lot ou do not know about how Europeans have distorted history so that they can appear to be the inventors. Kemet changed to Egypt for example. Fils your knowledge is based on the history that was told by your father who is the oppressor of Afrikans. So he will only tell you how he improved our lives and not how he raped my grandmother. "Fils your grandfather will also tell you how barbaric we are but he will not admit to himself committing the acts of the devil Fils the truth will hurt you. You see the Jews were slaughtered for four years by Hitler but Afrikans were slaughters for 500 years and even today it continues. Fils your grandfather taught you to think like that about us. But my grandfather taught me to know the devil when I see it.
Thobile Nxumalo,"The comments section here is more LIT than the testimony! Vy needs to relax a bit Fils is an idiot!

Maimane H. L. Lekwane,"I think
Orefile Macheoane,"""i do not remember""" I am thinking the texpayer does not reap the rewards of their hard earned money. Tax money spent on Banquets. State Banquets The Guptas fetch you from your hotel room. "Dubai is not just for ""slayqueens"" i see." She is explaining her issues with being in a banquet of hostility. She refused to attend. And enjoyed the facilities of Dubai with the taxpayers dibas Zuma had a reputation. with women What would Zuma have done to Vytjie though. "if she flew all the way to Dubai She is busy telling us a story of how the guptas tried to capture her. And she flew back early because of a fear of being trapped in the covers with our former president Southpaw i see this is a big syndicate Her itenerary doesnt match with her story. China and India are going to do wonders.. They even organisedan impromptu dinner for her. Transnet paid for all her expenses? i do not think this is a small matter. This can of worms you abuse money. Report yourself to the powers that be. And then you are found not guilty Vytjie was living the life. What position does she hold? But the lady leading the questioning is confusing too. We are not dealing with points properly We need relevant facts. But the questions need to be relevant too. I think it would be better to know what donald Trump thinks of South While we are having commissions. People are looting SOE's How much did we(south africa) lend from China to save us? "@Aubrey Franks i will do so. I knew times were changing when i saw ""China Bank of Costruction"" in the middle of Sandton." "But we see that everywhere we go I wish the chairperson would leas the questioning throughout. its almost lunch and we havent heard anything new. She burnt her 2010 diary. But someone made a copy. I think she has something to hide. All these stories are a smoke. "did the Guptas own a travel agency """i recall..."" ""leaning on memory...""" Lol peter.

Mkhuseli Freddie,"there are many zupta propagandists here trying to discredit this process because their ""Baba"" is the subject of investigations." these zupta tyrants never get tired. i just imagine what we would have been had the #ANC not recalled the corrupt Zuma. one thing the Zupta psychophants dont realise is that the fact that the witness cant remember something(s) doesnt necessarily mean what the witness is saying is untrue.
