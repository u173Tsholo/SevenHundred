Theophilus Molatelo,ANC is Lord of criminals peoples in south Africa
carnoth ngomane,@Theophilus Molatelo do you care to give more light on your sentiments @psyfrequency Techno which political party can one vote for except AN "@Derek Main i hear you but one cannot go to a voting station with a view of voting for any party bar ANC "@Derek Main MANIFESTOS can misleading @Derek Main so to you everyone who doesnt see things your way is a fool? "@Derek Main seeing that you are smart may you please use your brain and advice me as to which party to vote for cos im stuck with ANC and that makes me a fool according to you "@Derek Main i guess it is a question of sending a child of five to fetch a child of five. your hatred for ANC makes look and sound like a fool @Derek Main Zuma's tenure was disastrous indeed but now that Cyril is at the helm im gonna give ANC my vote irrespective of your view "@Nosiphiwo Zantsi worry not i know his type @Derek Main then who can better run this country according to you? "@Derek Main you cant keep telling us not to vote for ANC yet you cant provide an alternative @Derek Main you cant fool me sir? You are a DA and wmc staunch your hatred to people who like ANC says it all @Derek Main unfortunately for you sir ANC will win the election com 8th may with or without your hatred "@Derek Main yest they messed up but if there people who wanna vote for so be it  "@Derek Main unfortunately for you "@Derek Main clearly you cant get rid of Anc @Derek Main and you are one of them @Derek Main you have never voted for ANC and you never will "@makhosi nobhatyi stop explaining yourelf @welton paulse i concur with you
poloko collen,ppl have leaders in Africa most of us have theifs and con man and con woman both in government and business.All races. ANC (Another Night with Candles)
makhosi nobhatyi,"Does it affect this commission black out? Mbalula is coming Friday be ready "Structural plant equipment is old so calmed down ANC will respond to the crisis "The board executives comes there finds lot of irregularities and unlawful decisions was made by ex executives which lead us to this mass "More people will be arrested and prosecuted "Inquiry helps the country to know what went wrong "Zuma lied to South Africa and the ANC "You must understand that Zuma did what he did on his behalf not for ANC "@Derek main that was a strategy to come things down if you see how loud those who were close to Zuma "@Derek main yes he was not alone "Carnoth ngomane not that ANC couldn’t see what Zuma did problem is he like to play victim "Derek main as head of the nation should fight corruption not you as president get involved how do you expect that happen? Security agencies "African refugee look things you may do during your time as someone in control but results will come after you "Derek main Zuma is number one "Report comes out about security agencies how they operate to protect Zuma by spreading lies "Derek main thanks we are together that is why we have this commission to see what went wrong and those who did wrong face consequences that is all we are doing "Those who says Ramaphosa is corrupt please come forward with evidence "Derek main Anc is not corrupt so certainly individuals within the Anc who corrupt @Nosipho Zantsi I really don’t understand really why would you hate Ramaphosa? Zuma choose his people boys who will defend in parliament don’t you notice in his cabinet and top 6 Viva Anc viva ✊✊✊Ramaphosa viva We will defend ANC not individuals those whom did wrong must face consequences of their action that is what the ANC says May her soul Rest In Peace Turbulent unity is busy investigating all money went out of our country those who bank money overseas hard luck for them we will bring it here back to government @Bridgette Kekana yes he is going to reduce it it is too much Moira T we are in this mess bcoz people were not truthful to our party and SA so they must answer why did they sell our revolution? "Derek main it Zuma who force executive to says that if you remember ANC try to criticize him back 2014 and 2016 Rich will go to jail I said it once more again Let me listen to this evidence guys "Thulani Bukani collective responsibility does not mean that we are leaving you go away with wrong "Jackson Mthembu call Zuma to parliament when he defied ANC to step down "Derek main that is not true brother "We are continue fighting for our people "Psyfrequent Techno you talk like opposition parties they put their thought with your mouth Gigaba will not be in cabinet again If you work together in the future said Gigabytes 😃😃😀 No ways Ramaphosa does not protect anyone Gigaba is in the same team as Ace Magashule so the list combined by secretariat so president has nothing to do with the list Zuma son was in the meeting Ace Magashule son was working for Guptas that is why they took R200 million of stina diary he must account I always insist that We must all support President Ramaphosa to arrestees all of this people Talent P Sibisi he is the only one who can do that if he failed as number ANC will die. Zuma wanted to leave Anc in hands of Dlamini Zuma knowing that he will be safe but he lost and he was shocked
Derek Main,@Theophilus Molatelo Couldn't agree more - only the ANC voters can't see this despite all the evidence at all the inquiries being exposed. Thanks all you ANC voters for the loadshedding. @carnoth ngomane Any party but the ANC - we have seen that they are corrupt to the core. "@carnoth ngomane My take is that I'll study all the party's election manifestos before the election and then decide who serves my interests best. It won't be the ANC "If your choice is ANC @carnoth ngomane I think anyone who has witnessed how the ANC has destroyed SA and still votes for them is a fool. @Nosiphiwo Zantsi Evidence of fools "@carnoth ngomane Did you not read my reply further up? I'm not able to explain it any better - if it's not clear to you "@carnoth ngomane You are right - I do hate the ANC. I didn't always but seeing what they have done to SA has changed my mind. If you vote for them regardless @Nosiphiwo Zantsi The ANC election lists are telling. A bigger bunch of criminals would be hard to group together. And that is what the fool ANC members want to let loose on SA. "@carnoth ngomane You can't fool me with this ""New Dawn"" nonsense. Still the same ANC - even Ramaphosa was there all along." @carnoth ngomane Where's the collective responsibility? @Nosiphiwo Zantsi I'm no fan of the DA either. They're almost as bad as the ANC. @carnoth ngomane Clearly anybody would do a better job than the ANC - I'm happy to let my local stokvel have a go - they'd do a better job. @carnoth ngomane I'll try to explain this one more time (I know you're an ANC supporter). I will study all party's election manifestos once they release them and decide who serves my interests best. "@carnoth ngomane Sorry to burst your bubble - I'm not DA or EFF or ANC or any other party. I don't treat political parties like soccer teams. If hey mess up @Nosiphiwo Zantsi You can believe your own BS - you're an ANC supporter so I know you're challenged @carnoth ngomane Yes - they will - because we have so many fools in SA. @carnoth ngomane Yes - it is their right - it doesn't make it any less stupid. @Nosiphiwo Zantsi Now that is telling too. The very person that would have continued Zuma's state capture is popular among the ANC members. How stupid can you be? @carnoth ngomane Yes it is painful. I fell SA could soar if only we could get rid of the ANC. @makhosi nobhatyi What happened to collective responsibility? To try to blame it all on Zuma is disingenuous - the entire ANC is corrupt. @carnoth ngomane To many idiots around. "@makhosi nobhatyi As we have seen from these commissions @carnoth ngomane No - I don't vote ANC anymore - I've seen the light. @carnoth ngomane And you know this how? I'll never vote for them again. @makhosi nobhatyi OK - so you're now admitting it's not only Zuma. I put it to you that it stretches right down to municipalities - there is corruption at all levels of govt - thanks to the ANC. @African Refugee Yep - the rot runs deep in the ANC. @African Refugee She was probably too honest to belong to the ANC. @makhosi nobhatyi Yes they were - and they are all still there - including Ramaphosa @makhosi nobhatyi You can't fob off all the country's ills on Zuma. Many other players were (and still are) involved in corruption. @makhosi nobhatyi I'm not disagreeing that Zuma was an out-and-out criminal but I'm saying there are many more like him n the ANC. "@Nosiphiwo Zantsi Let's be honest - we should be talking about the ""Old ANC"" and the ""New ANC"" - two totally different organisations." "@makhosi nobhatyi The problem is the longer the commissions go on @makhosi nobhatyi He took money from Basasa. Bosasa @makhosi nobhatyi He voted in parliament to protect Zuma. @Nosiphiwo Zantsi He has admitted that himself - have you got your head in the sand? @Talent P Sibisi I'm no fan of the DA and didn't vote for them. But you have to be a special kind of stupid to to see how the ANC has wrecked SA and then still vote for them. @Nosiphiwo Zantsi Why don't you explain what corruption is then? @makhosi nobhatyi There might be a few individuals in the ANC who are NOT corrupt. I feel sorry for them - it must be hard seeing what the ANC has become. @Nosiphiwo Zantsi So you want to try to draw some distinction between Gavin and Bosasa - semantics. You can fool yourself but not everyone else. @Nosiphiwo Zantsi Huh?!? You are putting words in my mouth - where did I say anything about PR system and corruption? "@Talent P Sibisi As the evidence shows @makhosi nobhatyi What happened to collective responsibility? "@Talent P Sibisi When ANC can't argue on the merits @Frik Brits The ANC uses the collective responsibility when it suits them. @makhosi nobhatyi And yet the ANC voted to protect Zuma time and again in parliament. "@makhosi nobhatyi In fact @Marcus Levack Why? @Marcus Levack Where was Ramaphosa when Zuma was causing all the destruction? - right there next to him. Don't hold your breath. "@makhosi nobhatyi When the ANC says they're strong on corruption The only possible reason you could vote for the ANC is because you think you'll benefit from the corruption. We know it's not for service delivery. @makhosi nobhatyi The point is that a party that was less corrupt could have done 100 times better than the ANC. @makhosi nobhatyi Now that is part of the problem - what the ANC says and what it actually does are worlds apart. They will say anything to continue their plundering. @Felix Muyoba Exactly! @funicanz All the people on that list are corrupt - it's just the degree of corruption that differs. @welton paulse Collective responsibility @welton paulse Take a look at their election list - it's not happening. "@Magda Seguin I agree - if you look at how their elective conferences are run @welton paulse You are describing the ANC @Anne M. Agree - block him.
Lungisani Ntshonga,Morning everybody power again gone cape town international
Londeka Sisst,morning eveybody

Siviwe Slara,@ carnoth ngomane As long as it is not DA.

Greg Stewart,steal okay but not the whole lot like anc
BanditZA,Did they only find out it is old yesterday?
kagiso william,The glass of water is finished already?
P V,there is a lot of info that this man has
Nosiphiwo Zantsi,Ipsos found that South African voters' preference about political party presidential candidates :1. Ramaphosa is at 67.1% (6.71/10) 2. Maimane is at 37.2% (3.72/10) 3. Malema is at 34.6% (3.46/10) "Ipsos predicts the ANC will get 61% of the vote According to IPSOS the ANC dropped by about 1% from its 2014 electoral support. According to IPSOS the DA dropped by about 3% from its 2014 electoral support. According to IPSOS the EFF gained by about 3% from its 2014 electoral support. @carnoth ngomane He always hated South Africa and thus he is spreading propaganda and insulting voters for exercising their choice. "“The DA may not achieve an outright victory in the Western Cape "The poll suggests "Ramaphosa is the most popular politician in the country by far Ramaphosa notches up a favourability ranking of 6.71 out of 10 @Peter Staffen How is IPSOS owned by the ANC? To say IPSOS is ANC is one of the craziest things I have ever heard. The EFF is the most succesfull party in terms of growth in this survey. @carnoth ngomane You got him. He is not as independent as he portrays himself. According to this pol the EFF will replace DA as the official opposition in Gauteng. @carnoth ngomane He probably wishes that his 1 vote counted more. "The Minister of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation "@Peter Staffen The most conservative polster Have you dumped Trotsky @African Refugee ? "“Ramaphosa is carrying the election for the ANC. He has built its credibility UDF was ANC inside South Africa A majority of the UDF leadership were underground ANC members I was there Ramaphosa was in the UDF United Democratic Front Paul Mashatile was a deputy secretary of a UDF regional structure The UDF was an umbrella/ front that had many organisations and led the popular resistance inside the country in the 80s. @makhosi nobhatyi They have no evidence but Derek will keep on lying. This idiot does not now the definition of corruptio "He does not know the definition of corruption Anything that @Derek Main does not like is corruption "@Derek Main CR17 campaign fundraisers admitted to accepted money from Gavin Voting on a party mandate in PR based system is not corruption. Go back to school @Derek Main @Talent P Sibisi He is doing it deliberately
Thulani Bukani,@myanc has finished this country. Our children and grand children will judge us harshly for voting for these thugs. It’s basically apartheid 2.0. He said he will get back to us in 10 to 14 days. 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️ "@talent. What if there is a trend that the people ANC deploys into government go there and do corruption "I accuse them all of corruption. When we were sold the “fire pool” and all through Nkandla none stood up and said no. So for me "@Makhosi the party told us it made mistakes and it took collective responsibility. So if the mistakes are corruption based @makhosi oooohhhh. You want to listen to the evidence now. Oh ok fethu. So we as South Africans must wait for ANC to deal with its factions while it plummets state resources? You clearly agreed with Zuma when he said ANC comes before South Africa.

ayanda njodo,Techno stop being stupid
Francel van Eeden,T can understand people want to stick to their political party of preferance. What I do not understand is how they complain but turn a blind eye to corruption and when spoken about you get lambasted what does it say of the majority of us the voters? We dont understand that we have the power to change our future but we decide to stick to the people in power who brought us in to this mess so if you vote for the ANC you agrree that corruption is ok
Colin Hinks,...and Riaz Saloojee will still vote for the rotten ANC...a very bad habit too many South African voters seem to be unable to break. Anyone who votes for the same unchanged ANC and its unpunished candidates in the next election becomes an accomplice to state capture.
