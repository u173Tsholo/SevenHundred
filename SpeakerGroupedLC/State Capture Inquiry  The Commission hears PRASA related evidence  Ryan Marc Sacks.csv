Heather Durr,@zip reeper Lets hope that the subpoena is not defective and we dont have Ms Mbanjwa's sister Cruella making speeches and getting apologies again. She seems to represent all the hustlers @Teunis van Ree hi there-I am off to the dentist but anticipate that there will be a no show of the Mashaba guy at 2 pm chat later Hi all-So I assume DCJ took an hour to issue a summons for Mashaba @melds Need to have this one taken out so have a temp in-I hate general anesthetic so they will do it in the chair-  @melds melds funnily I have no fear of the dentist provided they give me lots of injections for the pain. I will take an extra Bi Polar tab and then fall asleep in the chair Watching the ******* at Parliament @Naledi Barron Hellooo there gorjus. Do take care and pop in at will Hugs We know why Mashaba is a no show. I mean he was implicated in this whole downfall Hahahahaha Hawks what were you up to  YES We Love flow of funds evidence.

I dont think this is accetable @zip reeper Then everyone would want to make an application LOLOLO Actually no DCJ you need to reflect A lot of reflection going on together with santization Adv Soni is very structured in his submissions and it is easy to follow his thought process  I still think the 5 mil Kitchen is priceless (literally) @Teunis van Ree Hi there 🙂 These two have spent much time together going thru this witness testimony-what a well prepared and competent witness "@melds melds they never do unless its banks involved @Sal SA Hi there @zip reeper and Karens That red pen is priceless "@Stix Mtolo I nearly platzed when I saw that-votes are important  Ok time to start blocking Sharp he is this Advo Our DCJ is truly priceless @Sal SA Yes there may be criminal charges of laundering but in a civil action for unlawful enrichment which is a common law remedy in terms of Roman Dutch law as I recall *unjust enrichment @Sal SA  Yes DCJ absolutely personal liability of the directors in terms of the Companies Act I am so tired of analysts and Cyril for starters Ugh x2 @Jacqui Baumgardt hopefully Deloitte is next DCJ and Adv Soni are kindred spirits LOLOLOL I am sure DCJ remembers LOL Its only in the shareholders register-yes  Subpoena Cosec records

Sal SA,HAVE HIM ARRESTED TOO DCJ. THIEVES!!! "Eventually we'll have ""uBaba and the 40 Thieves"" behind bars" Adv Soni is a brilliant and methodical legal mind. Keep up the excellent work Poor legal advice from his counsel Morning @Valencia @Pastor J.J. Hope u well bro. I think it's better if warrant is issued by a court to create impartiality on a very serious action @Mfundo. And the looters are led by uBaba Zuma who proclaims to be the Father of the Nation. Which father steals from his children? @Valencia. Yes and his followers too @Mfundo. Very sad. There are none so blind as those who refuse to see. @Mfunfo. People like Sabelo are sell outs. Let it go. @Mpho. I doubt they will appear. They are not implicated by any witnesses so far. DCJ u cannot allow this criminal behavior n set a precedent They gonna out of MK vets to guard these criminals run out T break - back 11h15. "@Ndumie. U may not care about the money that was looted GAVIN IS WITH ELVIS 😇 @Valencia. Excellent PI there 👀 "@Lorna. That's nothing new gal. We have looters @Lorna.

So maybe arrange to join the tea party n ask him @Ismail Petersen. Salaams hope u well. No much activity from the RET brigade. Out buying tissues to dry their tears @Heather. is there recourse to third parties that received payments from Swifambo? @Heather. Probably it may classify as proceeds of crime @Heather. Ta "Its mind blowing how they paid such massive amounts in advance. Normally Letters of Credit are used for imports Then arrest the Minister "@Eddie. Well the President get the final report They can get shareholding from the auditors Thats what we did at the bank Call Dr Gasa to testify They say a fish rots from its head.

Cerebis,Another one giving the Commission the middle finger. Time the CC acts against Zuma.? DCJ was too soft on some ANC cadres like Zuma and others.
