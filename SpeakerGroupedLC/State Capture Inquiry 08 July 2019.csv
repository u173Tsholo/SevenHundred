Zibambele Multiworks,who is on the hot seat today? i thought he would rattled by hoffmeyer
Jason Manganyi,Ambassador Bruce koloane According to the website they'll start at 10
PETER STAFFEN,are they starting at nine or ten Moshoeu Mabusela you are not making sense pal Moshoeu Mabusela have read first
MJ,They must declare a national holiday when Zuma appears before the commission! I Agree Yin Yang! My favourite food to eat while I watch this mess unfold is biltong and avo.....no popcorn! "Pastor J "Moshoeu Mabusela Koalane should have been a car guard. Lorna Kavanagh ; yes our Air Force is asleep! Nqobile Ndimande; Totally agreed!
Sindiswa Moolman,It’s gonna be a chaos on 25 July with all Zuma bussed-in supporters making noise and blocking roads outside the venue Protected by his struggle credentials @Magda Seguin. He thinks they will work for him here. They earn more than that when you incl their non taxable allowances @ Magda Seguin. Those allowances can go up to double their basic package. This man actually got a promotion The waterproof Gupta plane landing @lufuno Justice Ramashia Thank you They travel in and out the country all the time @peter port. Even their wives are doing same. @peter pott It’s not him who allowed that @Zila Pinda. That one is next. @Zola Pinda Tito is a confused Minister @Some guy. It’s like he’s running his own show in this government Her ! Hear @Wensislus Qhali Where’s your home? I thought Government is looking into that @Mashieu Mabusela @Mashoeu Mabusela Yhooo @Michael Wild. Don’t know what to say. I don’t think the FF+ has my interests at heart @Michael Wild JZ loves the spotlight. His lawyers advised him not to come here and he goes against that advice @Danie Nielsen. He will not miss an opportunity to school everyone about what the State Capture is. They don’t have speed @I am Free. This one has no written statement to the Commission. He will make stories as he goes along. He doesn’t want to be caught in lie Yes Barbara Yes @Thandi Nkutha and he didn’t submit any statement to the commission @Thando Nkutha Annually can go up to R2.4m when incl their non taxable allowances @Ewald Kruger Some brag that they live on their allowances and save their basic salary @Ewald Kruger Yes @Zola Pinda What a liar. Hope the PA will come and defend herself Exactly @Thando Nkutha This man is lying under oath He must be recalled immediately. He doesn’t deserve to represent our country I agree @Magda Seguin I agree to that too @peter pott. They were all appointed by the former no 1 Painful truth @nqobile ndimande
Pastor J.J,@MJ Odendaal Jorgensen On crispy toast and some salty bacon just forkicks. My all time favourite @Maxwell Sibiya .You are spot on and indeed very right. Sadly everyone that has come to testify before him seem to tell the truth about him whilst he will chose to deny it all. Oh Lord I am gone Deaf. Please restore my hearing I Pray. @Derek Main . I tell you Derek. And in less than 30 seconds. The Lord listens to the faithful. hahahaha @Shweta kitchen healthy and tasty cooking Hello Shweta @Kisten Moonsamy .Did you probably work at Standard Bank at some stage?
clive oconnell,Why can’t this court do a full days productive business Embarrassordor for SA and Zuma 💤💤ANC experts on envelopes 💵💶💸 Zuma enjoyed trips to Russia for bribes for Atomic power plants 💰💰💰 Suit made for hunchback Tell her what todo again
Maxwell Sibiya,"@Yin Yang Tjo.... Why the whispering now?
Magda Seguin,My mind was just refreshed that Mac Maharaj who was Presidency spokesperson at the time of the Gupta landing denied that Zuma gave the orders for the plane to land Proceedings starting at 10:00 "Those who steal are also perfect liars "@goolamv must be "WoW! changing his testimony on who was present at a meeting He was Head of Protocol Yes he is a Zuma acolytes why else did he get an ambassodorship after the Gupta crisis He must have contacts in India...plot is thickening "The uncouth Mr Q is here again Listen to your hearts content to lies "He looks very happy and sure of himself Ambassiders earn R1.4 m plus the same amount in perks His entire CV related verbally He is full f his own importance The DCJ is patient "Ag nee man "As if we dont know It's all above his VIP status *about Tweet like Zindzi and spread hate He has an inflated ego Thank you Judge...shots fired! Tell him to come down to earth and tell us about integrity I dint trust people who speaks of themselves in the third person...only exists do it Exactly @Ibo Thabo 40 minutes of nothing He is verbal diarrhoea Zuma is a thief period.It has nothing to do with capitalism Why dont they address him on his name like any other witness Life if luxury...on taxpayers tab "There is no customs and excise at Wsterkloof "Mo there isn't He speaks hypothetically but not what happened I never understood why public servants are supposed to be targets by the people they serve..I once passed the King if Belgium and his wife on the beach in Ostende with MO bodyguards *NO Since Kennedy and Olof of Sweden no head of state was ever fascinated or had an attempt on his/her life *assasinated Yes I remember but that was a madman not a sniper It was Ngkula in 2013 "@goolamv you are right "Absolutely Pandor is the current minister of international relations @peter pott "@I Am Free I read the document over the weekend NERSA also dint have money...corruption "Thuli handed the Gupta landing over to the current PP to complete but she didn't "Mkwebeni only had AAN7 on TV in her offices when she took over I see that Iqbal Surveys newspapers are spreading fake news about the SARS Commissioner...he and his Ayo newspapers are also Zuptoids This racist narrative about 'whites' in SA being behind evil deeds in a democratic SA where the ANC rule must really stop.It is the populist rhetoric of the ANC/EFF/BLF divide and rule tactics STOP blaming whites we had 25 years of theft but is in denial therefore there is so much self hate SA is now allowing China to take over after the Guptas He is defending Koalani I still think this man has an over inflated ego Titles dont give you integrity and morals Please dont entertain the racists and those trying to cause divisions on this forum.Ignore them.Hate never advances anything. The DCJ is fed up If a Judge addresses me like that I will be very embarrassed..this witness is delusional These are the people that abstain in the UN security council when human rights abuses are voted on...the Rohingya comes to mind I see an African Central Bank is to be established...more looting for the dictators on the continent How can you assume in such an important matter Passing the buck So aviation and DIRCO is not involved? I'm confused Obfuscation of the highest order Liar liar pants on fire Working in tandem with Mkwebeni Salary:R1.4m Perks:R1.6m The ambassador salaries was made public with the Zindzi Mandela tweeting debacle Living large on taxpayers money @I Am Free I saw the skull and bones pictures as well He looks irritated """something like that""" This witness is ultimately responsible for what happened on Zumas orders "The witness who headed the air traffic control explained what happens "Deny The SA public is being taken for idiots @Tikvah Olam you are right 2.9k people watching now Just like Zindzi Out of 57 million I never saw a witness being so defensive My heart bleeds for the youth...57% unemployment. Their futures are being hijacked Nothing about what the Guptas said at that meeting that number one gave permission "@Tikvah Olam 27% is the overall unemployment rate "I only state official credible statistics He knows all the details but deny responsibility

Wildthing,ha ha but everything is now broken strange I did not see him in Geneva. no one new about it but the air force did not shoot the aircraft out the sky because it entered band airspace. for 300 customers going through Switzerland president always rides on the train sometimes in second class meeting Ace so no police escort was cleared too. so all the vehicles used was wrong too. he cant answer because they did not take actions to fire the correct people and charge them with treason Moshoeu you made a mistake you must replace whites with ANC FF+ have good policies for all and may actually be good for SA. Hoolman what do you want from the Government great words Judge They just need to ask Elon Musk to come home Moolman do you know electric cars Tesla is one of the fastest cars on the road he is a traitor now the blame game with start will They should have asked for all details of the passengers to be reviewed before the plane landed. when that plane landed it was the same time when world wide was on hi terrorist awareness. now he is digging the hole bigger. This one is from the ANCBond This guy lies without blinking thatbnbis an ANC skill I mean the Bad ANC members. I an hoping the good take over the ANC.

"Aske this ANC envelop guy how SA on the UN end-up signed with THE coalition of demons to go destroy Libya True @goolamv "The ANC elect a full-time ignorant & careless president to rule them & us as country @Vlerkies lol I think judge zondo played with this diplomatic guy in the last question by the saying my question I thought to ask but now I change & reserve it for someone else and then asked the Q

michael mbatha,I also thought Kholoane was to testify today. What is Matjila's role or position back then in the Gupta landing gate?
Zola Pinda,He's a story teller. let's get on the business of the day. Guptas landing aircraft in our military base. This man must go teach this to international relations students. How did he allow Guptas at our army base. "This man talks like a super Star. Me Is this the man who sold the Republic ? Hè looks guilty as charged. He should have been fired but was awarded He looks like he has enjoyed lots of Indian curry dishes. Yes Zondo will corner him soon.
BEE-llionaire Okwacha,Thanks for the info @PATRICK MANGI @goolamv LOL so the principal has to agree first. So Zuma knew about this and he agree.
peter pott,This is a waste of tax payers money. how come we fly two ambassadors home just to answer one question. we can just bring koloane to table to answer who gave him thumbs up for the landing has this madala dyed his hair? "if we question landing he is talking nonsense. airforce 1 landed at AFB waterkloof "@magda "all the Gupta did ladies and gentlemen. we have been spending too much time on wrong three. we got men and women who are watching our skies as we watching this. permission is sort to enter SA skies.
