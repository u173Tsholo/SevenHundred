Ashraf Thebus,whats this about
Aubrey De Bliquy,about 10 o' clock @Gray Lawrence These are just the little cogs in the wheel. Zuma is happu as a clown lounging in his fire prevention swimming pool. "@pius194 Corrupt people aren't racits @Humphrey Khwidzhili Our poverty is created in the world fiat banking system backed no longer by gold or oil but pure fascist monopoly capital. I hope the ANC cleans up it's act. Corruption has bled this country to death. Eskom is the canary in the coal mine. We don't have time to change government. Our need is now. WMC must be the amest political slogan of the morally bankrupt. Way to go. Let's all hate one another for a skin clour we cant change. Way to solve problems. Sound program management LOL @Louis C and our ladies sit for hours at the beauty parlour with curlers in their hair while our black sisters are staightening their hair with all sort sof products. I prefer them proudly natural @Phumzile Kumalo so true. Nuance is everything. I am tired of politicians trying to make us hate one another for s akin colur nobody can or should change. It is nuts. @mervin harrison I havn't got your land. I promise. I can't even aford my rent. This witness is impressive. Denel was/is a world class company. State capture has destroyed it as it destroyed Eskom. I am diabetic. I can't drink but I can grow weed on my stoep which is perfect. @Louis C I don't know. I was working at High Rising when they were making carbon fiiber dishes for the large arrray teeopes in Chile. It would be sad if South Africa lost this brilliant ability. I have a solution which can save us all from this sorry state of scarcity. We must fast track plasma turbines which can end our need for Eskom or oil or coal or nuclear energy. The best kept secret. @Canis Africanis We can do better. We must insist. Let's just do ikt and not wait for leaders. Their are none who put people first. We are alone. @zip reeper must be the weed. "No @Mbuso Ndlovu He is professional @zip reeper I am watching this while I am making a magnet motor which I am hoping will not need fuel. @Canis Africanis Just give me a piece of land to nurture my family so I need not pay rent to live in the land of my birth. @ncamisile Radebe I see no reason why it wont work other than the fact that 99% od so called settled science says it is impossible. But they have been wrong before. @Rene Ngwenya Maybe because I know denel. It is sad. These people are professionals that should do us proud. Only ignorant bufoons damage such a gem. It is experimental. about 30cm diameter The idea is to reflect magnetic energy into the commutator at transition to achieve reversal. "@Rene Ngwenya But it is heartening in a sense to see the corruption is only at the top @zip reeper Let them come for me. What a blessing to die at the hands of your foe and the foe of humankind. 🙂 @Rene Ngwenya perhaps I would not know that if by chance I had not seen their facilities. They are awesome. We should use them toi fast track new energy for the masses. @zip reeper Life is precious. It is not less precious because it is precarious. @Jacqui Baumgardt Money is based on gold and then oil and now just blood and fiat fascist power. It threatens us all. @ncamisile Radebe Dont bother to make it work. Understand it and design experiments to understand it better. 360 degrees of propulsion needed. @Louis C I am so broke when they phone me to ask for oney I offer them my sympathy and prayers. LOL It is all fiat money. @Rene Ngwenya That iis why your words are more precious. @Singi Mathebula They wanted to win their case. I wish he would stop with this WMC thing. It is so dumb and sterile. I tried my best to stop being white. Staying alive is my first prize. LOL @Louis C My joy is following my dream to bring down he whole scam with free energy for all. It may be possible. We live in a dark age of arrogant delusion. cool more witneses "Appealing to WMC arguments is like the most racist exploitation of the dumbest and most desperate among us I can't laugh at the clowns without laughing at my children. It is their world. I will not be party to making it worse. "@zip reeper No "@zip reeper Be at peace with who we are. We have travelled a long road together and our children will be here when we are gone. I want them to live in peace and prosperity "Awesome 2009 I wonder whee he studied. @zip reeper All whites during Apartheid were not racist psychopaths. "@Sam Monkoe Yup "By the way "It is cool that our constitution protects our sovereignty to use dagga privately @Rene Ngwenya This guy is a professional. Looking for the bad guy among these rank and file professionals is like trying to pull hens teeth.]

Ted Michel,kunamathambo amaningi asadinga ukuphuma
Fred Desrosiers,If he was shocked why not escalate it even to the minister. Or is there no whistleblower process. the SA constitutional court ruled in June that independent individuals should be able to go for national elections. Hope honest people will come out as independents. So people of Indian background are black owned? is that the definition? "Salim Essa at Transnet These things can not be blamed on governments of the past. The current government needs a strong leader who will not put up with this nonsense. Anyone can say they are black owned. Is there a national registry where owners of companies can be checked? "@SanFran Arnold "@Louis C "this witness is a smart and honest man The IP is actually what a company is worth. No way that IP should be sold. Zondo is not playing today. Is he chewing gum?? oh oh. He is begging for another reprimend by the DCJ.
johannes mailula,"malema in court today and vote for who? no Mashaba he will bring new corruption style BLF you joking right ioojoy old stuff papa hehehe! The commission invite any person with a proof of owning land to come to the forth from 1948 DA lost before they can even play its rollover Yes lets vote corruption out of the ANC yeah i agree @Nene ANC is not a problem the member of the ANC are not everyone "@Nene my point exactly Zuma and his fellow looters are not the ANC they will face the music and problem of this other political Parties is they got owners while the ANC does not  I am sick an tired of you talking about apartheid while we still use the very same system to run this country @ kubheka my man to vote for a party of which the founders are still alive is a suicide because we will never tell them what to do my man think about it man @nene you right :sanitizer: @ louis check for the Artist for the following song ( even if she are young she want money )

Petrus Baloyi,hello chair
bongile sango,GM everybody's in the room @Naledi GM This is showing us that people in government they don't care they only want to fill up their pockets. All of this is from that time they were busy rotating the ministers from one company to another. I wish after all of this is done they can reverse prices of Eskom. Because electricity is very expensive since the time of Lynne Brown.
Ntuthuko Nene,@Simphiwe Kubheka I believe Mashaba's Action SA is. Big ups to the Hawks Action SA for government DA has won back Tshwane after the ANC thieves tried to steal it. "People out here defending thieves Mandela said the ANC must be voted out if it does what the apartheid government did. SA belongs to its people not ANC. "@Johannes I dont think we can expect the ANC to self correct. The party itself is the problem. Zuma was shielded from votes of no confidence "ANC supporters in denial will always blame apartheid and pull the race card even on matters that are irrelevant So the NP is too blame for all the thieves in ANC? Wow. Haiti freed itself from slavery 100s of years ago and today they are the poorest country in the Caribbean mostly because of corruption. Will SA blame apartheid 100years later & ignore the corruption?
