Thulani Bukani,she's gonna finish him off now @babette judge decided rather to finish late tonight instead of start early this morning Judge and Hofmeyer need to go out for a coffee after the commission is done its work dating Hofmeyer must be real tough imagine trying to negotiate with her for ukuya emajiteni @cerebis how do you connect the bots with the EFF? whose surname is Masimba now?

I wonder what goes into the minds of those who where governing the country. it was nice pocketing all the millions now grapes are sour. @Naidoo he is not the only one think of our politicians. @Raymond the money that he is not suppose to have. we are now waiting patiently for the evidence of Mgadi. @Sindiswa what matters here are facts period. these connected comrades are mostly greedy. this guy is caught with his pants down. @Sindiswa correct. you have to partner with credible people. if you swim with the big fish you will be swallowed. dudu will have to give evidence her side of the story before cross examing. Kwinana must come and explain herself. conspiracy for corruption in highest level
Peet Venter,SABC's parrafin cameras was cold! Mahlangu is overthinking the questions Mahlango's MBA degree was for Mind Blowing Assumptions Mahlangu the CEO is now the Chief Evidence Ommitter. @Yose Human Zulus are more interesting than what?

Born free,SABC will have to invest in solar battery rechargeable cameras. The lights go out in October. Gavin Watson subpoenaed to answer questions at SARS pertaining to Bosasa and tax evasion. At least it is progress. On the news this morning A SARS Team watching these proceedings very carefully. They are determining who could be implicated in tax evasion. He just said he did not enter into a consortium!!? Wrong Gerrie Nel is not a racist he has represented many black people with the Esidemeni cases. Afriform is a multiracial platform. Afriform is not a racist organisation. You are ignorant just because it represents many white farmers as well as people of colour. There has to be a legal reprensative for farmers in this country. Don't bring racism into this. "Someone has to stand up and protect the hand that feeds you  "It is.  Close links between Zuma and the Myeni's. Zuma has alot to answer for. They were going to steal and divert funds from the taxpayers coffers of another SOE. PRETENDER-PRENEURS Dr Dhawa was pushed aside for taking on Dudu Myeni. Dr Masinda Dhawa Masimba is the doctors first bame It's Dr Dhawa's first name The Dr has an open honest face DUH Zimbabweans better than Zulu's.. Notice no stuttering and Stammering like the previous witness Yes Mr Zuma you found your degree in a lucky packet. heeeheee Zuma how much of looted taxpayers money is in your Swiss Bank Account?? 😂😂🤣🤣😅 Can you imagine how long it would take Zuma to hit one letter on his keypad.. let alone a word Here.. Zuma you had better wear a huggies diaper when you come to this commission in Mid July. ANC have been corrupt since 1994. We know about the Arms deal with Tony Blair the then British Prime Minister.. BAE systems and the millions paid in bribes to ANC and their 1999 election campaign. Some truth there.. Jacob Yes... Zuma I have heard the same about Dudu and you. I think Zuma should be necklaced But Zuma your love child is white?? That word Zuma is going to cost you R200 000 Land issues will have to be done in the order of who settled in the region's first. White settlers were here before the Zulu and the Bantu. Zulus are a tribe /culture if people that came from another part of Africa Jacob.. we will unite when you appear at this commission. Unite against you. No Zimbabwean can be proud of that mad hatter Robert Insane Mugabe. A@ human. Bob was betrayed by his deputy and the Chinese. Mugabe is no hero but a man with a syphillus infested brain. Love David Bowie Mugabe will die a slow painful death What is triple BEE?? BEE is a State Capture get rich quickly scheme. But they want to capture private entities to. @Derek.. thanks.. wow it is very very very broad based. WOW These Mama's walk all over everyone. They will knock you down with their booty The Mama's are smarter and stronger than the men. So greedy The ANC wants to build a Mega City on your land. Dudu Myeni is the Mama of SAA Most of the corrupt are Zumas faction of the ANC I would go into partnership with this honourable doctor anytime after all he is from my birth country. Yip that's why all the letters were unsigned They thought that by not signing the letters would not implicate them. Infact the signing of the Instruments requires signatories therefore they/she are in breach of their fudiciary duties. Intimidation Transformation begins with Corruption Paper trails will lead investigators there National Treasury and DTI also corrupt Trump victory 2020 Trump has thousands of patriots in this country. This communist government patronises communists. True.. Wow so much interference in these tenders. These tender processes must be done as they are done when the World Bank is involved.. very secure no interference. strict protocol is adhered to. yes the whites were the fist black race to evolve first and explore other continents. Thank you.. Proud American Woman.. you ate welcome Bosasa The doctor is intelligent and an honourable man in like the ANC cheif whips and officers The doctor puts them all to shame Go to the beginning of his testimony he speaks about his doctrine and his studies and experience Thanks to the brave and courageous exposing all this corruption and racketeering. Keep Trump out of this.. they are not one and the same. Don't insult my President or compare him to to any President here or in Africa. Rubbish Trump is his own man. You should be referring to that Kenyan.. Obama Obama was the worst President ever The socialist Democrats. .American politics is controlled by global elites. Clinton was expected but went on to serve his second term.. what is that all about? Trump is and will be the best President of the USA. He is not racist but he will call out those nationalities that are terrorists. The ANC has not helped black people in this country. Trump has created many jobs for the Blacks and Latinos and building housing for them. Rubbish what Rubbish.. have you watched his recent campaigns?? he was voted by the voters and he will win in 2020.
Mpho Tsedu,"""...passed away for some reason..."""
Dominic Przybylski,Zero dilligence. @videoboer Spot on. Makes me wonder what he did in all his other contracts he was boasting about. Nothing will be paid back. The money has been blown long ago. Same as with the whole country. There's nothing left. The only way we can pay our debts is to borrow. """To be honest..."" Does the man not realise he's speaking under oath." This man is as clueless as the meat delivery lady from Koroneka. Standard BEE operation where a frontman does not do anything other than collect his share. This guy did nothing except let other people put his signature on documents. I wonder what is in the nKandla bunker? "Heh! ""Maybe not obviously""" He didn't do anything. Only way to save contract is to bribe. His partner was negotiating on behalf of Nebank at the same time - that alone is fraudulent. Why did SAA contract with them in the first place. This stinks to high heaven. We got to forget about race. If our country is to be saved all contracts should be evaluated based only on merit. The alternative is national suicide. The lady is getting frustrated. That's what BEE is - a licence to loot. His only chance for success is to become a politician. Zuma refused to answer most questions Thuli asked him in the recording of their interviews. Zuma is likely to be proved as even more of a fool than this guy. Where did he get his degrees from? @Admire Mathwasa Which university? "@Admire Mathwasa The evidence is that he was acting negligently/recklessly/fraudulently. Not something which matches with a ""great profile""." He did work on it... for about 5 minutes. @Admire Mathwasa there is an unavoidable connection. How did CR get his billions? All BEE operations are becoming extremely suspect. @Thami Ngwenya BEE is going to collapse our country and it won't be an issue who rules it will be an issue of how to avoid starving to death. @Thami Ngwenya We need to find a way for people to take responsibility for themselves rather than believing that somebody else will do everything for them. Individual self-esteem is the foundation. @Thami Ngwenya Apartheid destroyed self-esteem. @BEE does nothing for self-esteem. It indicates that black people are unable to compete without an unfair advantage. @Thami Ngwenya I just know from my own experience that I did not succeed until I learned to believe in myself (self-esteem). "@StINK News Have you read ""The wealth of nations"" by Adam Smith?" There have been three systems tried in the last 150 years - Communism Fascism and Capitalism. The first two have been tried and were proved to be unsustainable. Unfortunately in SA most don't know. In 4th Industrial Revolution the understanding is that the most important factor of production will no longer be land. The most important will be talent. Talent is an attribute of the individual. @Gareth Davies Indicates that honours degree and MBA are not worth the paper they are written on. ANOTHER astute person? Only terrible to testify if you have lied. He doesn't know about foresight. This man did not take any steps to do anything at all. Did this guy actually read anything he signed? Totally incompetent. I don't think this guy could run a spaza shop. @Masewawatla Masewawatlasethe I'm sure he will be interogated. He's a fool or pretending to be one. This man must spend all his working time with a blindfold tightly wound around his head. He didn't do anything consciously. """done so many of these arrangements"" That needs to be investigated further." """misinformation"" puts his testimony in a nutshell." He thinks he's cleared his name? Is standard to emphasize race. @jones21000. This is South Africa. "@jones21000 ""Meritocracy"" (competence) is a dirty word in South Africa." Who is next? Thanks @Anne M. 15 July I want to see Dudu Myeni on the stand. I think Hawks and NPA must testify why they have done NOTHING. Heh @makhosi nobhatyi If the little people like us steal a loaf of bread we'll be in jail the next day. """man described in bid documents as a ""senior project director"" for the joint venture has stated in a sworn affidavit he never heard of BnP Capital until the news made headlines in August 2016"" news24" I think Gordhan is only person in ANC with the guts needed to prevent us becoming a failed state like Somalia. Unfortunately it needs a lot more than just one. Zuma will come across as even more incompetent and dishonest than Mahlangu. I don't think he can afford to actually appear. I think he'll emigrate to Dubai. I think JZ will use same doctor who said Schabir Shaik was about to die to tell Zondo that he would not survive visiting the commission. "@Admire Mathwasa My arguments are deduced from what I witness @Admire Mathwasa Eh? @Admire Mathwasa It seems our processes of deduction are incompatible. @Admire Mathwasa Do you think ANC is exclusively black? @Admire Mathwasa Who else in ANC has been visibly fighting against the corruption within government? What did he say? I blocked fake Zuma. Don't have time for children. Difference between 1 million and 1 billion: If every second = 1R then it takes 11.6 days to count to 1 million. It takes 31.6 years to count to 1 billion. I would have resigned on the Friday afternoon. Heh! Zondo likes his lunch adjournments. SACP is in control of ANC yet they have never stood in an election. Apparently SACP has been the brains behind the ANC. "SACP defined strategy for ANC according to what I have read USSR didn't support ANC from a philanthropic point of view. Once in power they were expected to repay the soviets. That's why JZ was so desperate to give Putin the nuclear deal. Has been their role throughout as far as I understand. What is the basis for the alliance if SACP has not provided any voters? @Mzalwane Mzala I'm interested. What benefit does SACP provide to ANC and if there is no benefit what is the point of the alliance? @Mzalwane Mzala Pleas give a brief summary of what the basis for the alliance is? They have been in elections for the last 25 years. Sorry @Mzalwane Mzala I don't give my email address to strangers. @Mzalwane Mzala That is just rhetoric as far as I can work out. How can they genuinely be a liberation movement if they have been the government for a quarter of a century? @Mzalwane Mzala I probably never will if I accept that we are a democracy and they are the party which was voted into power. @KQ Proud American Woman African population is exploding and fight over land is cause of almost all the conflict in the continent. Is very sad. The new struggle is to keep the country out of bankruptsy. Wish I could say I have some Cherokee blood. Such a nice name. We all come from Africa except for Basques. Asia has a lot to teach all of us.

Felix Muyoba,this guy is a disgrace to the black executives.. @Born free thats great if it is so this guy should get out of business and go and complete (successfully) his MBA and then come back again into business because for now he is a hopeless so called executive.. @Sindiswa Moolman 😂😂 @Dominic Przybylski they can attach their properties and send them on to the streets if possible.. even crooks? @Thami Ngwenya iamgine assumption when a thief is caught he cant give a reason that i didnt know i will be asked about my crime..this guy doesnt make any sense.. just nonsense no man..too many things? this guy is just totally lost. even his employees will implicate him because he doesnt know what he is talking about this guy reminds me of jimmy manyi and adv maleka.. his company should just pay back the money @Nyasimi Geoffrey that is not clever..thats stupid theft he is a fool "eish black people like titles.. am starting to believe him.. "@Lex Luger if you dont know the meaning of an african name just keep quite "@makhosi nobhatyi yes @Lex Luger DBA (Doctorate in Business Admin).. @Millicent Shozi 😂😂😂 @Neo Mongale😂😂😂😂 @Neo Mongale how can the corrupt characters fire themselves? dud myeni zuma.. @Yose Human please stop these comments you are making..

Sindiswa Moolman,Not before he pays back the money and face the law @Felix Muyoba NPA is there taking notes @Floyd Ramoshaba. Their day is coming. Shamila says there’s R3 trillion out there to be recovered. Patience patience @Floyd Ramoshaba Nothing @Funicanz He is not in court now @KQ. He is a chair Guilty @Zama Kubheka He is coming @Jabulile Mazwane. And the Dudu Miyeni after him "You will be disappointed @MJ Odendaal Jorgensen. Zuma will evade answering any questions. He will want to lecture them about the struggle "They will have to up the security around the venue. ZUmas supporters will be bussed from NW I agree @funicanz Let’s hope @MJ Odendaal Jorgensen Nervousness @david cele "I feel sorry for his family. Although they all benefitted from the loot We must thank Thuli @Derek Main and @MJ Odendaal Jorgensen for finalizing her report before this new PP took over. Uqale nini ukubopha uMkhwebane @david cele? It’s not her mandate to do so Hahaha @Anne M I agree @Born free. It’s a pity he’s no longer with the NPA. He was used to loot from the SAA @Thami Ngwenya I think Mogoeng M agreed with you @Michael Michael Agreed @Michael Michael @Anonymous is promoting fake media This letter .. Only South Africans do that @Floyd Ramoshaba Dudu will get sick with a diagnosis that says she can’t travel anywhere on the days she’s called to testify and then she flies to Cape Town. And his legal rep is there @Thami Ngwenya He deserves everything he’s getting right now... with all the monies he got from the SAA. There’s always a misunderstanding with him Wow!!! A misunderstanding of a cancellation fee "This guy must be very rich. Where does he stay How many bags and pairs of shoes does his wife own? Yhooo these dates!!! He is sitting there @makhosi nobhatyi Manufacturing of awarding information to suite their cause ...at its best @makhosi nobhatyi. Playing dumb @james Moyo is next @Michael Michael This guy is a sole Director of his company and partnered with Moyo and the other guy @Michael Michael They formed a Consortium @Michael Michael There we go again with “Hindsight” His contradictions and not listening to the questions is prolonging his stay on that seat stand He just enjoyed the loot @Dominic Przybylski Mr Mngadi is another partner in this consortium @Michael Michael. He will appear here too He is Dudu’s friend @Michael Michael. He was the main man in this tender. He even gave advice to SAA on tenders. He’s trying to minimize his involvement in the whole State Capture project @Innocent Hapazari His answers always need to provide clarity or carry qualification This was supposed to be here for the morning session. Now it’s taking another day. Interested to hear what he will say @Diana Sekatane The Mr Mngadi I have in my mind is an arrogant person who is like Jimmy Manyi Ewe @funicanz He is his own boss @Harold Mash He was manipulated and used. He saw the big R signs and fell for it @Victor. Shame maan. The young man was used. He was used and the Mngadis want to throw him under the bus @Yolo More. Usengxakini umntwana @Thembisa Odendaal. Now he’s behaving just like any 6 year old esengxakini He should have declared his involvement and told the commission that his evidence may implicate him Hahahaha @Thembisa Odendaal Moyo is next. He flew from Zim And not Moyo @Anne M? Thanks @Anne M Dudu is going to be sick @Dominic Przybyiski. You will see. The sick note will say she’s unable to travel. Maybe later in the Commission calendar @Dominic Przybylski Back from a meeting. Have missed anything. Who is this guy? What is this about Zulus now@Yoke Human? Just rejoined this platform. Maybe I’m missing something @Yose Human I thought Dr Dawar is Indian Ohhh ... thanks @Bruce Andrew Thanks @Viwe Soga. A Chartered Accountant with her Audit Firm @LYD online tv. I respected her because of her work as a business woman in a mans world. That’s why I feel so disappointed @LYD online tv. I know her long before she because associated with SAA. She’s one of the competent women I know. Became associated... I never thought she would be associated with corruption @LYD online tv. A friend of mine did her articles in her audit firm.

Mike Meyer,this is not a court of law ... it's a commission of inquiry

Cobus Opperman,Mike Meyer 👍 Carl Schmidt 👍 "No more ""Through you "He just said ""Eish..."""
Derek Main,"@Dominic Przybylski Yes - the more things change @MJ Odendaal Jorgensen That's an old ANC lie. Thuli Madonsela ordered that this commission be established. The ANC had to be dragged kicking and screaming to set it up. @MJ Odendaal Jorgensen You say that like CR had some option. He didn't. @Sindiswa Moolman Yes - exactly. Otherwise this commission would never have happened. You can be damned sure that neither CR or the ANC would have set it up on their own account. He seems to fit all the criteria necessary for an ANC MP. and bare their buttocks to protect him. @Buyiswa Mnyani Do you not think we've waited long enough for the criminals to be charged and jailed? We have run out of patience. @Dominic Przybylski Anybody with their eyes open has known for a long time that the BEE area is full of corruption. It definitely has not served it's original purpose and should be scrapped. @Buyiswa Mnyani Yes I agree it has but I don't know why you are crediting CR and the ANC for this. It was the PP that ordered the commission and the ANC fought all the way before setting it up. @Thami Ngwenya Not for the last 25 years. @Thami Ngwenya No - I don't . But I put it to you that the reason for that is the greed of ANC cadres who didn't want to share the spoils. They have become massively rich at the expense of the masses. @Thami Ngwenya The point is that the current BEE model is not working. It needs to be relooked at. @Floyd Ramoshaba Correct. Pure greed. @Thami Ngwenya You're preaching to the converted. I'm no fan of capitalism. @I Am Free Take a look around you at how businesses operate. The mode of operation is that you screw whoever you can to maximise your profits. @Thami Ngwenya What have you done? @Danie Nilsen I am definitely not wealthy. I have a conscience that won't allow me to thrive in a capitalist system. @Danie Nilsen The capitalist system rewards sociopaths. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU And how do you know that I wouldn't be even better off under a more humane and caring system. @Danie Nilsen How do you figure that? Capitalism is all you've ever known. Are you saying you think it's a perfect system? "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU My conscience would certainly be happier under a more just "@Danie Nilsen BS - usually the people who work hardest in a company get paid the least while the execs do their ""work"" on the golf course." I think there should be a maximum wage. The CEO should be allowed to earn more than say 50 times what the lowest paid worker earns. *shouldn't "That way @I Am Free Capitalism has become sheer exploitation. @Dominic Przybylski Yep - justice is for the rich. @Yin Yang Yes but voters who think would also go a long way to fixing SA. @Admire Mathwasa Of course! Corruption comes in all colours and shapes and sizes. @Admire Mathwasa Mine does - from hard experience. The ANC is corrupt to the core - from parliament to local government. This been shown to be true many times and is being laid bare here at commission @Asser S. Muronga And look at what a mess he made of that. @whitepope5 Too true. Recently the CEO of Shoprite wanted the board to approve his salary of R33 mil py. That means he earns more in one month than a Shoprite cashier would earn in 50 years!!! @Yose Human Sit down. @Millicent Shozi So the ZAPU elite could get land - no other reason. @Born free BBBEE = Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment @@Born free Only problem is that under the ANC it's never broad-based - it only benefits the elite. @Born free Well broad-based in that many people are meant to benefit but that doesn't happen in the ANC's BBBEE "@Nelson Musoliwa The difference between now and then is that Myeni had Zuma's protection then - now is she refuses to appear @Toni Oliveira You mean a s**thole?

How is that control? How many SACP members are in Cabinet? What percentage do they constitute? The apartheid government used control by communists argument to gain sympathy from Western powers during the cold war. When did the SACP define strategy for the ANC?

Kevin Simon,JZ has Robin Hood aspirations. Fairytales running the country. If we had this level of intelligence in our SOEs nothing can stand in RSA's way. Get rid of the dead wood. "Zuma born free. you take the bait very easily. just to reel you in now. Dudu...yooo yooo. It's coming. There is Section 204 of The Criminal Procedures Act. investigate it this weekend. 😁 Yin Yang. It's like we were at war. Yin. I was referring to an article that said out economic contract was only beaten by countries at war. Dudu again......drowning I'm proud of this commission. I think it demonstrates the thoughtfulness of out previous PP. Just be patient. The hammer will drop. Des. Also read section 204.......weekend special project.😂 I have confidence this will result in catharsis. 😁 If that happens. R100 =$1.00 US. What's frightening here is Black on Black abuse. No race issues. The playbook is written if this process fails. No spoiler alert needed. Kirk. Pray explain your view on witness. Sorry Kirk. I understand. Get the CA with no business experience back. she's got some splainin to do.😱
