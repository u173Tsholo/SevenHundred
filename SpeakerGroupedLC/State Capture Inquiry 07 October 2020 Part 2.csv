Thobani Mkananda,❤👋🏼 @Yolo More 😂🤣🤣 Please don't start with your handsome boy again. He is barred from this forum. Find him in other forums @Naledi Barron I wasn't lying about keeping this community a safe space "The former VBS CFO """The used the word 'unfitted"" Mr. Baloyi" @Jongi Cayalli It baffles me. Mr. Truter oversaw the looting investments of the poor at VBS but he gets a mere 7 years sentence. @ALTA 🤣 That Sodi character he thought he was more powerful than he actually is. He bought a new phone in prison and tried to bribe an official while in custody. "@Andre Gerber 🤣😂 He must use state lawyers already @vanessa Patterson Not so quickly. He'll fall slowly because he's entangled in many shenanigans. Be patient "@Mathapelo Mokadi If the tenders would be done away with by the state "@Mathapelo Mokadi The state systems reconfiguration process to allow an insourcing and contractual employment of the otherwise given to tendering @Zalisile ndzala Life Esidimeni recommendations are so clear and direct. Families have been partially compensated but no prosecution has been taken by the law enforcement agencies 😔🙆🏾‍♂️ @Zalisile Ndzala Remember Zuma removed any head of the law enforcement agencies with teeth to arrest and prosecute. But let's give Adv Batohi Adv Lamola a chance. They have a lot of backlog @Zalisile Ndzala I hold an opposing view but I understand where you are coming from. Adv Lamola has no allegiance to Mr. 10% but debatable. @Zalisile Ndzala Thanks my brother. The Hawks are delicately following behind Ace. He will eventually be arrested. Let's just be patient @Zalisile Ndzala 😂 Don't listen much to people who don't understand the intricacies of the law. Wait impatiently. Those pessimists don't have much to do with the law enforcement agencies 🤣 "@Zalisile Ndzala They were acting with impunity. But we're cleaning up the mess. Those judges too @Pheladi Lamola following Ms. Mentoor testimony. He actually did. But I suspect he'll be invited back or answer to the Hawks @Sammy Tlhapi Just type state capture and go far back.

Andre Gerber,Eet hule nog Norman Baloyi Ace said he knows they coming or him. It's going to be Hollywood style Sodi must have given his lawyers money in advance just incase yes but if so he still made sure that his lawyers had enough cash for bail "5hrs ago IOL ace says warrant has been issued Thanx @ALTA
mafuta,the big guy is finishing off with ice cream and chocolate sauce. He knocked that back like the first dop on a friday afternoon i believe there is a sneaky tot of vodka in the water.

Cerebis,Free State ANCYL (EFF?) defends Ace Magashule as NPA closes in. Hope this is real and not fake news!? I see the ANCYL says that he is being sidelined to facilitate WMC. Here we go again. Always somebody else's fault. All those VBS Crooks must be jailed. 7 years seems too little for stealing old people's savings? @Bantu Sodaba OK Thanks for that info. I respect Judge Zondo very much and mean no disrespect. Has he got bigger over the years with this work on the Commission? Not enough movement and too much tea and cookies and lunches.? @Vanessa Patterson Correction.....Had some nice cars?

Peet Venter,A friend of mine was s scentenced to 19 years for cooking the books to the tune of R2.4mill. How can these scentences be so different? The state actually paid Sodi's bail. He used the money he stole from them. Hau!
Kevin Simon,This is a low energy witness. Sodi used his ill-gotten cash to pay his bail. Bizzare
Jenny Whitewaves,@Peet Venter I understand this is part of a deal he testifies against others and gets alight sentence "This guy on the board to rubber stamp. He questioned the suspensions @zip reeper agree 100%
Stand for Truth with Khustaz,Low energy witness😂😂😂😂

Rip Torn,He is more confused And they wanted to finish with Baloyi before 1.00pm 😆 Baloyi has a lot of valuable information but it needs sharp interrogation to extricate. Seleka is up to it but needs time. Yoh! Baloyi is starting to be impressing The Devil is always in the detail I never knew Baloyi was also removed!!? Very very strange You are correct @Lee D. Hendrix The board used the same tactics to get rid of Baloyi - shem. He is gaining confidence as a witness How the f is the board able to do as it pleases with no regard for protocol!!! This is now another enquiry being unearthed +2 billion? His current testimony is showing how the board operated - it had little ethics. Nooow I understand too! Blok die bok? 😉 "Baloyi is no idiot Correct @Jenny Whitewaves. "lol Whoever assisted Baloyi legally - let him down lol @SanFran Arnold - I would first due them then fire them! *sue I am with you on that @Pheladi Lamola
SD Gudunkomo,Mr Baloy wants to cover a lot of this in one sentence. ...things. yes Thando he's got the information but find it difficult to express it correctly So Zola got the job after he had been recommended by the Guptas but he didn't know about that? how possible is that? """Hawu"" Zondo🤣🤣🤣" are they letting it slide?😊 Msomi he has change to a representative😆

"Save for the chair of the board Worst they allowed the chair of the board of another parastatal to medle in their affairs and took instructions from this individual as well.

Believe in the hereafter. "These politicians care only about themselves politics * "The people of this country must learn to appoint worthy leaders Who cares what language you speak or what's your native tongue? What matter is that we can communicate to each other We are all one family so if you wanna be the person who causes more segregation then you will be separated "The english did global conquest "If black people wanna be alone on their blackness then go ahead Racial segregation is a tool for demons to use to cause more problems and division amongst us.

Goaten -,Roza I am here.. Roza what is the best way to commit suicide without having to feel pain? I can't go on like this..I am suffering Roza I don't have a gun.. Heather you don't feel pain if you overdose? I want something that won't make me feel pain. Roza I am suffering my friend. Baloyi is shangaan. I said something that doesn't make you feel pain Yolo More. Roza no I am sick and have been evicted because I couldn't pay my rent . Only reason I am on YouTube is because I used the R50 I had to buy skara data bundles. Naledi Barron I didn't know and I never thought I would contemplate suicide either so I am sorry. Roza I just think the only way I could end my suffering is killing myself. What is making matters worse is the nightmares I am having. I just woke up now because of it. Naledi Barron I may have said some vile things in the past out of anger and frustration but one thing I have been consistent about is my career being sabotaged. It is true. I wouldn't lie about this. Roza I was in the legal department Naledi Barron the thing is this forum may have someone with a heart of a samaritan. I have seen white people help their own kind on platforms like this. Roza lol I don't think these people will ever believe me bro . I have been villianized . Roza I was earning something but it was shortlived. Hi Wim Louw how is it? Naledi Batton you are really making my life more difficult. Not that well Wim Louw. Roza I took a break from this watching this thing because when I think about the money wasted and the fact that I am facing eviction over an amount of 5000 is heartbreaking. Naledi Barron can you stop accusing me of things I didn't do? Wim Louw facing eviction bro. My apartment Wim Louw. I am feeling suicidal. Naledi Barron I can't concentrate to be honest.Put yourself in my shoes then you will understand how difficult it is to focus on something that doesn't help me with my predicament.

David Lekalakala,Those who are corrupt must face the full might of the law - finish and klaar.
Kopz Koape,The corrupt politicians can never face the wrath of the law when the legal system its self is corrupted An example of a corrupt system is the judges can be bought off.. Remember judge thokozile Masipa..Also some of Zumas cases like the rape case was dropped because of the corrupt judge "Also Bheki cele was found guilty in an inquest of being corrupt but he never went to jail The same with nomvula mokayane..It seems ANC ministers are above the law @Naledi Barron..Yes i concur..But this commission is wasting time and money then "@San Fran Arnold.. Who has been arrested lately..Even if they arrested  I think post apartheid South Africa was at its peak economy wise when Thabo Mbeki was the president..It was a mistake by the Anc removing him @Naledi yes..Also during Mbekis era as president SA was a more stable and happy nation.. Remember how simple life was back then @SanFran Arnold..Mbeki'd statement in regards to Aids was indeed a blunder..But i forgive him @Naledi Barron..Hmm i dont know about Mandela but that is another topic
Queen K,basically board members are useless they have allowed corruption to run down SOE's while they were getting paid handsomely.. this is nauseating. Lady B all of them were cut from the same cloth? 🤔 do we have Dolly Paton?

A sizeable number of the English can’t speak their language so people should not equate speaking English well as intelligence If they can interview him in Tonga that would be great as he will then not be limited by language that is not of his mother tounge! Wake up people The Chinese speak Chinese and deliberate in Chinese and are Educated in Chinese snd look at how far they have gone! Tsogang! Vukani!
