He must've over stepped sometime "@African Refugee I block because I am not going to argue with someone who believe that their way is the only way. If you are gonna spew racist remarks @African Refugee that's the problem. I will fight you if you are racist and sexist. Don't call me names and compare me to a minority of right wingers. I will not stand for that My opinion is that you are mentally unstable if you are racist 🤕 PWHC again involved.... I hope DCJ will now take something for the coughing

He keeps correcting her @African Refugee Just google that slogan again before you embarass yourself. @African Refugee I think its also a bit painful with the experience he has to watch a junior flounder trying to get into drips with a complex testimony like this. @Cameron Kim Ya your eyesight issues are well documented mos. "@African Refugee There was a magistrate in Alberton. Jeez man "@African Refugee Turned out Meneer Nel was plagued by PILES
Nosiphiwo Zantsi,The working class trust the ANC. @rohan barnard I agree. "A provincial chair of the ANC is in jail @Johnny Cash You said no ANC member will go to prison for corruption in your life time. What about John Block? @Cameron Kim The tribal law statement is insulting. Rather talk of customary law. There is no tribal law in South Africa. There is customary law Black people are not a tribe. There can be tribes within black people. Who is your tribal king @Musa Bakiti I agree.

Bongumenzi Nxumalo,"Corruption is corruption "Adv September is just a sleepover waiting to happen Musa Bakiti 😂😂😂😂 "Alexander Dowding Calm down wena "Derek Main But you know "Alexander Dowding That is true Almost thought Mxolisis Zondo pheww😅 Dropping of cases was just through brown envelopes.. pity some have passed on nje "African Refugee I agree Panday haha.. a proper Anenias Mathe😂😂
Derek Main,"Corruption is spelt ""A-N-C""" @Bongumenzi Nxumalo Expecting the ANC to fix corruption is like expecting the Ku Klux Klan to fix racial prejudice. @Bongumenzi Nxumalo Of course we have to deal with corruption but the ANC can't be trusted to do it. Royalty is an archaic concept. They are nothing but parasites. @Musa Bakiti That's the ANC I know - corruption at all levels. @Musa Bakiti I disagree but you believe what you want. @Musa Bakiti There is a degree of corruption in all countries but the ANC have perfected corruption. The scale of their corruption outstrips even Nigeria. We need drastic measures to deal with corruption. I recommend chopping off a hand of the guilty. "@Musa Bakiti What for? If the punishment is effective there @Musa Bakiti Seriously? How old are you? @African Refugee I block people who spew racist bile. I don't need that in my life. @Cameron Kim Please provide any evidence you have. That's like the pot calling the kettle black. @Cameron Kim Pathetic "@Musa Bakiti What is? When you have something significant to say @Thando Nkutha Is Batohi an ANC member? @11soccerdad Kim is trolling - ignore it. @Cameron Kim YAWN @African Refugee Cheers. Enjoy! @Thando Nkutha Nah - Agrizzi is corrupt. That would be more of the same. Booysen I can agree with. @Cameron Kim We bow to your superior intellect. @Sthakathi Khumalo Were they criminals? Were they resisting arrest? "@Sthakathi Khumalo If they are trying to kill you @Cameron Kim Why you shouting? Calm down. @Cameron Kim OK - don't mind if I do. @Sthakathi Khumalo It is alleged he killed Lieutenant-Colonel Concho @Sthakathi Khumalo I don't want to give the impression I condone extra-judicial killings. That is such a murky story though. @Sthakathi Khumalo It may well have been that this story was to discredit Booysen as we have heard of other such cases. @Michael Wild Kim is best ignored. @Sthakathi Khumalo I don't know that he went to congratulate them - he may have gone to investigate circumstances. The fact that he went in a helicopter is irrelevant. @Val Speirs And that statement is inherently racist. "@Sthakathi Khumalo I agree - I hold no candle for Booysen. If he is guilty of a crime @Sindiswa Moolman Great - let's wait until then. @Sthakathi Khumalo On point RE Ramaphosa @makhosi nobhatyi You've been suckered by the promises - AGAIN.
Musa Bakiti,Please Johan don't play with Zuma's family @Bongumenzi Nxumalo It's Adv April Not September yet. Happy for chair he sound fine today.Hope his wife fixed him @Alexander Dowding I am not well payed and it's my way of steal what they steal from me Who said that no one is above the law? @Cameron Kim In tribal law the is no corruption Afrikaaner tribe is new black thing @Nosiphiwo Zantsi Vorword Chair Zondo agree everything in Zulu If you vote for ANC you will get two sassa cards @Derek Main name one country that is not corrupt 100% @rohan barnard we need to send Zuma there to learn 😂😂😂😂 @Derek Main Join Islam and go to Iran Derek Main is a Muslim who eat pork "White person wrote it  @Derek Main keep your liver for Vodka Amigo case ? @Cameron Kim EFF will sort them out soon @Derek Main that's rude Mayibuye iafrica @Yvonne Morudu Thank you my the black spirits bless you. @Cameron Kim Eugen Tere Blanche was our tokolosi we killed it.

I THINK THE WESTERN LAW AS PRACTICED IN SA IS WAY OUT OF TOUCH FOR IMPLEMENTATION - TRIBAL LAW LOOKS LIKE THE FUTURE FOR SA "@Sthakathi Khumalo  THE PROBLEM IN SA IS THE DIFFERENT LEGAL LAWS.

Andiyazi lol guys! @Bongumenzi Nxumalo mfethu please tell me how many people implicated in this whitewash you expect to see going to jail? @Bongumenzi Nxumalo kulungile boss We need to remove all MPs from parliament that have been there for longer than ten years. Because their mental faculties have been compromised due to suffering from apartheid hangover syndrome. It is time for born frees to replace them. Young blood in parliament will herald real change We need minds that are capable of thinking outside of the box. The current crop of MPs are unable to do this. This advocate is a beautiful lady lol Pour yourself a bells and chillax. Life is too short PWC are brilliant. Best accounting auditors in the world. Has President Ramaphosa promised to bring back the Scorpions yet? South Africa needs them back. Best fighters of corruption in government we have ever had. Hence why President 783 had them disbanded.
