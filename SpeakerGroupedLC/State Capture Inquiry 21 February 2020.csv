Erastus Malakia,watching it
Just watch this Guys,please teach him how to pronounce 'determine'
EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,You sure you can not teach him yourself hahaha. Clearly failure to pronounce that word does not change the overall point they set to articulate. true I am layman. But appears to me that is going to be laid bare later. The guys leading are quite methodical. Do not discredit Zondo. No need. He is just chairing and directing the commission. Any one could chair that. Zondo asks for the general population to follow. He is cool. Respect. Not called for Non compliance simple is their langauge to indicate serious irregularities which clearly in other words is stealing was rampant. @Marcus spot on! DCJ is sharp. Look he is proving his mettle! ü§£ü§£ü§£ Not really he is not giving these guys any rope. He is just helping so as to give a clearer picture! stop on Tjo Seriously trouble is brewing in the corridors of power!
Ibo Thabo,I am still straggling to understand why some South Africans particularly those lenient to a particular individual not want the state capture continue and these mess known to the Public At least she accept that she did deserve to be in jail @Luvuyo Zantsi
Khaya Nkonki,Hoping after all the state capture is finished we will see people on the wrong side of the law will go to jail
Tinashe Mangena,Hallo @Khaya Nkonki are related to Nkonki Inc? Just asking for a friend. üòÄ
Jean-Pierre Le Roux,So according to news reports ...there will be no arrests for state capture. It is the law...
Paul Buchel,Agrissi and five others are out on bail. They were arrested.
Amanda Watson,"@Jean-Pierre Le Rocks in the head likes to talk shyte. The full statement ends with ""until at least the end of the year""." ‚ÄúIt would not be prudent to act on information and evidence now until the Commission makes a determination on the matter ...‚Äù
Nkululeko Nyandeni,unless on cases where a witness admits to having committed an offense in line with tje terms of reference and the evidence is concrete.
Mamen Ripoll,..
Gerda 7,üëç They should all go to jail...te whole board!! A very long tea break??
hlengani khuvutlu,"@luvuyo
Vuyisani Sikobi,The problem in exonerating Dudu is that she has been involved in many shady activities and she seemed to have political influences "Obvious coverup "Do not think judge is advised on a/c issues
postmaster,this witness is protecting the other bribed beancounters.
Maryann Diamond,true please tell me what is this guy saying amen me too there is no law and order in this country true
Antoinette Meyer,lol@beancounters "examples Vuyo you think someone is at least informing the judge on a c. "but Vuyi
Derrick Paul,"Dont be so surprised that the audit firms were corrupted
Pravesh Gokul,Sars should do an lifestyle audit on Dudu and that will put her in jail sooner than later.
Dominic Przybylski,"""11 alarming charts that show the South African economy is in deep We are going into governance(law and order) shedding. This is just fiddling while the country is on fire.
Mbuso Ndlovu,Zondo was born confused My father used to attend the same skool with Zondo. Zondo was not the fastest learnerüòÄüòÅüòÇ @lordmore Karanda Sorry we can't run Zimbabwe for you Le t me get back to work. This is what i get paid for @Maryann Diamond This guy is trying to be famouse here. They must let him go he is boring We need action
Anne M.,@Luvuyo Zantsi Mbuso is just trolling to get a reaction. @Phillip Cwazibe üëè "With such a high number of irregular items "DCJ Agreed "No "@EDWARD ZVAVAREYI Yes
lordmore Karanda,This is what is needed in Zimbabwe now. All found to be corrupt must be jailed
Phillip Cwazibe,@ Mbuso Ndlovu ‚Äã Zondo is a judge now. Your father?
D Thomas,"Hi all "Please note what is going on here. If 80% of a sample selection is deemed non compliant of cause they should have expanded the sample size and carried out substantive checks
Mashudu Tshikororo,Ndaa
Moleti Moseki,ndaa
clive oconnell,86%üò≥ thievery Bet they all got big Bonus as usual üí∞ "All key words ie Workshops
Makwa Choma,Anc is in charge
Vish Govender,This seems criminal. This person who is an auditor has an obligation to report criminal behaviour to the police. There is a practice in this country to give the real thieves a pass on criminality. Police and NPA and govt depts in general steal public money because they can and worse still how there cover each other and we as the public are powerless. Honour among thieves and f# the people. Miss Hofmeyer is a darling to listen to listen to. Havnt' admired anyone more. hollywood should recruit her. Loved to see her compassion when handling Mr X application for in camera hearing "The ""mess"" is thieving and you did not report to the police? Then what can one say about you and your duty as an auditor." yeah Mike don't hold your breath. Commissions in this country has been a TV Soap . No real accountability. Isidemeni is proof of that.
Marcus Mmola,Can the judge seek clarity from witnesses not guide them on what they can say to justify shoddy work. The PIC commission was combative but this one is too accommodating for toxic info. its true we are still waiting hopelessly for VBS circus to be resolved if any. this are the very funds looted to be used to sponsor political careers for some politicians and their organisations.We are in trouble.
MIKE DURBAN,@Marcus Mmola .......i say the same etc The DCJ Zondo.....does this very often etc... I realy think DCJ Zondo is great........but often he is just toooo accommodating....... MAYBE....giving all of them rope.....to hang themselves etc...... I just hope and pray that he will not be captured/influenced etc later on by the ANC.....in SA...Anything is possible.........but I hope not.. When I see jail time......I will then believe etc......until then.......not too convinced I don't trust The System...at all. @Maryann Diamond .....too true.......very sad indeed... I want to believe.......but I just can't.... I think many South African will feel the same way.....dunno If we could only get rid of the Commies/Socialists....what a great country this will be... @Moshoeu Mabusela ....So you will vote for them even though you Top Bra's are all corrupted etcetc...... Cause if the DA did that......i would totally not vote for them.......now that is the way to think Bra..... @ Lee...........better than Communism / Socialism.....ne @Chef Brown ....but the ANC are supporting them......true @FieliesSA ......spot on Bra @Chef Brown .....absolutely...100%
Mvuyi Mpithi,"Problem with AG "Also IRBA is just a dog without teeth to bite
FieliesSA,Bring Mrs Hofmeyer back. She and Zondo has much better chemistry. OOEEFFF! Bombshell!! "I also think Judge Zondo is the best candidate. He is slow Its sad how the government is opposed to react on these for a better future. Yet they are so involved and implicated it makes sense they want to stay silent. And this as we put them in power "As John Steenhuisen said in the response to SONA "But @Christiaan du Plessis But what scares me is where the x-ANC supporters are going to...? Has Maimane created his political party yet...?
Anele Sondlo,DCJ is really clear
Lee D. Hendrix,"...Polani Sokombela IS SPEAKING ABOUT THE ROOTS OF EVIL. THE WORLDWIDE PUBLIC SUFFERS FROM THE CORPORATE EDUCATION SYSTEM's VENUES ...The US Dept. of Commerce mirrors Price Waterhouse and eat SA "...If one notices ...Cyril is President of the Corporation of SA ...ANC Corporation
Nomonde Dr Nolutshungu,AG has come to testify on what they found.
Ricus Ellis,"Well There is 8 Million plus unemployed people in the country who will again vote for the ANC since it is the only Party who historically speak to their plight
Pheladi Lamola,Is he saying 2 hundred and 8 or thousand? South Africa really has money. Or at least had. People just allocated it in a corrupt and careless way @Chef Brown it's hard to imagine who isn't corrupt in the ANC
ShaRon Stone,"Judge Zondo is such a fair and bright man along with his legal team. I am proud of the work they are doing at this commission. I hope people will see the inside of jail cells @pheladi SA is bankrupt. They don' t have money "@ pheladi SA is bankrupt
Moshoeu Mabusela,"@Ricus Ellis The majority did nothing wrong by voting ANC. is better than those who disenfranchised and discriminated against the majority. ANC liberated us from apartheid
Yolo More,208
Chef Brown,"corruption has nothing to do with being an ANC official "@mike Durban
Christiaan du Plessis,There is literally corrupt people in the stop structures of the ANC. And nothing is being done. Stealing food out of peoples mouths. Yet people still vote ANC.
Andr√© du Plessis,"dudu just broke for lunch she hungry
