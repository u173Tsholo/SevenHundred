fikile mbokodi,did he get a lawyer
Hloniphani Ndlela,so almost 80% of ANC leaders will go to court after #state capture bcoz most of them are involved icluding our puppet president this is just worst of money. State capture for me it's just a gossip place where they want talk about each other..no results..just creating hatrage.
Anne M.,"@fikile mbokodi Yes *Buthelezi @rosalind gerber I think it was the Regimens money that has been recovered "@Person of interest Yes You're right about that Roza - out and out theft "First let the Asset Forfeiture Unit do it's job @SABC Digital News Please check the sound - there's an echo. @Gee Peex1 Huh? @Handy Mohale You're right I think he's the former Head. Not sure he's still employed by the Free State provincial government
Themba Mdlalose,Why do people say it is a waste of money to find out what happened to taxpayer's money?????????
rosalind gerber,@Themba Mdlalose exactly has this commission cost more than Vrede? she is a viper he seems to have respect for her not like the poor evidence leader earlier this week come clean Thabete!!! admit it was a bad idea or else forever seem stupid sounds like laundering does anyone know why there was no chat this morning? orange over-alls come on Zondo... hehe i want a hole in Ace Vrede has cost more than the commission? I thought some monies are already recovered likable? I wouldn't I'd employ this clown @Roza essack exactly - and you would probably have done the job 'indian monopoloy capital' he'd have to look hard to find a moving train in SA it seems like the chinese fish-farmers had more success than these clowns @Lee Hendrix ??? @Damian van der Berg the ANC seems to place no credence in the environment nor encouraging slower population growth that was over my head thanks madonsela has also lamented over the lack of environmental focus. we dont have the resources to habour a growing population's need for water and electricity i'm sure he was willing thabete is still employed at Free State Department of Agriculture and Rural Development wwwwe wwwwe never exactly sorry - his profile has not been updated his linkedin profile is not up to date no privelages haha Estina At least Col Naidoo apologized - this 'liable' guy is arrogant 'likable' @Lungisani Ntshonga well said Jacob's attoney would never stand for this line of questioning @Gee Peex1 I'm sure this is more pro deo than pro bono is he sweating? @Person of interest if he was more useful
