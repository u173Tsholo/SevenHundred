I am not interested in long winding irrelevancies "@Dan Brown @sboniso mchunu Yes an extract from the B/S of Eskom-thats and no documents showing cashflow Exactly it is not Liquidation-it is a payment arrangement with all your creditors to avoid liquidation Oh me being dumb-now I understand what DCJ has been getting at relentlessly @Diane Louw :thanksdoc: "@Diane Louw No @Diane Louw I get the impression that you are very sharp actually-you don't suffer fools @Valencia J Cheeky Chaskalson up next but we are getting closer to home with the numbers so I am hoping..

Lee D. Hendrix,...these old ideologies are not in the temperment of Today. No performance or legal standards were applicable in and during apartheid dominance. "...People really need each other to kick around "..What's next; Politicians have become medical practitioners to maintain a budget "...@Angelo Doubel; FOR SURE "..goofy Trump tried to reenter the coal industry in the USA "...Plainly ...Pure looting and deceptions with taxpayers'money. "....Where coal is purchased for Africa "...Imperialist should have to prove their worthiness in Society ...There must be reason for herds of foreigners flocking to SA. "...What does a President do in SAfrica and what are the duties ...It appears that Zuma and Molefe had a Justice in their pockets./// ...Zondo must attempt to collect voluntary- evidence/ self incriminations. ...A lot of orange jumpsuits could provide more light at night. "...The old man wanted a bigger and larger part of whatever was going on "....Surely

Dominic Przybylski,How many 'connected cadres' available for deployment? 1 000? From an adult population of 40 000 000? @Rob Nel @Heather Durr sarcasm/irony is hard to detect when body language is not visible. @Khustaz Mtwentwe Transport is huge cost if mine is not close to power station. That's why the contracts are 'evergreen'. @Khustaz Mtwentwe Sure. Is okay to review but not based on any particular period. Instead base review on cost and quality. If no-one else can compete on those basics the period is irrelevant. "Cost of producing energy escalated due to corruption 60% overstaffed all with hugely inflated salaries. 60% of Government revenue goes to public sector wages for 2% of population. This guy misunderstands or misrepresents the problem. Prepay 'in stages' is not prepayment. He should join the delinquent director whatsapp group. Either he was complicit or alternatively a stupid fool. Who takes an anonymous ('businessman') email address seriously? @Lee D. Hendrix Goes flying around the world attending cocktail parties and having fun with other presidents. The chairman of the board of the country's biggest SOE doesn't know what business rescue is? Now claiming ignorance/incompetence after claiming that he is one of the only few competent cadres. "@Khustaz Mtwentwe ""innocently'?" Nothing innocent about Ngubane. What he pretends to be surprised about has long been ventilated in the public domain. I should probably stop watching this. The damage these people have done to this country and its people just makes me so angry. The average school child is as competent as this man appears to be. spin doctor """It's unfortunate Doctor doesn't know what anything stands for apparently. This man thinks everything is a joke. I hope (probably in vain) that one day he gets to realise that this is no joke at all. This man thinks he avoids all responsibility by looking the other way.

Richard Onyango,Lies. The IP prices have come down significantly. How are coal fired power plants closing when we are literally still building Kusile and Medupi? Ngubane lying. IPPs are a small part of the energy mix. Seleka dribbled him there! How is a prepayment also a payment over time on delivery Dr Ngubane? Surely call records can show if he contacted Daniels to ask her to draft the resolution for Koko and DMR? Proposed owner Chief! You said you didn't know about the issue of the prepayment until Daniels came to you so how come your own evidence states it was part of the acquisition discussion prior to that! Ngubane has dribbled himself. Clearly they had already agreed on Tegeta as the purchaser of OCM and pretended to be running a wider process. Seleka is an assassin. Very dangerous man!
