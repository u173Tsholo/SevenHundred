Thanda Sibisi,Who is this male “Dudu Myeni” @Suade. Does it really matter how the (WMC ) press treats Pravin if he appeared at Zondo commission? Just think Kwinana & Dudu. He is shifting blame and trying to throw others under a bus @ Fezile Willem Ramaphosa IS a rand billionaire worth about R 6 billion from several sources. How he raised that money?🤷🏿‍♂️ @ Jabu Malinga. Support fo political parties is not always rational @ Jabu Malinga Many people have issues with DA &EFF need other “credible parties” to teplace corrupt ANC This Salojee ( not sure of spelling) deserves yellow overalls . Period😡 @ Batbara Sattler. No doubt about it! Isn’t Ramaphosa a RET president? How did he make R 6 million ? BEE or did he invent something like Shuttleworth? @ wandy Zoloe. I agree. However he was BEE empowered by the ANC. It was not corruption but was not “ normal business” that made him R 6billion. @ Zenith 344 Exactly! @ Mog OnlyHe is cross nighting for black friday!😏 @ Goaten You believe Pravin will get roasted? He is not swueky clean but I doubt if he engineered the theft of billions!
DokoloCity,cremate myself.. yes you are already cremating yourself This guy was a thief real one don use work email address @Freddie Van Rhyn Pravin and Trevor are chief thieves but untouchables @Naledi Barron explain @Naledi Barron lets have coffee and debate it.. but the two combined made significant contribution to the economic policy SA @Sonwabo wiseman mhlaba someone hacked and sent it CIA & FBI can do that
Maruping Thetele,Indeed @Michelle Wright
S V 1,look where the money went and they want to throw more billions at SAA .. the mind boggles ! this is a lot more incriminating than trying to wriggle out like Kwinana ! if this goes to court and found guilty how much jail time do you guy's think he will get ? 10 to 15 years ? jirrie hierdie ou het mooi geskep !

zola mfinci,he is zruminal is this man going to answer any of the questions at all?
Heather Durr,He is sliding off the chair @Naledi Barron They can compel you 2 answer questions in court unless you plead self incrimination. A witness is privileged only against replying 2 questions which may criminally incriminate him They need to get the software WHO uses for its media briefings-it is superb @S V 1 8-12 years for fraud at most plus a Section 300 compensation order in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act Plus Suspended sentence not allowed to work in a financial position ever again He is going to fall off that chair or it is going to overturn "Do those chairs have wheels SMH 9.1 million doctors worldwide Kate is much more matter of fact with this type of witness. 'indeed' and moves on without comment Hurry up for heavens sake make up your minds Adv Sikhakhane throwing his toys at the CC HURRY UP MEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! By the time you make your decision it will be 5 pm-hurry up. Get to it @David Tuer I dont waste my time on indoctrinated denialists who spin the same old same old theories-I know the truth. He can think what he wants With respect he is not as well prepared as Kate-I suspect his juniors did the footwork and he went thru it once Chaskalson is used to arguing principles in court-look at his CV. Not this detailed minute interrogation of documents Mabuza sounds just like rambling flowery high level detail devoid Ramaphosa Maybe we get to see Kennedy who is up next YAY Now he sounds just like Grootes who rushes thru everything like a locomotive to meet the 5pm deadline Mr Bean @Andre Gerber He was throwing his toys I want to see Denel @Naledi Barron . Ok Thanks-it should be interesting then as they are showing it with Kennedy I think-they are bringing it all together I trust which is great YAAAAAAAY Kennedy and Saloojee And they want our support for the strike-pathetic I love Twitter ............Thank you Twitter and all other forces BOOM BOOM and what about Supply Chain Did this guy know what was actually going on in his Company or did he just waft around picking up bits and pieces doing lunch Sigh Yawn Jy lieg! @Naledi Barron Yes absolutely @Naledi Barron Too many times to count Mr Kennedy is rightly offended by this issue @3RDCREWTEK @Naledi Barron Hilary Clinton must rue the day Podesta clicked on that link I once had to advise the board of an SOE that they had to resign due to the conduct of the shareholder (Government Department). That does not happen in the private world @Jabu Malinga There are no jobs. This Lockdown has instilled in me a completely different perspective and respect. How our unemployed can live off R 2000 a month is nothing short of miraculous who said he was told that it had become political-was that Burger Burgher was being pushed by VRL methinks Get to the point behind all this-the real reason they made these shocking decisions. Yes DCJ I am going with the sinister plans "DCJ is so frustratingly but adorably and professionally tied to structure and reliability. Drives me crazy @Naledi Barron 😘 Passive Aggressive gotta love them Kennedy sounds so sinister when he is making his point Like he found the body they buried in a shallow grave😂 "Moving along...as I said yesterday after Burgers resentful ruminations on BBBEE @Naledi Barron Sidelining of people of colour in the corporate world due to resentment at what is perceived as an easy ride to the top and prejudices regarding their competence "Oh hurry up lolll Remember that cheeky secretary/Legal adviser who wanted to scuttle the whole deal and gave him a MOU "Please be rude Adv Kennedy DCJ keeps the peace........Dash it Yes or No answer please

Soe's dit not collapse due to theft. the also stole but did not empty the store at least under Apartheid a black person went into a government hospital he or she had a 99.99% of walking out of hospital. now if whites or blacks go to provincial hospital. 99.99% of being carried ou thami ngweya then prove me wrong. them Isa odendaal kindly read up. I never alluded that apartheid was moonshine and roses. as a matter of fact I always voted against national government kopz koane so what has changed if at all kopz koane at least you had a 99.99% of walking out of that hospital. now you have 99% chance being carried out feet first kopz koane I grew up in cape Town all the people in cape provincial hospitals black lndia white got the best treatment. and they have langa and other communities there put all those black nd clrd communities together then just as big as soweto oooooo Friday going to be so interesting. already got my popcorn popped and salted ready for the show think I will use my privelidge on my wife when she asks. where have you been? may I not answer incase I incriminate myself 292 million eish can I have just 1% of that 292 million was adv chalkason not a judge at one time? thanks guys you cn see who he learned from suade convince DCJ Zondo to stand for president I will be happy to vote for him no matter his party I used to have great respect for pravin Gordon. now I have none left for him suade if Dcj Zondo stands for president no matter who his party is. I will vote for him. I have no allegiance to any political party Aubrey he wants to use people pension to save SAA and he appointed unqualified people to important posts now he is hunting whistle lowers. we all know what happens to a whistleblower

Communist dont steal and live luxurious lifestyles.. ANC and EFF are far from being communists .Living in mansions and driving luxury cars defeats the purpose of communism @Mike Durban. No i dont think so..If someone preaches socialism or marxism but steals from the poor to enrich themselves then they arent true communists. You sound ignorant @Antoinette Meyer.. That is exactly what i said they are theives and psudeo communist. Whats so hard to understand about that?? @Mike Durban. Ok correct me..What is communism??? "@Mike Durban. Just think dude if this was a communist state there would be free education @Dominic..I dont understand your question "@Mike Durban..Ok ill ask you is SA a communist state..Cuba @Dominic.

One may never know the truth @Helene..David mabuza will be president I wonder what kind of president mabuza will be if he is elected..Is there anyone clean in the ANC???..

Ok but why cant he remove bheki cele or all the useless and corrupt ministers??? @Phakamile..Do they have something on Ramaphosa??? That Ramaphosa doesnt want anyone to know about? @TW. Bheke cele was found guilty of corruption that's why Zuma was forced to remove him @Phakamile..I wonder who are in the 1% who are squeaky clean??? ANC is self destructive let the party destroy it self so a new party can emerge "SA needs a new party because EFF Some people have faith in Herman Mashaba and his new party but i wouldn't trust anyone who was in the DA @Gugulethu..

Swamp Donkey,refusing to answer to the commission will not save Mr Invoices in court his answers suggests he is already facing some music. i hope they have taken all his Malawi Diplomatic Passports. Mr. Mathematician has hit a mental block. He has checked out from the commission. DCJ has made up his mind on this guy and will request the Secretary of the Commission to prefer criminal charges against Mr. invoice. I wish the SIU attaches all his underwears and socks.

Cmon let us be honest. Watching paint dry is better than this. Waiting for the day that tsotsi called Pravin Gordon will be cross examined.. @Mike Clark - How did we become a collapsed state? Should we make a white person a president? Lol you will see how biased this room will be when Pravin Gordon gets cross examined😆 @Mike Clark - The day of Pravin Gordon cross examination is the 30th right? @Freddie Van Rhyn - Zondo is a long standing member of the ANC. .. Pravin Gordon was definitely one of the key players in state capture but the captured media treated him like an angel. @SanFran Arnold - When is that tsotsi Pravin Gordon appearing before the commission? @Mike Clark - LOL didn't you see a WhatsApp group of captured journalists? @SanFran Arnold - Pravin Gordon is a tsotsi. You are just protecting him because you are also one of these captured people. Did you even see what he did Sam Mkokeli? "@Mike Clark - I can send a screenshot of the captured journalists to you via twitter if you want ? or I can tell you some of the prominent journalists who are captured right here  @SanFran Arnold - If Pravin Gordon isn't a tsotsi then Jacob Zuma is also clean. Yes? @Mike Clark - Karima Brown is one of the captured journalists and is on the Thuma mina WhatsApp group. @SanFran Arnold - No I know your kind. Only black people are tsotsis to you. Pravin Gordon can't be a tsotsi because he is Indian. Despite the fact that his own former advisor exposed him. @Mike Clark - Another captured Journalist is Xoli Gambi.... Let me write it down @Mike Clark... Yeah I followed you @Mike Clark.... Will send you the screenshots. @SanFran Arnold - Okay reason why you are saying Pravin Gordon isn't a tsotsi eventhough he has been exposed by Sam Mkokeli his former advisor? @Mike Clark - Did you see the invite? @SanFran Arnold - Why are you ignoring my question about Pravin Gordon? "@Mike Clark - EFF has long suspected that Karima Brown was captured and an ANC member and all of that was proven when Sam Mkokeli former advisor of Pravin Gordon Yeah followed you just now @Mike Clark. ....I will send you the screen shot of captured journalists once this thing is done. @Mike Clark - Another captured journalist is Adriaan Basson😑 "@Mike Clark - Karima Brown is still very much an ANC member.

Pravin Gordon whom we all know by now is a tsotsi is being protected by the usual..the likes of @SanFran Arnold however Zuma is being tainted I didn't get your reply @SanFran Arnold... @MIKE DURBAN- Cyril Ramaphosa is owned by white capitalists like the Rupperts and Oppenheimer. @SanFran Arnold - LOL are you playing a prank? Because your so called response is nowhere to be seen. Ask other chat room users if you think I am lying. . @SanFran Arnold - Nope are you sure it is not getting deleted? @MIKE DURBAN - Not sure about that. I don't trust them personally. Nether do I trust business dealings done by Cyril Ramaphosa. @SanFran Arnold - If you used the word crook they are deleting it. I have seen it with mine hence I replaces it with tsotsi. @SanFran Anorld - Wait others can see it? @SanFran Arnold - Let me change profiles. @MIKE DURBAN - I don't trust a politician including DA members. @SanFran Anorld - LOL let me switch profiles. @SanFran Arnold - Can you type it put again? @MIKE DURBAN - How do you know DA is the lesser of the evil?
Aubrey De Bliquy,If I remember the advocates agreed to ask the questions he was prepared to answer first to speed up the proceedings. Braamfontein? Thats convenient. Can we expect a Constitutional court snap judgement soon to compel Zuma to testify? hi Did the Constitutional court say Zuma must testify yet? Have new dates been set for Zuma to testify yet? Did the Constitutional court say Zuma must testify yet? Isn't ACE ANC? All these detailed questions he is afraid to answer are part of the record. Thats why they do it. @Suade - ​All these detailed questions he is afraid to answer are part of the record. Thats why they do it. @Suade - All these boring questions he is afraid to answer are part of the record.

We have a mind and a soul. @David Tuer Not this. Liberty or death. there is no identified virus which is an existential threat to humanity more than the existing reaction and measures and the menace of a fake vaccine. @David Tuer Even if you look at this virus profile from a eugenicists point of view it is the profile of a gardeners pruning rather than an attack on humanity. We should ignore it. Older people are vulnerable because they are weker and less perfect. Children are striongest from the womb nurtured with love.

Piet Vast,ANC = corruption ANC = tyranny Volgens mij heeft Malema Sindisu Magaqa voor de bus gegooid. Begraven in tenders. "Goed Afrikaans. Is is geen Nederlands. Is een aparte taal. ANC = corruptie "Ik kende een NL bedrijf. Werd geript door Toni Ehrenreich. In opdracht van de ANC. Vertrok toen naar Thailand. Textielfabriek in Zuid Afrika. Omzet vertienvoudigde in die jaren Was gewoon afpersing door de 'union' = persoonlijk $$$$ voor Toni EhrenREICH(RIJK)........ Kijk. Malema wil alleen maar 1 stroomdraadje naar 'workers on the farms'........Maar ondertussen wel 'workers' EN Boeren beschuldigen en vermoorden. ANC Corruptie verlagen GEEFT ook LICHT ANC attackgog Malema in Senekal : Protecting the institutions.......1 week later......We will visit policemen aan huis........hehehehe ANC attackDog Malema in Senekal : Protecting the institutions.......1 week later......We will visit policemen aan huis........hehehehe Leeft die vriend 'Zulu' van de 'rechtgezette' Magaqa nog ? Dat gedoe met die tenders is 100% ANC corruptie "Kijk Zuma op een grote gele opblaasbare eend in het Nkandla zwembad 'fighting for the poor' Die Ronny Kasrills zegt het niet met zoveel woorden maar volgens mij leerde de ANC industrieel verkrachten in Teterow DDR. "Kijk Waarom hadden die landen allemaal zo'n drang om de ANC te installeren ?!? Corruptie is zo'n beetje het enige wat groeide Stel niet uit tot morgen wat je VANDAAG kan doen De ANC bedreigde de beroemde Thuli Madonsela met de dood. Mańana mańana Niet uitstellen tot morgen wat je vandaag kunt doen. Zuma geniet ook al in 'z'n' zwembadje Zal de heer Zondo zijn graafwerk overleven in deze ANC tirannie ? Soweto deed veel stof opwaaien. De hele msm over de rooien. Maar na Marikana........no problem ANC = corruptie ANC = murder ANC = massmurder ANC = Genocide Klinkt goed. Maar Sindisu Magaqa spreekt niet mee over de tenders ? Ligt Zuma daar onder de tafel te snurken ? ANC = vette pensen voor de 'cadres' ANC = taking lives without compensation ANC = moordfabriek ANC = miljoenen doden ANC = mama Winnie gewoon even voetballen met Stompie. En Nelson KNEW ANC = hand grenade on the car of the righteous Thuli Madonsela ANC = Malema 'zal noooooooiit een eigen partij beginnen'......Klopt EFF = ANC ATTACK DOGS "ANC = 'vrije en veilige verkiezingen' ........heheheheh violence before ANC ='normale misdaad' = 25000+ moorden per jaar Malema voert nu ook campagne tegen 'rape'.....Maar da's juist de grootse ANC 'kracht'...om 'orde te handhaven OK. Die Terreblanche is ook vermoord door ANC beulen "Kijk Ik zag vorige week een EFF 'protest'. 90% was te dik. Niet van het werken. Was een 'vreedzaam protest voor 100 protesteerders' ......IK zag alleen al 100 criminelen op 1 Boer. En........police arrest the Boer. Leek meer op een ANC aanval op de West Kaap. EFF als gewelddadige stoottroepen "ANC ook voor nutteloze mondkapjes. Ja ANC = corruption ANC = slavery ANC = tirannie ANC = lets turn a hospital into a shiiithole ANC = free 'education'........leraar vreet brood op van de kinderen "ANC = 1 bruikbare Grippen ANC = NWO ANC = $ 1000 per seconde verder in de schulden "ANC/EFF = 'where do we get the moneY'........OK ANC = SAA with broken wings on the ground Ja. ANC = stealing pensions form the workers ANC = gele t.shirts for the poor and fur coats for those who are 'more equal'.......NO doubt. Boston Consultancy ?

No food more deaths. ANC : 'we killed Hani because he was too intelligent for us'....... and of course we will get Walus and Derby Lewis...... btw Clive Derby Lewis was tortured to death by the ANC "kijk ANC = corruption Malema : Malcolm X was murdered by the Boers ANC = corruption factory producing loads of corruption and deaths "ANC will be gone in 5 years from now ! Exposed as thugs ANC = corruption Denel ? ANC : Shaka created the Rooi Valk. Mooi. Weg hier. Adios. ANC : it was the right thing and correct thing to kill Magaqa ANC : it was the right thing and correct thing to butcher the miners at Marikana ANC ; corruption is right and correct ANC : it a moral thing you know ANC : infra red hindsight on a Rooi Valk costs 10x the market price. Correct and right. Not correct nor right. But an ANC murder squad killing them all........Some countries have courts.

I just find this lawyer boring.Maybe it is because I am used to the energetic Kate. And I also wanted to debate with Bianca @SanFran Arnold - How about we go out next week then? @MIKE DURBAN - You do know that what you think of DA now is also what most people thought of the ANC during apartheid right?

Go and look up what I have just told you on the Internet. Type Pravin Gordon breaches whistle blowers ACT and see what comes up That is why people are losing respect they initially had for him. He is just like the rest of ANC corrupt officials. Media has just treated him well because they are captured. "@Naledi Barron - Not sure about Trevor Manuel but I think that insurance company he was a chairperson for No problem @Naledi Barron... Yeah thanks Old Mutual. Trevor Manuel acted suspicious in that case...very very suspicious. All these media darlings are turning out to be not as the angels they were portrayed to be. @L. M - What do you mean that I am mistaken? I also used to respect Pravin Gordon but everything that is coming out about him which most of it is suppressed by the media because they treat him with kid gloves is just proving EFF right. stuff though @L.M - Yeah you are right. But mostly those are the coloureds with black heritage... @Naledi Barron - You are right. One must apply logic but based on the latest developments you can see that Pravin is guilty as a sin cos his own advisor resigned after challenging him. @L.M - No you are right. I just completely forgot about the dynamics in the term coloured. @Naledi Barron - Yes that will be okay.. Yeah search Goat My account only has one follower😕

lufuno shumani muloiwa,Ramaphosa may lose that motion of no confidence 🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️ @Mzalwane Mzala remember many of the ANC MPs & Deputies will soon be facing criminal charges & evidence is clear. if they keep Ramaphosa it will be suicide for most of them. The worst is yet to come @Phakhamile Khuzwayo Remember its now about avoiding jail time by most ANC cadres including Ace. this commission exposed most ANC MPs shenanigans as Bathibile has said @Mzalwane Mzala maybe that but it will soon be a secret one.. they are buying time. Do you remember Zuma's motions? @Thabo its just a matter of time..most ANC NEC & NWC members are implicated they cnt keep a guy who will soon send them to jail one by one..thats what ACE is fighting for @Mzalwane Mzala Yess but remember the ground must be created first to assist the speaker to decide rationally soo. thats why i said they are buying time & this motions is the first of many to follow @Kopz DD was cleared by ANC integrity committee.. He is fully fit to takeover 🤣🤣 @The Case brought by The EFF to Constitutional Court.. the judgement touched about fairness
Jabu Malinga,but ramaphosa is also a bee millionaire just lik his brother in law Motsepe "TW  "Thereafter  what is Rainbow African Minerals ? lol..that company was formed initially to hold BEE deals.. go do your research and learn your history please This guy wil soon start saying he wont answer as he does not want to implicate himself "The other company known as TUB "Thata uBeke Manufacturing ..TUB "public servant means what? a minister "they job of public servants should be given to retired doctors "Their should be no status attached to the job of minister "why does a public servant "Phakamile "recent by elections "Is the real reason why we see shacks and informal settlements in colored "Phakamile "Employment would solve many problems in SA. idle criminals wil now hav work to do. Gansters wil find better live in factories why build pit toilets and match box houses when it would be better to use that money to build factories and manufacturing on a huge scale so ppl can buy their own houses??? "look at china
TW Ntshingila,"@Jabu Malinga which minister has been found to be corrupt by the court of law? @Kopz are you referring to a PP report that was overturned by a court? No court has found Cele to have been corrupt!! "I hope the chair is guarded by more than two people

Tom Speirs,"Ask the witness what the definition of a "" Mandate"" means to him." All these implicated persons are from the Zupta era. A Motivation of money laundering. "The "" Mandate"" is the key to approval." A pattern of non compliance exists in all the procurement processes. VR Laser was duped into partnership by the Gupta's . Hope this answers all your questions. VR Laser is a Benoni based Steel company. Hopefully they wrap this up before the ghost shift. Golden handshakes for criminals and no charges . This man was responsible to close the loop. He clearly did not play his Role. The Gupta thing she takes no responsibility what a spineless being. If he had done his job he would not be under the bus.
