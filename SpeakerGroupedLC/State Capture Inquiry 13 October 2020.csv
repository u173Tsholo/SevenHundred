Getrude Mthembo,no sound for me sound please!!!
Fred Desrosiers,Isn't there a conflict of interest doing business with Guptas while in position to give them business in Eskom? "@Phil Rambau My opinion is that it was him feeding Mr. Howa and Esa what the board was going to decide. they must get Esa before the commission. They should just ask him if he was the one who gave out the information or receive the the information. Mr. Selaka is not making much progress. the issue to me is that this witness was doing side business with the Guptas and sitting here not admitting he was the one feeding the Guptas with info why are they re-reading this!
Nkosiphendule Mafidi,They must be arrested and rotten in jail
Balanganani Abraham Makhani,😁 😊 eNCA sound is low quality like their journalism 😁 sound got poor quality today 😳
Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ,...sound got transferred to the JUJU trail ..it's a conspiracy.....this Cuban sound will make us sick. ..like the American embassy people. block your ears. 👂 ...go to another channel bye I'm going away. trojan trojan 🦓

Ndamulelo Ndou,😁😁😁 i think Chair has that thing that can pursued a person to telling the truth😁😁😁 "@Wim louw "@Wim louw I hope Dr Ngubane doesn't turn out to be a Layman 😁😁😁 "@Blake yogi
Kevin Simon,Ngubane does not look like a happy camper. Perhaps he uderstands how he was played. DC has it absolutely right. Someone very senior on the board. Perhaps the chairman? 😉😂😂😂😂😂 19 to 30 March is too long a gap for someone to know😊 Perhaps a time machine. Takes South African politician to debunk Einstein's theory of relativity.
Gugulethu Dube,This Ngubane board should be charged with conspiracy to commit corruption with the Guptas "He is ANC
Maboko S,Dr Ngubane was a proxy Gordon Nefdt ANC 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Answer Dr Ngubane He is cornered for sure 16th to 20th of November Zuma's date to appear we just have to wait and see if he will come But this time I think he have no chance "He's now blaming Zondo There was no media statement They must simply go to Jail He is still lying The doctor is lying
Mzalwane Mzala,Ngubane was not played. He went around SOEs enabling state capture. The demand for Zond's recusal is just a tactic for not wanting to appear at the commission. He is a medical doctor "He graduated MB ChB in 1971 from the Medical School of the University of Natal In 1991: Minister of Health in the KwaZulu government @Diana Sekatane I never heard that he left the IFP and joined another party @Derek Govender benefitted from apartheid Only beneficiaries of apartheid can defend it. Listen to what @Kiss The Boer Rac!st KILLA is saying. Why Koko was brought back? @Khanyi. AgeGracefully Ignore puppets
Gordon Nefdt,Dr Ngubane is IFP or ANC? Why he left IFP???? Proud of Commission and advocates in keeping cost below R2 billion Better than Trevor Noah Show Anybody knows latests if Jacob Zuma will appear before Commission again? Advocate Seleka is poisoning himself slowly @buyani ...he does not read newspaper clippings? End questioning now...going in circles @Brian. ...Yes @willie ....this is not a court of law..Judge can decide on balance of probabilities @Brian...Yes :o @Arthur ...I don't think so. i think he said he had spent it already. Mr Jonas loved Sunday City Sun City Wow....now truth is coming out by Dr Ngubane!

Kopano Mnguni,contradiction @Warren Manning the minister approves @levy manaka he is medical doctor that practiced in apartheid. @Derek Govender black people were allowed studying medicine at the time @Arthur Nieklaassen no brian wont pay it Jonas lied under oath I have no doubt. Dr Ngubani has always been fond of Brian Molefe.
Russia Magezi,"Elton Dr. Ngubane looks like JZ to me "Our own was a gangster state
Tay,He should have refused to sign the Minutes! Adv said WE WILL KNOW... This will not end well Handling of the Board? Seleka bites The Guptas appointed him! He has confirmed the capture @levy manaka He is a medical doctor DCJ is tired... He is a ruthless politician Ms Mbanjwa is is mbanje or weed in English Aaaah?
Diana Sekatane,"corruption doesn't care as to that you are educated or not Yes Blake he received the corrupt money alone... It is really shameful for people who are earning a lot of money but go on doing these bad deeds and claim to be christians.. it is time that voters are to make an informed decisions when voting. Steve they must see in their circumstances that there are no services. Steve this is really sad.. Levy greed knows no colour gender and otherwise education. this doctor brings shame to his family. he started well and was with Buthelezi at IFP but now I don't know.. He was appointed as an ambassador.. "If the parliament can change the voting system Yes Michael look at the PPE'S

Lucky Ramosedi,take out the names
Steve,Where do they find these scumbags to commit these deeds? "If it was not such a shame to steal from the poor with the help of these scumbags that wanted their right to pilfer and steal and he also defended Brian Molefe to the hilt "Diana "Diana Surely he cannot be a Dr of Medicine Lifestyle Audits are a waste of time Blaming the Guptas is the most common excuse.

DokoloCity,Businessman how do you get a medical Dr on a board of a utility company.. madness just! @Steve Lamb apparently he is a medical dr "The one thing i have noticed in South Africa I think one of the recommendation from this commission should be that all board members must be vetted by a parliament and they are ask what skill set they will bring to the board before appointment and also gives the public a chance to point inaccuracies in their CVs
Peter Lukas,"this crook is smooth 
Pheladi Lamola,Is Dr Ngubane still adamant that Businessman was not Salim Essa?
MUSA HLUNGWANI,Suzan Daniels has confirmed that Business man is Salim Essa
SilentHunter_ON_WOTB,Just follow the money and do life style audits on these cheesy characters I wonder if they all shop online at loot . co . za The real problem is that the average ANC card carrying member never hold their ministers to account ... yes agree with that I'm sure the Guptas were equally cheer leader'd on by those who benefited from all the looting "Even If all the stolen money is ever repatriated "The only real doctor is
Derek Govender,We can watch this comm till dooms day there will be NO jail time for anyone. This is just a smoke screen for the ANC to save face.Its more a marketing ploy.

SD Gudunkomo,aha Tsotsi😊 Tsotsi is seen as clean but not according to Ngubanes😂 Yolo you can't say that.Ngubane tells what happened unless you know something please share with the commission I believe Ngubane on this one Gala because he was there he's not telling imagination or singing media speculations Gala it is experience. Gala except others are doing it for media praise and for bread and others for their lives I don't trust media reporting because it always pushes certain narrative see the chair is speculating.
Sundie Nells,DCJ is great-intelliget logic and memory! An asset that we need. Maybe he should be asked so serve at Intelligence!
