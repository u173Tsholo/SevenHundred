Graham Jackson,Jeep DCJ pedantic on pagenation but time for us when they say would start seems to be ignored Well there is saying that the wheels of justice moved slowly
Mbuso Ndlovu,WHO IS IN THE HOT SEAT TODAY @Anne M. Thanks Does Zondo brings his own lunch or he takes from the commission? how much is Zondo charging a day by just sitting and say Yessss...Yesssss. Yessssss ?????? Zondo is triying to dig the whole truth Who brought the Guptas into RSA??? I'm back
Anne M.,"@Mbuso Ndlovu Former National Director of Public Prosecutions DCJ was able to study law with the help of an Indian shopkeeper who provided his family with food every month. DCJ also told the story at the hearing where he was being interviewed for the position of Deputy Chief Justice @Pastor J Not . the kind of trauma one gets over "@Magda Seguin Agree @Cerebis Yes üëç
Michael Mika,he must just pay back 17m
Pastor J.J,@Diss & Dad How are you my Precious friend. U was missed. @Lorraine Naidoo How are u doing Lorraine. I pray you had a blessed weekend @Thando Nkutha We missed you my friend. Welcome back @Diss & Dad U are absolutely right. I was at the house when the killings happened. @Lorraine Naidoo U are absolutely right. It was a Muslim shopkeeper in Ixopo. They still run a scholarship programme together. @Diss & Dad It was painful and traumatic. A lot of that anger from then still exists @Anne M. Definately so. Pain. Anguish. Anger and a very deep sense of loss. They were an amazing couple who I new closely and very personally. A deeply loved couple @Diss & Dad Absolutely. Sadly the bad deeds where actually executed by non-white security branch policemen. @Born free I must agree with you. You are right it did happen @Diss & Dad They received bonuses for special tasks. @Diss & Dad They never did hence the lingering and continued anger by so many people "@Diss & Dad In the late 80""s I was the courier for some docs into Lusaka. I cleverly booked into 2 diff hotels. I had supper and went to room and then slipped away to the other hotel." @Diss & Dad An hour after the supper the room was bombed by the same people I had supper with @Diss & Dad In those days your left hand should never have trusted the right hand So am I Bless them. @Diss & Dad Absolutely. The regime was ruthless and there was no hesitation to eliminate any level of threat. Even a non violent person like me suffered some very painful moments @Born free You are right my friend. A lot of sacrifices for the nonsense we have now makes it feel somewhat useless at times. No one knew better @Magda Seguin At least we can tell the difference but painful @Thando Nkutha Unfortunately not as many as I would like too but mabe Ministry played a big part for that @Thando Nkutha Those buggers where ANC members based in Lusaka. Askaris absolutely @Thando Nkutha We have all changed in different ways. I am sure that they have regrets and I have tons of forgiveness to give @Diss & Dad Absolutely brilliant people hahahaha @Magda Seguin Absolutely right Pleasure my friend @Lex Luger I try to tell you everyday that I love you my brother. You are special bro
Sindiswa Moolman,R10m @Michael Mika. The rest was taxes Maybe they are still setting up the audio You are missing som zeros@Lorraine Naidoo. You must also note that that handshake was taxed. The taxes went to SARS. So he owes us the difference Hope the commission will ask Zuma to pay back this R10m instead of this guy. This man went through a lot in few months he was there.
Kercy Pillay,"no he should  zuma used taxpayers money to buy himself out of trouble
Lorraine Naidoo,what's happening did he disappeared Pastor had a fabulous weekend thanks so muchüòó Eish I think all the evidence missingü§£ü§£ü§£ here we go They trying to take out the frog from zuma throat. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ I salute Judge Zondo. Judge Zondo became a lawyer with the help of a Indian shopkeeper. He got a golden handshake from Zuma for R170000 Diss he was interviewed on tv nd told his story The same shopkeeper gave his mom vouchers every month . Google about the story . Pastor Judge cried whole telling his story
Zaahier Adonis,Taxpayers lunch zondo is taking a nap are you ready Stellenbosch Mafia the Rupert and Oppemheimers they are masters yes but still masters my friend Yes Rupert is danger and oppenheimer its all about the money
Rob Nel,Four Bossassa guys were arrested. Out on R20k bail each "can not recall names "@Magda Seguin

barbara broadbent,"Whats happening
SNENHLANHLA VILAKAZI,üòÇüòÇ
Born free,The big fish.. Gavin Watson of Bosasa must be arrested. "Agrizzi and the other witnesses who worked for Bosasa The absolute end for Jiba. R17 million was offered "Zondo asks many questions Definitely Not one of Zumas Keepers. Zuma did not know he would be a witness at this commission. I wonder what Pastor J looks like?? "I believe and have read and seen pictures of the terrible atrocities and murders the freedom fighting terrorists commited against Africans Zuma invited the Guptas Terrorists/Freedom fighters had Cuban and Russian handlers. SA is ruled by the communist party. Many people paid the ultimate price. Yes and look at the country today.. is it any better off?? I think the R17 million was very attractive to him. If I was offered R17 million I too would have taken the offer. I know Jacob was at the meeting I did not live in this country during apartheid years but statics report that this is a lawless country and the highest crime rate in the world or very close to it. He would not have been paid R17million if the CCMA was involved. Yes it was a golden handshake I think he was fit but he was pushed because Jiba wanted his position. Zuma and Jiba enabled each other. Nxasana was fit enough and not politisized. This man was and is a stand up man. We know Zumas faction had everything to do with his dismissal. It was Jiba and Mwyrebi "I believe that Nxasana could not go against the Zuma faction This was in 2014. State capture began in 1994 but escalated when Zuma became President in 2008/2009 "Yes Malema said "" We will kill for Zuma to be President ""." But who appointed Adv Nxasana Can someone apologise for this 25 year old Regime of corruption?? You got that right Stop the racism At least Capetown is delivering unlike the rest of the country. Viva DA EFF are the jokers of the pack Every time the EFF opens their mouth.. it costs them money and unfortunately the Rand takes a dive. No I am a lion and poaching was unheard of. Bring back the Dinosaurs Nope. The two ANC factions are going to be at war with each other. I don't know if I have that much faith in Ramapoesa.. Tata Ma chance.. Free masons are not a satanic cult far from it. Ooops.. spelling error . Ramapoesa. Faulty keyboard My neighbour is a Grandmaster and there is nothing of a sort . I can't withdrawl my keyboard won't allow me to . They have wasted so much much time. break... break... break

Ibo Thabo,When Zuma is coming back to the commission??? @Thando Nkutha most of the time most of the people here are not following the full time so it might be hard to update you Guys didn‚Äôt this Nxasana‚Äôs name mentioned in various documents including the book The president‚Äôs keeper‚Äù that he is one of the diehard Zuma‚Äôs keepers? @Derek Main But didn‚Äôt on the beginning he was Zuma militia? @Daud Musa how do you know that he was not there? ok
Ewald Kruger,üòÄ Please keep your backward practices off this thread @Thando Nkutha ‚Äã @Pastor J I've been praying spiritually I've been with yall Trying to take credit for something here ? üòÄ @ Lorraine Naidoo ‚ÄãJ udge Zondo became a lawyer with the help of a Indian shopkeeper. "üòÄ üòÄ üòÄ really..? @makhosi nobhatyi ‚ÄãThis won‚Äôt happen
Nelson Musoliwa,Thanks Rob Nxasana never asked the president(Zuma) to approve his vacating of his post at NPA; Zuma was clever to leave evidential trails in his dealings suspecting even that Xnasana will record him so his reluctance to meet him
Nikiwe Nikiwe,arrrest the criminal please
Norman Zwane,"@whitepope5 ""The ANC cannot be expected to commit suicide. If the ANC were to remove all criminals from their lists "T@Khaya Nomoyi If Zondo's recommendations will affect the party as one in government
Khaya Nomoyi,To me this was just a waste of money.What happened to the recommendations of the Marikana Commission.Its still gathering dust at the President's office.The same will happen with this one.
Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Nothing to do with Estina - it's about how Nxasana was axed by Zuma and how Jiba & Mwebi plotted to get him fired from NPA. They supported Zuma's enquiry on his fitness to hold office. @Thando Nkutha No problem @Thando Nkutha That's right - it seemed like hush money at the time. And highly irregular. @Ibo Thabo I don't think so - he wanted to reinstate charges against Zuma and hence he was pushed out of NPA
Toibo wa Toibo Antimba,@Derek agree
Jabulile Mazwane,you're absolutely right Lorraine Naidoo
Magda Seguin,Bombshells coming this afternoon "Makhosi nice to see familiar friends ...I missed you We Africans always fight against each other.Nothing changed in 25 years.This is a perfect example. "@jasper dougal he is preparing the witness to withstand cross examination The DCJ will never expose himself to be seen to be partial. whomever thinks he is biassed is not au fait with judicial ethics. @Pastor J I often think what my life would have been if it was not for apartheid and how I had to flee the country as a very young woman I had so much hope in 1994 when I returned to SA but now find myself again in another continent.I am so homesick its not funny @Gee Pee√ó1 its not a reality show or a tv show....its about personal exp√©riences in how the state was captured bankrupting state agences and SOEs @Rob Nel to live in security as a single women and have autonomy on my finances "I found that even living in a gated community I was not safe Patience @Gee Peex1 most of my friends on this forum has been here since August last year for the testimonies...we all love SA & want to know what happened to put us on this disastrous failed state Im in France...Im a dual EU citizen so it was an easy decision "My wish is that ordinairy citizens loser on the hierarchy blow the whistle "I heard of Dulcie when I was in exile "I was much younger than Dulcie Joining the ANC after fleeing the country was a problem a lot of people were targeted and branded as spies hence a lot of us were rejected even with spotless credentials I am happy that I was not accepted as we heard news of the killings of ANC cadres in Camp Quatro in Angola that was ordered by Zuma who was the head of intelligence there I was in Botswana at the time...there was one refugee transit camp run by the UNHCR near Gaborone (Kagisong)and another in the northern border with Zim called Dukwe @Diss & Dad that was apartheid state propoganda The ANC will implode eventually...the writing is on the wall "They do!! I was in presidential and many other state organis√© meetings and parliament...in hindsight it amounts to talk shops @Diss & Dad we also spent many feels in safe houses "In Botswana we used to pick-up ANC cadres who crossed the border Even though the ANC didnt recognise many if us we still continued with the struggle ans helping our compatriotes "Malema was 11 years told when Tata was released "I extricated myself from the ANC when Zuma came to power  "I do believe that CR is fighting an uphill battle "Diss &Dad üôèMy late husband and I did it for the future of the children of the country It pains me that so many honest people were hounded out during the Zuma years to make way for looters and Gupta acolytes..their lives and livelihoods was destroyed @Diss & Dad I completed the manuscript for my book but my first attempt to have it published was rejected but I may publish it myself @Diss & Dad publishing these days are not so easy...they mostly want sensation that bring in the bottom line If you have Netflix check out two documentaries; One is : The Great Hack and the other is The Family series...you will understand what global political manipulation is all about I am doing it in my free time so I will check @Diss & Dad The Great Hack is about the Cambridge Analytica scandale and The Family is about a US religious sect that influences over 100 governments worldwide of which many in Africa. "The Family has tons of money and buys politiciens including the US govt The Family is the testimony of an ex high ranking member of the 'sect' for lack of a better word @makhosi nobhatyi true From what I gather Jiba wanted the NDPP job so much that she made up rumours and stories against this witness saying he wanted to reinstate charg√©s against Zuma "Jiba's husband Booker Nhantsi who was involved in fraud and had a criminal record was consequently expunged by Zuma
makhosi nobhatyi,We are waiting patiently for it @ Magda Seguin No more laughs at Zuma now we got him "Zuma was staying at Mahlamba Ndlovu Gupta pressurized Zuma to rid of you Nowonder how Zuma will respond to this üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇüòÉüòÉüòÉ I can‚Äôt wait üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ @ Ntembeko Mabuya but if he cannot answer this time we will connect the dots "@ Magda Seguin it is long overdue saying CR must wake up and try to fight @ ntembeko mabuya he think he will dodge the lawsuit as he used before surely no forest to hide himself now @ Diss & Dad I fully agreed with you Radebe must come to account "This won‚Äôt happen "No stellenbosch mafia running the country "Don‚Äôt be fooled by those whom persuaded another agenda we can hate these people as if they are the one who make these decisions

What problems does he have 17MILLION RANDS LATER ... NIKS HE don't know "I would really like to know when they sit down to talk ""business"" how do they speak .... do they sound DOM like this ?"
