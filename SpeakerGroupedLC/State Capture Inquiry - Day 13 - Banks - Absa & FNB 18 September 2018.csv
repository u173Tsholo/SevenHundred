Ndumiso Mhlaba,FNB legal rep doesn't look like he came prepared. @Fils de l'homme she even has racists mesmerized 😂😂 "@Fils de l'homme yes i am Zondo J. is the hardest working justice in the country @Fils de l'homme which institution did you graduate from? "@Fils de l'homme that's very impressed "I want to help you too actually @Fils de l'homme violent? cite the research 🤣🤣🤣 It's evident that FNB didn't apply due process in the cancellation of the accounts. "@Kercy Pillay but for the sake of transparency You can't base your cancellation on media reports but the cancellation was an admin matter @Kercy Pillay "i hope this revelations trickle down to the electorate in next year's general elections her name? does anyone know her name? @Kercy Pillay after reading my Admin law notes i am forced to disagree with you with regard to whether the cancellation falls under Section 33 of the Constitution or not @Kercy Pillay i would suggest that you read Hoexter to get a better understanding of the nature of administrative matters. 🤣🤣🤣 The Competition Commission must tackle the oligopolies in the banking sector.

Samantha Trish MAHARI Madamombe,Eta
nhlayisi owen magayisa,Zupta should come and testify... Anc again... Mr B representing Fnb is little bit emotional when they probe him further..
Nelson Musoliwa,No view of any kind from any interest group in a state can be of reputational risk on any bank whether racist or far left as long as it is legal Legal compliance far outweigh public opinion for any business entity to conduct its operations. Is it untoward for the ruling party to engage company involve in massive retrenchment at the party head office? This guy is indeed bit arrogant maybe it is his way but he seems too conceited
Paul molane,So zondo legalised dagga people dnt respond to fils this person is mad ufils masimba omtu lol

Kercy Pillay,what due process . the guptas together with zuma wa looting the country no they dont it is the terms of the contract they have to comply with legislation so no due process well we have to nadmit and take cognisancde o the fact that there was evidence but zuma had effectively blocked all institutions from investigating mzi keep your masander in yor pants this was not an administrative matter hence paja does not apply ndumiso it was not for the purposes of paja i think that was made clear yesterday the bank has to comply with the banking act are we now sympathising with guptas she is married sori guys
Ewald Kruger,"@Ndumiso Mhlaba the guy from Standard Bank was most impressive Pretty counsel is wasting time asking questions to which the answers were already given....
Mziwamadoda ntloya,"tjo uyababa losisi evidence leader/interrogator...she's destructing me with her beauty No! are you serious @Pillay? phofu i trust my muti...There's something called divorce🤓

Leb M,Lol I'll move back to S.A just for her loool nah I'm in England "@fils de l'homme I'm living in Brighton - 2 hours south of London "@fils de l'homme the brexit business is a joke @fils de l'homme no even though there probably should be... If they do another I'm certain it would reverse @fils de l'homme the economy should be fine but it is likely to fall hard if they aren't able to negotiate a full deal with E.U when leave is initiated in March 2019 because they can't negotiate new ... deals until they have left E.U am together **all together "@fils de l'homme the U.K people invented racism and are cousins of the most racist people (U.S and Australia). However mostly people here are low key scared of black people @Wilson I'm dead serious they fear us😂😂 even the police run from 17 year olds "as in the same way as all racists... not because we're violent but because they think we are and expect us to be That's not the issue at all blacks and asians are the best students here in the I.K U.K There's no argument - i wasn't even talking to you - you know you can't skip my convo with Fils "@thando let me shut then sir
