Uncle E.S,"This is a CAT 🐈 & Mouse 🐀 game of thrones of corruption. It doesn't matter of race Nothing will happen.

The guys behind the scenes. ANC maffias "if I'm not mistaken 500 billion zar was given for the sake of Lockdown COVID 19. to different departments such as labor dept "They brought former president JZ to the commission of inquiry nothing happened. He is free "Guys let's be honest with each other here @Thulani people in the government stole the funds. @Thulani this 500 billion zar was issued by President Ramaphosa the current regime. The problem with the current President is that himself is a capitalist minds about money only nothing much
