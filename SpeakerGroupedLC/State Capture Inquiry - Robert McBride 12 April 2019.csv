makhosi nobhatyi,Where is people "Kaklego Person PP has no case to charge Gordhan you would be surprised this is a fight back Eff is using wrong attempts to attack Gordhan I am not saying if there is a case they canâ€™t do it but look at this as squabble "Malema always criticize Anc and even going beyond with ANC affairs saying Ramaphosa wonâ€™t finish his term once he started to chase people who did wrong "Malema still angry for ANC I donâ€™t get you guys however we may be different from views but that doesnâ€™t give anyone a space to attack someone whose not black by color because she or he has point out problem "@ Robert Russell exactly what the man did "All these parties have interest what is happening with ANC and talk about it  "I think Anc understand people better and they respond "Welton paulse I understand frustration you have Ramaphosa is trying to fix administration system by hearing what really happened how deep it is You may fix it McBride was been attack by those whom close to the man "Ramaphosa doesnâ€™t need any Zuma help right now "Mzalwana mzala I donâ€™t worry about whom call who what We may come back to ask what happened beyond 1994 Elson Elson if that happens they must know that country will stand still and kick them all out If Anc can fire Ramaphosa I can assure you alliance splits and Ramaphosa becomes president to SACP and cosatu merge "Zuma faction wonâ€™t win hearts of South African they know that "@Elson Elson I think we have a break down in secretary as party Musa Bakiti lol he must join another party and see if he can win Do you know Ramaphosa was our secretary before his deputy was Zuma "Donâ€™t worry Zuma will be arrested at the end "Batohi is working very hard Ramaphosa will win "@Quinton Jacobs DD Mabuza wonâ€™t do that
Magda Seguin,Waiting Gauteng burning protests and total shutdowns Nothing this side At last thank you Poignant statement! The Zuma captured did all in their power to get rid of McBride CR promised a million houses in Alex yesterday yet there is NO space @makhosi ANC never did anything in Alex for 24 years and yesterday CR had the gall to talk about sewerage flowing in he streets...the ANC must do serious introspection I know gentleman but The way the ANC are taking South Africans for idiots is off the charts @welton that was a definitive apartheid strategy to keep people enslaved @Be @Ndim your words are so significant in the context.Are you a writer? @Robert ðŸ˜… Imagine here state capture succeeding in putting honest people in jail @welton it is still happening as we speak Every "Everybody should read the Daily Maverick investigative article The IPID Papers @welton many do not understand what happens in rural areas and farms..The reclusive nature lends itself to abuse by farmers.Farmworkers are the most marginalised in SA "@Clark Kent you are overreacting Having a rotten government don't reflect on the people...SA is an amazing country with the most hospitable people.Come to France or the UK and experience the stony faced individuals on a daily basis The foreign election observers already arrived a few days ago...wonder what they make of the current situation I am cutting off all people electioneering on this thread @Chris Welensky who is crying? You obviously don't know anything what this commission is about Why do you say he is crying...it's derogatory..he has the courage to talk truth to power unlike the looters It is exactly this kind of discourse that prevent people from coming forward to testify.Whistleblowers must be respected as they get death threats.A bit of respect please @Mathew Red Ants are ANC incapacity to govern with integrity You are obviously overlooking the evil deeds of apartheid...listen and learn.BTW O am NPT your 'auntie' Robert McBride is a freedom fighter the ANC started an armed struggle due to to the systemic and deliberate killing of our people It is people like you who conjure up memories we would rather not think about "Your Apartheid government was murderers There are people not knowing where their children's bodies are buried thanks to your beloved apartheid regind6 *regime Blocked the racist How are we going to get of racist apartheid apologists in South Africa.Forgiving them didn't work. Werksman is a leh Werksmans is a legal firm of attorneys in Sandton Zuma had lots of help from his proponents at Polokwane including Malema and the ANCWL And all the other Zuma appointees? If Mc Brides appt was not apt then ALL the SOE state capture was not fit Thank Mr Pretorious your line of leading was making me nervous that you are partial "@These we all know apartheid history...tell us a bit about Vlakplaas Apartheid trolls here today...blocking them.I really do t know why they are interested @makhosi correct @Eben only when people start to learn about the apartheid history will they understand.Thank you for your insight. @Even McBrides books are very informative too Zuma faction always use 'spying for the imperialists' to get rid of someone or maybe they have something else to smear CR with @Peter pott a day after CR spoke to the farners they had a by-election in Stellenbosch and they voted 99% DA @Eslon there is a viral video where CR tells those around him that Ace is his boss pointing to him @Cerebis it was some on the thread calling McBride a murderer...Apartheid apologists No electioneering please @Siyela Mkhakabele everyone votes according to their own information.You will not convince me to vote EFF The Steinhoff papers are in the pipeline..it is a fallacy that Steinhoff is being overlooked Markus Boosts WILL be prosecuted...remember Steinhoff investments was in foreign countries too The Commission has powers to subpoena Deadlines were not adhered to before by many others I am very disappointed with CR He is towing the line with the others in the NEC...he warmly hugged Zuma (who came late) at the political school launch yesterday "Zuma should present himself to go to jail or keep quiet Cry the beloved country "NPA and State Security was completely captured I read that he was there too True Eslon do you mean Thabo Mbeki? "@Peter pott I agree They are surprised only when provinces need to back put under administration ages the AG reports

Robert Russell,Malenema will use anything to create a diversion of the VBS scandal hanging over the EFF's head "I said ""scandal"" this is by way of investigative journos reporting...

Ramaliar at hi best again.. @Magda Seguin If Ace gets involved in the Alex housing project... there will only be 900k houses built cause he will take his 10% as per usual..... Yes but they could never grow them to their ultimate potential because of the limiting BEE bullshit @Kapn Krunch agreed.... but still being white you could not get any Gov business Namibia has kicked BEE to touch cause it does not work It's friday he has started smoking already The whites have always been here if you open your eyes...

Ndim Mavuks,"Deep respect for people like McBride for the sacrifices including death row experiences in the course of a struggle against an evil system correctly described by the world ""a sin against humanity""" "Being persecuted by a minority It is because of people like McBride that we will continue to vote ANC "Then Derek you did not listen to his opening statement when he said: ""I was and is a disciplined and loyal member of the ANC""" "Derek Hannekom It is cadres of the ANC that fought against corruption with the state at great personal cost to themselves and their families "No amount of insults will persuade the majority against voting for the ANC so late in the day "The elections are really to determine the opposition Kapn you can start packing for the 9 May exit Derek calling us idiots just makes us more determined to renew the mandate of the ANC "He might be "EFF The DA will be punished for having dealt with a stalwart of the liberation struggle Patricia De Lille "The ANC resolved to establish the Commission based on the PP's report Chris convicted by an apartheid state you can't be serious. Derek you seem to have a problem reading please ANC Resolutions "Read Chris "I concede Derek "Eslon McBride is more than competent if you carefully follow his testimony at this commission instead of allowing the yeast of the Bar incident to bubble to the surface He is not clean by whose standards? "Mzala Remember it was racist minority state that sentenced him to hang for daring to challenge the might of whiteness He is not ashamed for his contribution to the struggle "Kirk ""He has turned a new leave"" sounds so white and racist" "Goosen ""Their own people"" are your South African Elders """Their own people"" what does that mean peter pls address yourself to Goosen rather than mzala" The Ramaphosa ANC will emerge stronger with 2/3 majority and deal decisively with corruption after the elections I know that the ANC will be stronger and emboldened to deal more decisively with corruption after the elections A vote for any other other part other than ANC is not a vote to govern but to be in opposition and so shall it be "Ryan Try me "Refer me to any resolution Sho! Musa Your whole argument has fallen flat given the question you posed. There are processes to deal with individuals "There is no basis to assert and rationally come to the conclusion that ""the entire ANC"" is corrupt" "I guess any thinking South African can sustain the argument that ""the entire ANC is corrupt""" That is the likes of Derek them Michael Cyril will emerge stronger after leading the ANC to a 2/3 majority so any talk about recall is misguided speculation Eslon pls!! Even Coke is attempting to get right the pronunciation of the names of Africans
Dianne Quinn,@musa Cheers to that.
Dilip Badal,@Robert Russell ..not a truer word said @welton paulse .. i doubt your allegations .. as we have organisations that oversees workers wage etc.. why was it not reported @Myka'Al Daud .. THATS BECAUSE THEY MOST COMPETENT... PERIOD
Kapn Krunch,dont blame other people because of your own stupidity back then not going to school was considered patriotic no pills for stupid "that's where the saying comes from ""we did not struggle to be poor""" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ cant spell cancer without the ANC the DA are liberals we still vote for them because even liberals are better then cancer sparrow the difference is competence if the ANC wins I for one will be out of here you know why whites became so successful it's because they opened their own businesses after getting laid off they didnt just cry about not being able to get a job but they still did far better then working for some corporation it's a lack of victim mentality mentality is what we need to fix in construction they will hire a white guy because the market feel more secure with a white guy on site it may be racist but it's the market which in essence is the society as a whole blacks need to love their fellow blacks it's like a security guard will beat my black friend but wont lay a finger on me because he knows I will create repercussions but he assumes my black friend wont because hes black even though the security guard is black himself do you see the source of this is mentality and we as whites cant fix it for you this government is about populism they regurgitate what the crowd wants to hear they are not men like madiba who would tell a crowd what they needed to hear and that's the big difference between a leader and a con was madiba a terrorist yes he most definitely was that or his jail time isn't what made him great what made him great was his sentiments by blowing up busses full of civilians to further your cause creating terror to further your ideology is terrorism do you know what Jacob Zuma did to Africans in the ABC detention centres in nourthern africa ANC* do you know majority of the mass killings that lead to your freedom was committed against black people watch a documentary here on YouTube called tainted heroes it's very long but enlightening as to how the ANC came to power and why they are communists Rhamaphosa is being populist at this point they are so exposed there is no other way then to tell people what they want to hear "ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ you must be right ""comrade"" not communist at all" Zuma was elected as president shortly after a rape case that's pretty much all you need to know about him and the ones that elected him as president in the anc the same white racist courts that prosecute ransoms for social media posts but do nothing when genocidal calls are aired on the news some fantasy you need to live in to create such garbage criticisms
Derek Main,@Ndim Mavuks McBride probably doesn't vote for the ANC anymore. @Musa Bakiti Yes - I know McBride's history well. But he must be very disillusioned with what the ANC has become and the fact that he has an ANC target on his back. "@Musa Bakiti After all @Ndim Mavuks Why? You'd have to be a fool to vote ANC after hearing about all their corruption. That's idiotic. @Musa Bakiti It seems you are fooled easily. No - I'm done with the ANC - I've seen the light. They are a bunch of self-enriching criminals. @Ndim Mavuks You must be living in your own reality. The ANC is synonymous with corruption. From national govt all the way to ward level - all corrupted by the ANC. @Ndim Mavuks Then they're idiots too. Like the service delivery protesters - they'll vote for the very same govt that has failed with service delivery. How stupid is that? @Musa Bakiti Nope - I still have at least two brain cells to rub together. @Musa Bakiti No - Afrikaners come in all shapes and colours. @Matthew Adams That's definitely something they know a lot about. @Ndim Mavuks That's a lie. The ANC tried everything in their power to stop the commission but Thuli was too clever for them. She made sure it would happen. "@Ndim Mavuks I know the ANC are now trying to peddle the lie that they established this commission. They believe that if you tell a lie often enough @Musa Bakiti Zuma!?! That gangster! That proves your low intelligence once and for all. @Ndim Mavuks Be honest - the ANC was dragged kicking and screaming to set up the commission. They tried everything to stop it. @Musa Bakiti Neither - they're both bad eggs. @Ndim Mavuks You can't be persuaded - you treat political parties like football teams - blind loyalty. We can't make you think - you've got to do that yourself. @Ndim Mavuks OK - explain to me how you don't think the ANC is corrupt to the core. @Ndim Mavuks I don't refer to individuals because I think the entire ANC is corrupt. They have corrupted all levels of govt - from national to wards. @Ndim Mavuks It doesn't have to be policy for it to happen - just lack of will to stop it. @Ndim Mavuks Take your blinkers off. Any thinking SAfn can see it. "@Ndim Mavuks If I were to list all the corrupt ANC members @Ndim Mavuks Yes - I'm sure they could - if they are not blind. @Sthakathi Khumalo Correct - more and more SAfns are realising this. The ANC is a cabal of criminals.
Nelson Musoliwa,Obvious crime syndicates on car hijack; farm killings cash heist etc mushroomed because crime intelligent regime in SA was highly politicized which led o its dysfunctional status.. Huge volume of cases presented to NPA by SIU with no single prosecution is an indication of defectiveness of the NPA

The DA is an irrevocably right-wing "hur dur can't spell ""intelligent"" without ""gent"" therfore girls are dumb what a profound argument" The reason the commission is doing maximum damage to the ANC is because it is set up to reveal the truth.

Mzalwane Mzala,"Derek hates the ANC @Ndim Mavuks I have been discussing with him for months here. He is not ANC. Sowetanlive reports that the EFF has been found guilty of unfairly treating one of its staff members. EFF is not a friend of workers EFF to pay for unfair dismissal of staffer BY BOITUMELO TSHEHLE - 11 April 2019 - 09:20 The EFF in the North West has been dealt a blow after it was ordered to pay a former junior staff member 11 months salary for unfair dismissal. The CCMA this week found that Maggie Klaas' dismissal was procedurally and substantively unfair. "Klaas "The EFF has been ordered to pay her 11 months salary totalling R102 "In her testimony at the CCMA President Ramaphosa has announced a new board of the SABC regardless of the DA/ EFF objections. The former President of AZAPO Saths Cooper is among those who are appointed. @Thelsa Apartheid is clean because it benefited you Those of us who fought your evil system of apartheid are heroes. Mcbride is a hero @makhosi nobhatyi Let us pause on this Zuma/Ramaphosa thing and deal with these apartheid benefficiaries who call us murderers for fighting apartheid I am angry. They start by saying they are against corruption but they are fighting to protect their apartheid given priviledges. Bloody racists Those who insulted Mcbride for his past started it @Kirk gemmell . Stop them if you are genuine @Antonie Goosen You got jobs that the majority was blocked from accessing based on the colour of their skin. We are fixing your mess You bloody white supremacist "Everyone who wants to be part of rebuilding is indespensable @Cerebis We were listening to Mcbride's testimony until some racist called him a murderer for action he too against apartheid. That is how it started Actions he took against apartheid. I am back to the testimony now. I agree @Ndim Mavuks @Eslon Eslon No president of the ANC was ever removed from that position outside of a properly constituted conference. It did not happen to Mbeki or anyone else. Thousands cheered for Ramaphosa in Alex. He finished his ten years at the helm of the ANC @Eslon Eslon A properly constituted conference did not vote for him to serve a third term @Eslon Eslon @Quintin Jacobs is repeating Malema gossip @Eslon Eslon @peter pott Did he say that or the translation you got could be wrong.
