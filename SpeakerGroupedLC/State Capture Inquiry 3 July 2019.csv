Peet Venter,The chairman is going to ask most of the questions Thank you SABC Digital for failing us once again. Proof of why you're going down. You might as well wipe your nose with that report! I'm surprised that the chair does not place more pressure on her evidence You're wasting your breath Interesting to hear the similarities between isiZulu and my birthland language isiXhosa. Chair will correct the interpretor if need be Zuma is also going to testify in isiZulu @Sipho Hlophe is it perhaps not a case of dialect? Lunch please! I'm hungry!!! Thanks chair. It is KFC for me now
Thembisa Odendaal,@L.P. then they should have selected someone else for Ben Martin's to wipe the smug arrogance but clearly something did not add up @Mhulungisi I like the way you say this 1 it was a polite way to say check yourself He was very happy to steal in English just saying yhoo usile lobhuti

Why didn’t they interview Number 1? Hahaha@Jabu Malinga I can see that coming @makhosi nobhatyi. On 15 to 19 July @Yin Yang Yes 15 to @Yin Yang 16 sorry Hope Koloane will come Hope so @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU. She’s my former DG. I can confidently say so @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU She wants to say her own story.... how she left the department Why are we having two ppl sitting on the witness chair Hayibo... we will have the same from Jacob Zuma when he comes. Yes @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU. On 16th he will ask for a Zulu interpreter Hope @Fello Mkhize you understand how thina maXhosa feel when amaZulu refer to us as iXhosa. EliXhosa... it is soo insulting to us. We take your point and we expect to understand ours. He wants to delay this process How does he communicates with his passengers on board?@postmaster
Nelson Musoliwa,Volume is low mos Tony Gupta told former transport minister Ben MArtin that the Guptas are president Zuma's guests and friends concerning the wedding plane so zuma knew Ja Mr Zwane the Guptas got hold over Zuma Probable he knew they will land at Waterklof or he gave permission thereof or they used his proxy to land there I agree Norman ANC was severely compromised by Zuma's foolishness. "She is confused they wanted to interview zuma even after the ministers have given their statements mos This evidence is defying logic by far; Martins was told by gupta that they are Zuma guests so the no 1 reference is not far fetched What coerced Kolwane and Anderson to facilitate this landing taking into account the fact that Guptas said they are Zuma's guests. Must we believe that Kolwane can violet protocol without Zuma backing; absurd; Kolwane can not do it alone In fact the whole govt of Zuma was invited to this wedding so obviously it knew all about this landing as gupta already indicated that they are Zuma guests It is simple they were instructed to protect Zuma at all cost to save their jobs; This witness is so useless and wasteful
Ibo Thabo,@Thando Nkutha lol i am with you "Clearly we are very weak on everything when using a foreigner language like English "If anyone seriously & honestly look at the manner we think & do things in general why? @carnoth ngomane can you differentiate between speaking a language and living on an adopted language. I am not saying if you speak in a foreigner language you must be a liar @Thando Nkutha it will make your wording laughable as we are currently experience all over "None wise nation in history ever lives in a foreigner language and no nation ever developed via using a foreigner languages @Zeekat like ????

I have to honestly thank the moderator or the responsible of this live feed on the fast reaction to remove these annoying ads. @Dominic Przybylski Today only I did it over 200 times. But yesterday the moderator didn’t react like today "The ANC particularly the NEC & the president who then the president of the country should the model of ethics for everyone """The President’s keeper"" is a fabulous book everyone must read." 😱😱😱 Judge zondo go to the toilet every 15mn 😜😜😜 @Thando Nkutha the language issue?😌😌😌😌😌😌😌 @Thando Nkutha are you here? @Thando Nkutha what you think for the situation surround the translation??? @Lex Luger lol @Derek Main I guess now it’s the right time "Look at the physical appearance of the general @Derek Main not only him but them and i will always do Every African here in SA and on the continent @Derek Main Now you trying to twist my words but must warn you that I am the very wrong person to be play with.

Norman Zwane,"@Nelson Musoliwa I think former Minister Ramathlodi best summed up Zuma's conduct:""He had peddled his executive authority to the Guptas (and also any takers)like a street girl peddles her backside" @Nelson Musoliwa Zuma (the #1) knew everything but like all crooks he was playing smoke and mirrors and the ANC obliged by blaming such on a lowly Ambassador Koloane (he would later be rewarded) Clasicaly this witness has just demonstrated how Zuma kept being protected by an ANC which today wants us to believe it has a capacity to reform itself. Sadly they are doing the same with Cyril. "Clearly they asked a wrong question to get a wrong answer and when they did @Khaya Nomoyi They would not dare in case the whole thing points at JG Zuma. JGZ was untouchable within a corrupt ANC. He still is & is bringing the movement down with him like the biblical SAMSON @Jabu Malinga You need to understand the ANC to understand the very thing you are puzzled by. You 1stly dealing with a criminal corrupt organization which will always protect the DON who gives favours @Jabu Malinga The favours keep the DON in power and the need for favours supplies the DON with protectors who will lay their lives to be the next recipients of the DON's favours. That is the ANC! "@Pastor JJ The ANC was never ready to govern. They ought to have given up to Mass Democratic Movement once independence was achieved "@Khaya Nomoyi Until the DA and others climbed on the bandwagon "It hurts to see people not wanting to take ownership of their lives "@Robert Russell since evryone of substance is a crook in the ANC "@Naledzani Mashau They cannot even be a decent Opposition.

Derek Main,@Ibo Thabo I hear you. How do you propose we resolve that issue? @Fello Mkhize A STRATCOM president Just because JZ didn't have the authority to authorise landing doesn't mean he didn't put pressure on officials. @Ibo Thabo Yes - I agree that's important and necessary. But how do we all communicate? Surely we need to choose a common language in order to do that? @Ibo Thabo I'm not saying that common language has to be English but it has to be one language we must all learn. "@Thando Nkutha I understand that - I'm sure everyone feels more comfortable speaking in a language they know well. In a way @Thando Nkutha It's a valuable skill to learn. @Pastor JJ It seems the intention was always to share out the spoils (however those came about) amongst the top cadres. "@Vukani Mngomezulu That begs the question of why officials would quake in their boots when the Guptas told them : ""This is what #1 wants"". They must have known that the Guptas were tight with Zuma." @Naledzani Mashau Too true - corrupt to the core. @Ibo Thabo I'll second that @Dominic Przybylski The only problem is that they use different user names so you have to keep blocking each new one. @Born free Easy for them to pay that with our money. @Dominic Przybylski Yes - I understand that. Don't understand how that speaks to what I said. @Dominic Przybylski Oh I see. Not sure. @Dominic Przybylski Yes - I was thinking that too. Maybe using IP spoofing so Youtube can't block IP. Her report seems to have been a whitewash in the same way the Seriti Arms Deal commission was. I think the investigation into the Waterkloof landing should be reopened. We haven't got to the truth of it yet. "In fact @Thapelo Motabogi I think he looks quite dapper. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. @Ibo Thabo I don't appreciate the racist undertones. The judge speaks English because SA law states that all judicial processes are to be conducted in English. Not any other reason. @Ibo Thabo We've already been through the debate of why we have to have a common language. I'm not going there again. @Ibo Thabo Scroll back in this chat then. I've said what I have to say on that. @Thando Nkutha I think you meant isiZuru. @carnoth ngomane Yeah - why lie in English when you can lie in your own language. @Thando Nkutha Been through the language debate already today. See above. @carnoth ngomane Exactly @carnoth ngomane Agreed - I said already that SA law allows for interpreters in legal cases and anyone should feel free to use one. @Ibo Thabo You've just promoted him. @Ibo Thabo You've promoted every African to general?

I wish they call Col Henderson after this because Koloane was not lying.He had to take the fall and got promotion for that. Koloane and Anderson could not have taken the risk of allowing the landing of this plane unless there were instructions from above. What about your behaviour of not doing proper investigation.The report did not even suggest dismissal of people involved.There was no rush of the moment pls. The pressure was Zuma.Who are you fooling here. This advocate is so soft with this witness. What about your dissapointing report? Was that all from both judge and adv. He is right to choose his first language and tell the truth and not be confined to English.The judge knows the language.

NEVER!! it was a sham of a report "only 2 people took the fall she was allegedly rewarded for this whitewash report "so all the corrupt people follow protocol did anyone say Major?
Dominic Przybylski,Typical whitewash. Kolwane was rewarded with being made ambassador in Amsterdam. That was his punishment for misrepresentation. @Ibo Thabo anyone can get rid of the spam by clicking on the 3 dots to report it. We can all do it. @Derek Main This spammer is operating throught the live youtube feeds. @Derek Main I'm just wondering why youtube themselves haven't done anything to stop it. @Derek Main the spammer seems to be deliberately trying to annoy people and is doing it everywhere on youtube. Seems to be able to automatically generate new names and use variable IP addresses @Wesley Myburgh CR is missing in action. "So in SA government misrepresentation is classified as name-dropping. There are no such things as lies "@Clive White The Gupta's were honorary ministers of state. They were ""running"" the country after all." JZ will use his lawyer as an interpreter. Zondo will know if there is mistranslation. This man doesn't seem to need an interpreter. "Yebo = Yes Fair comment @Anne M. I assume a lot of ranks are affirmitive action posts. "Leading question - should have been ""What was the request for?""" Why does interpreter translate english into english? @Clive White Maybe he is exceptionally talented. She's better than Buthelezi
Eddy Monnapula Nkadimang,"nonsense DG cover up she is a president keeper
Mahlomola Blou,i m waiting for mr msholozi to come u r right bra yka msholozi must answer all question if water kloof i wander they wil allow him to testifying by his language. kikiki eish
Clive White,This individual is a pathological lair on this event. She has contradicted her own testimony so many times and it is very transparent she has been schooled in her evidence. DCJ Zondo does not beleive her version of the events if you read between the lines of his questions. Like you are saying things and getting away with it. Zuma does not even know what a protocol is. Take him to court "Moyane "Zondo No military airfield will allow a civilian aircraft to land unless they declare an emergency. The airforce were coerced by ministers of state to let the aircraft land. That is worldwide. Some countries will even put vehicles on the runway to ensure they do not land. "Minister of transport trumps Lt Col SAAF "I was in the air force This will be an interesting testimony. His body language gives him away he understand everything which is being asked of him. Sgt Maj to Major in 9 years May It means he was promoted 8 times and officer training in 6 years.. This is becoming a comedy duo act. "No problem with him speaking his language of choice As English isnthe langauge used worldwide in aviation. No support staff.
Born free,Guptas had a quest that defecated on a public area at the wedding.. could it be one if their guests or a Zuma minister?? Probably covering up for a minister since the Guptas have to pay 50K That's an expensive 💩 The Cluster and Zuma are responsible for the Airforce base plane landing. Zuma can only count to Number One "Number One said the Guptas must land there Some Indian fellows can be very convincing and all. Zuma might be hit by a bus before the 15th 😱 Which Air Space is this Major from?? It would seem his rank is Major
Botshelo Nkosi_Made,there is no sound here
Ntokozo Cele,This Zondo is putting word into her mouth @Kevin Allister Simon dont lie here man You can never do a report and leave it for the next PP to impose your findings. Dont lie Still no direct link to Zuma giving instructions
cassim suleman,hi everyone..who is this true but who is witness thks lol..hofmeyr has spoilt Judge Zondo
Ryan Newborn,Who is this woman? Skebenga! Hofmeyr wouldve had this DG for breakfast
Phillip Cwazibe,South Africa had 2 cabinets. One that was based in Cape Town and the other in restaurants. Interpreter is .........I wont say. This man can not speak isiZulu properly. Major Ntshisi can speak English. @Magda Sequin and the interpreter is not a perfect or near perfect isiZulu.
Bongani Ntuli,loool what do you have with the media ? the witness must speak direct to the mic
danie schoeman,These people dont understand the word OATH all liars
Wesley M,"South Africa we need somebody who is not a politician as our president. Cyril is not going to do anything.

Thapelo Mangole,tjo mara
Goose Meile,"the interpreter just said the request came all the way from India
Bernard Matolino,Your Worship? Maj Gen: Bulala Inja; Interperter: Kill the dog @Clive White A sergeant Major must never become a commissioned officer unless he is so distinguished so much that speaking in English in any forum will be cheese @Dominic Przybylski Clearly he is not. Was he promoted for his Zulu proficiency? The interpreter is misrepresenting the witness. Zondo must have known this interpreter to be hopeless Has this inquiry become a farce? Your worship. Your Worship Chairperson @Sthakathi Khumalo Olova😀😀😀😀 Usually as I have already stated🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Raymond Mabilo,mara how come someone hold high position want the interpreter.....haaai maan our tax

Gugulethu Dube,This guy can clearly understans and process English as he must by necessity process official papers and communicate with others officials in English.

BK Light,unelungelo lokukhuluma ulimi lwakho kokukhululeka eSA @ thanks Sanele It fine if noZuma ekhuluma ngesizulu ulimi lwakhe vele
Sipho Hlophe,THE INTERPRETER IS SAYING WRONG THINGS DAT ARE SED IN ZULU AIBO
Terence Nefdt,Speaking in his mother tongue gives him time think about the question. Not a bad strategy. Nice opportunity to learn isizulu. Practice by trying to understand what is said before the interpreter say his piece.
skhomo khura,"its a bit disturbing that all the major tv channels do not cover this inquiry in full or to have a channel dedicated to this given its importance
postmaster,no ways I'm flying with that brother at the wheel!
LYD online tv,HELLO Guys! Is it Adjourned till tomorrow?
Loyiso Pikoli,the interpreter should be replaced with a competent person
