Mike Moja,en nou?
Reinette Raubenheimer,don't think they will live stream Mr x @tikvah thanks
Person of interest,Ms Hofmeyr looking pale today. Needs a holiday. Getting some documentation sorted out in relation to Mr X Certification of translator for Mr X "@Mbuso "Mbuso 👍🏾 me too Anne rolling blackouts while hairdresser halfway "Mbuso Sounded like this witness daughter might have felt threatened and he reported the call to the commission? "Paul we are all victims of the propaganda machine of the global elites
Derek Main,"Going on Myeni's testimony JZ's Foundation is just as corrupt as the Clinton Foundation @Margareth Waterboer Yes - there were rumours that they were/are lovers. Doesn't bring a pretty picture to mind. @Elvis Malakoane Yes - that is the bottleneck at the moment. And the criminals keep on plundering in the meanwhile. @Mbuso Ndlovu You seem to have a real beef with the chair and the commission - care to explain? @Mbuso Ndlovu Of course we are - just trying to understand where you're coming from. Would you be critical no matter what? multi @Diss & Dad I think it should continue indefinitely - until all the criminals are behind bars. Exposes corruption and acts as deterrent. @Diss & Dad I don't think he has yet but I think he should be given one. @Diss & Dad I would like to see a permanent forum where the criminals can be grilled and shamed on national tv. Hopefully that'll put them off. "@Diss & Dad I'm not sure but I put my faith in Zondo. Perhaps the format could be relooked at for a more permanent ""live"" court?" @Diss & Dad I reckon he has assistance to manage it all. I'm sure he sits down after each session and organises the info. A mammoth task but not impossible. "@Diss & Dad If Zondo wasn't managing "@Diss & Dad Thought you said you were East German? What's with the ""our indigenous people""?" @Diss & Dad You never mentioned before that you're east german. You said you were in Germany but not that you originated from there. @Fana Nkosi Spot on. "@Diss & Dad I agree - Malema does raise relevant issues that resonate with a large amount of SAfns. If only he didn't always couch his comments in race politics
Pheladi Lamola,Time management is a serious challenge for this commission Yes Mr X!!💪💪 Judge never misses an opportunity to teach🤣🤣 Majola is coming to the commission. "I'm not sure when but Kate said something to the effect You wasted half an hour after lunch. So go on until 5 please.
Anne M.,They adjourned to sort out a document of the next witness They will be. Some legality that needs to be sorted out before he can start testifying. "@Mbuso Ndlovu No @Moleti Moseki They came back at 2. They've adjourned to sort out some documents. DCJ is making very sure that all the t's are crossed and the i's dotted. Nobody wants anything from the commission to be thrown out of court. I have an enormous amount of respect for Judge Zondo. @Mbuso Ndlovu I am happy to defend Judge Zondo. "@Norma Day Yes @Mbuso Ndlovu I won't be appearing before him because of any charges. "No "@Dominic Przybylski He wants to remain anonymous to the broader community. He knows the Myenis know who he is He's coming clean now @Sthakathi Khumalo And death threats mean they have something to hide and Mr X is telling the truth. "@Sthakathi Khumalo I think the commission already has the facts. If he lies under oath "I@Pastor J Who knows? Although Mr Y could be confusing as the person might think he is being asked ""why""." Looks like it @Sibusiso Mthokozisi Dubazana @Pastor J emotional challenges "@Dopey Tripod It's a commission of inquiry
Gareth Hellyar,What is up now? Why delay? I think swearing in of Mr.X Could this not have been done during lunch break? Mr. X is a sellout. Late start and now another break. Did not state how long adjournment to be. Could be another hour. "Same here And for Kate. "Same applies to you 👍 time management. More then half an hour wasted. Of coarse!! Behind the glass. Dudu knew he was coming here today. Called his daughter last night. Which mamdam? #madam. Judge is bi lingual. Do you know who he is @Dominic Przybylski ? They knew he was coming here today anyway. Remember the Afrikaans interpreter? Stick to the topic @fuzile dazana . True Craft!! Remember when Mandela publicly stated there was not going to be a gravy train and fat cats in the ANC?😂 "@Diss & Dad  Who is Majola? Please lets all stick to the topic. Get with the program. I dont think Terblanch was a government official either. Killing it or killing it? Liken in nailing it? Please stick with the subject @Diss & Dad "Inquiry Hard enough to follow what is going on here without all these other comments coming in. Bye until 9.30am tomorrow.
Eliot Chauke,i thought they wer busy with Mr X Mr X is Gupta🤣🤣🤣 Zondo is chowing our tax... with his delays Mr X is Zulu😁😁 the implicated persons knows who is this Mr X. its pointless fr him to hide his identity
Mohamed Mia,Mayeni gone for a snooze @person. We’ll said Shame everyone wants to kill Mr x acts dumb but he sure knows numbers
Margareth Waterboer,"@Deric Main...and the foundation is bankrupt @Deric Main...mention Dudu Mnyeni and Zumba comes to mind...and vice versa @Derek Main.. 😂😂😂👍🏼 @FieliesSA I’m always nervous with anonymity and a slip that might occur... "@Person of Interest...she worked on this witness over the weekend too.. They work very hard behind the scenes...long hours... We only see them during these sessions "@Fana @Paul Buchel I saw it as a mere joke...WITHOUT disrespect... This is such a beautiful and competent interpreter... "Oh "@Fezile...I do...not hearing it regularly hampers my learning..I even hve files still of my classes when I did isiXhosa Block @Sandlot Squinrts @Pumza And I love her tone of voice too..
Epnet Streaming,Is this only in-camera?
Mbuso Ndlovu,Zondo iz lazy "@Anne M. You are defending Zondo Zondo ate too much during lunch now he feels sleepy😀😁😂😂😁😀 @Anne M. Wait until you appear before him because of corruption charges or state capture Zondo is better than Mogoeng Mogoeng @Gareth Hellyar True What a Hairstyle!!!!!!!!!!!!!😀😁😂😁😀 @Zibuyile Luthuli He is known Zondo is delaying the proceedings again and again😎😎😎😎😎😎 @House MusiQ ZA Hiding somewhere in Dubai😀😁😂 @Derek Main We are entitled to our opinions @Colleen Arezio True He is a corruptionist😀😁😂 He was born corrupt @Sthakathi Khumalo He is a spy @TINYIKO Makondo He is a brother of Mr Y😀😁😂 How much was this money?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? @Fana Nkosi This madala should have ran with this money and dissappear to Dubai 😀😁😂😎 He never said he is innocent like Agrizzi
Moleti Moseki,Are they not suppose to be back by 2pm😢😢Time is against us tle
Colleen Arezio,They sorting the legality out for Mr X taking of the oath. I respect the Commissions work but they need to work on time management. Elvis you hit the nail on the head there. anonymity is out the window now. Dominic you noticed that too this morning?! "Pastor J
Cedric Man Yan,"Hope all these hearings bear fruit ans the assets returned to the treasury. Eskom must get their short-fall from treasury Checkers don't run to the public for bail-outs. Are we restricted from the hearing now? Thanks.
Norma Day,mbuso don't show your igmorance "anne me too
Petro Forsyth,So do i. True. If i were guilty of corruption charges it would be my not judge Zondos.
Lorna Kavanagh,"11 Senior ANC officials on hit list for fraud and corruption .... including Magashule Money laundering..
Abe London,mr x come out pls man
Immanuel,now the hairstyle???? money laundering🤕
Thabani Mkhatshwa,masters in time wasting. they will ask for an extension again true anonymity just ceased 2 exist the culprit for the disclosure of the cc is the Commission itself. Oversight or Incompetence. I leave it to you Mr X an accomplice thru n thru. unless he gets some immunity. he should go down too. change of heart does not equate to innocence Mashobane u so right There is no Honour Amongst Thieves Majola definitely will have to appear. He is heavily implicated. think his attorneys are in there watching n listening Pholoba isgebengu loX Emmanuel X was a willing n profiting participant "think the scenario is :
Buhle Guluva,they were never ready for the x guy
Naledzani Mashau,"The Chickens will be coming home to roost
Zibuyile Luthuli,They are going to recognize the voice and know who is talking. He is scared to show his face to the public and media.
FieliesSA,@Zibuyile Luthuli I was thinking the same 😲 Thats bad... So we know his company and we know he is the owner. There goes the anonymity... @fuzile dazana Yoh man wrong stream. This here is state capture... Start that nonsense somewhere else. Chat is in agreement here @Themba Ntshingila she sounds pretty competent to me. You should have heard the Afrikaans interpreter at Neil Agett inquiry. Now that was horrendous... "@Thabani Mkhatshwa According to him "@Mr Mpho LOL! I heard the pure Zulu speakers look down on ""Gauteng Zulu""" @Luyanda Zulu Nee ek verstaan nie daai nie... 😛
Archie the Afrikaner,They have verified death threats against Mr X
Lungelo Dlaba,and uzumthumela ngezinkabi esa sikhohlakalikazi
Raymond Fitzgerald,the karate kid with that hairstyle especially done for TV
Elvis Malakoane,The problem is that people secrifice and risk their all to reveal corruption but NPA and the HAWKS play no role to assist or arrest just one excuse after the other very bad and painful pastor j Doom
Ziyaadh Mahomed,Miss Interpreter
Yolo More,"Elvis Ai! This madam! the best Anne M. 👍👍 He is. Usihlalo also complained Pastor J

Miro Et Tsumi,biiiiite de noir
Dominic Przybylski,Miss Hofmeyer was almost in tears when she asked for remote testimony. I like interpreters hairstyle. No way Mr X is anonymous anymore. "@Gareth Hellyar No @Gareth Hellyar and those people will make sure everybody else does. I've just seen latest BEE proposal for ICT companies. If they don't give 30% of their company to black owners they can be fined up to R5million or get jail sentence of up to 2 years. Information Communication Technology - ie. software. @Diss & Dad My father came from Poland after 2nd world war and his family home was expropriated without compensation by communist government. I was born in SA. @Diss & Dad It seems that expropriation without compensation runs in my family. "@Diss & Dad There was no apartheid when my father came to SA and yes "@Diss & Dad Yes @Diss & Dad My father was always against racial discrimination and had many altercations with the police about the existing laws. @Diss & Dad Easy to blame people from a distance which allows you to claim shades of grey as black and white. @Diss & Dad Nats were against everybody who was not Afrikaans. It was many years before a non-Afrikaaner was allowed to play rugby as a Springbok. Tommy Bedford was famous for being the 1st. @Diss & Dad That was the impression of most white South Africans who were not Afrikaans. "@Diss & Dad When I was conscripted was the first time I met Afrikaaners and when I confronted them about apaartheid "@Diss & Dad They had never been exposed to an alternative perspective "@Diss & Dad I've been here then and now @Diss & Dad Compare Julius Malema to Eugene Terreblanche. The similarities are striking. @Diss & Dad When did you last visit South Africa? @Diss & Dad Eugene Terreblanche wasn't a government official either. @Diss & Dad both had racial/fascist approaches. @Diss & Dad Both approach the problem from race. I prefer not to base an argument on race because then it is simply a case of reaching a conclusion based on melamin. @Diss & Dad I'm not into identiy politics. I'm an individual. @Diss & Dad We aren't going to get anywhere in this discussion. Let's concentrate on the inquiry.
Paul Buchel,"The interpreter unfortunately walked into the tail rotor of a helicopter last week "@Fana Nkosi​ "@Margareth Waterboer

Sibusiso Mthokozisi Dubazana,"@Thabelo Emmanuel "@Sthakathi khumalo. Well thats what we what the know So there was no cut for him as the medium for moving the money? This guy should turn state witnesses against the perpetrators. After this testimony he and his family are not safe at all It seem the deal was designed for him to be a scapegoat once it went sideways. I think dat why he is singing today

Kevin Simon,This is just simply theft. No pretences. The ARR aircraft parts shakedown was more sophisticated. Why not? Ans. I knew it was wrong.😱 Why Pastor 'J' rather than 'Q'. As in James Bond.
Pastor J.J,I still need an answer to my question. Why is it always MR X and NOT Y or Z? anyone knows?
