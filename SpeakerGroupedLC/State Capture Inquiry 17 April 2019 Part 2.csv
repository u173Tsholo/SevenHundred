Alexander Dowding,I‚Äôm just here for the comments. I don‚Äôt have any problems with that @Felix Muyoba I‚Äôve got to water my weed plants. Be right back "Parliament needs a whole generation of born free MPs to take the places of all these corrupt ... these political dinosaurs go. @Magda Seguin I never specified EFF when I said youth. There are plenty other other honorable and well educated black and other race youth who will make brilliant energetic and inspiring MPs. The brains of the present lot of aged MPs all suffer from a condition called Apartheid Hangover Syndrome. They cannot see the wood for the trees anymore. They must GO. We won‚Äôt make any real progress until they go. It‚Äôs much easier to get a person elected into parliament as an MP than it is to get them out! I‚Äôm voting ZACP üíú üêÆ
S Nompozolo,PART 2 Im ready.... This sounds like a movie @Thando Nkutha THRILLER

Magda Seguin,Commissioner Ngobeni appears to have been fully captured.She allowed Panday to act like the Guptas The commission is far from completed Robert who knows what skeletons will still be exposed.PS:Add Ace to your list Ace has his own personal 'state capture' in the FS Yes but he and Mabuza had their own parallel situations apart from the mother organisation There are so many...yes off course Supra is another situation "South Africa needs cleansing This trauma will haunt us for generations Young like he EFF? from the frying pan into the fire?No thanks Death penalty has been proven to be NOT a deterrent to crime The Sunday Times articles about Gen.Booysen was complete with fake photos CR today again blamed kids being taught under trees on apartheid...I completely lost respect for him Panday is a busy of Zuma *buddy Edward Zuma is Panday's friend too And in business together I hear you Alexander Dowding but first the ANC followers have to be exercised from the ingrained 'struggle' attachment *exorcised I think Zuma' s wife Thobeka is handling his Twitter account...she has the same style of writing on Instagram Not too worry Robert...exorcism has a wider meaning too There you go! Zuma's always chasing millions...so this is why Edward and Panday had a fallout...The truth always come out Just blocked the ANC troll @funicanz...Edward Edward also had a mind that went bankrupt without paying the miners I am blocking them as they pop up Could have been Khubulise Zuma who owned the mine All these trolls are paid Family skeletons @funicanz dry coughing is a sign of fatigue..and stress Panday must be arrested Govender and Patel too Khubulise and his Swazi wife also stays at Nkandla Thobeka has her own jouse in Durban...shd has tons of photos on Instagram *house The ousted wife who supposedly poisoned Zuma stays in Pietermaritzburg Theft and arson General Booysen needs protection Adv Madonsela did an excellent job...she called for a commission Lots of land has already been sold to the Arabs and Chinese...even the Waterfront in CT What is reverse racism? As far as I know racism IS racism...nothing else Not a valid answer There is no such thing as reverse racism Very funny Robert words are invented to suit circumstances Ask any English major about reverse racism they will cringe Yes Robert...White Monopoly Capital was made up for the Gupta/ANC agenda and they were paid royally for it I should stop being a teacher/lecturer They do...in front of Congress @Coder2100 the Mueller docs are being opened for the public today too Traditionally means chiefs in charge? Thank you @rohan barnard I am humbled You are making me blush "The group of people on this forum are amazing human beings @Robert Russell you can ask my LBGTQ friends...I'm not an ogre üòä Please explain to @Matthew Adams why we block some people Melinda I will not call it 'blindsided' but rather 'abused' I am listening nothing escapes me @Matthew Adams but if you say I must shut up I will not He must have wanted proof of the bribe Indisputable evidence @Matthew Adams I think they may monitor us things being as they are...they are aware of our disdain Robert I know the trust is gone We are becoming a nanny state with 17 million grantees and only 8 million formal taxpayers.I know everyone pays VAT and levies but it is not nearly enough "Foreigner investment is very thin on the ground Two bar!!

Robert Russell,Ace is part of the ANC looting cabal... @Magda Seguin and you forgot Supra!!!! No doubt @Michael Wild Throw a net over the top 6 of the ANC and we have sorted out 80% of our corruption problems. The New Zealand parliament is made up of 88% of people aged between 30 and 59..... and a FEMALE Prime Minister aged 38..... Everyone in the private sector who is a crook is a friend of Zuma or one of his kids... eish... the general took arithmetic lessons from Zuma LO< and Zuma should say numbers in morse code hehehehe... You bringing the church into it again Magda.... üòÉ @Derek Main ROFLMAO!!!!!!! and the ANC trolls are going to get worse leading up to the 8th... trust me @Magda Seguin ....exactly true.... Bell Pottenger springs to mind Magda Yes because blacks wanted to create a narrative that suited their own agenda... @Cameron Kim @rohan barnard ....yes her depth of knowledge is very impressive... but imagine being married to her @Magda Seguin .... you would never win a argument... üòÉ üòÉ üòÉ "keeping me on the ""straight"" an narrow would be impossible as I'm part of the LGBT community @rohan barnard" yeah magda... but what will happen with that evidence under a ANC government "I am so angry about where we have found ourselves due to the leadership of the ANC
Wildthing,The large rhino horn find in NW has some smell of Supra we need death penalty back first then some healing and law and order restored. who is Edwards mother The ANC bots are out in full force if anyone doubts this man then they involved in this actions a big skellim he made millions by corruption with police purchasing but Gavin was doing ANCWL work where this guy was on his own. Goosen he is a ANC member
rohan barnard,@Michael Wild death penalty won't work with our current justice system. Innocent people will be killed by the hundreds "I do agree DCJ you need Strepsils your honor I love this blocking game SA Youth TV #blocked Is Toshan Panday also involved with Panday School Portraits from Durban? "@mvubu1234 I can honestly say that between my Indian friends @Magda Seguin I admire you. You have a lot of knowledge. @Robert Russell if one is married to @Magda Seguin it's a blessing!

Derek Main,@Robert Russell Common denominator in all the corruption is the ANC. He sounded stupid enough to be the real JZ @funicanz üòÅ @Thando Nkutha Another dedicated policeman hounded out by the ANC. "@EzaseDurban kzn Media After hearing of all this corruption by the ANC "@EzaseDurban kzn Media If you have nothing to contribute @EzaseDurban kzn Media @SA Youth TV blocked. Done long ago @Eleanor Diplock You can block them yourself if you like. Blocking the ANC trolls is fun. It's like playing that game where you hit the turtles on the head. It's a sad indictment on the SA electorate that they'll protest against bad service delivery and then vote for the self same party that failed at service delivery. Go figure. @Matthew Adams Don't worry - we can educate them. EFF have fascist tendencies. @Thando Nkutha I'm white and I'm also not a racist. @Thando Nkutha Seems like e have a lot of race-baiters here today. Nah - that's it - I'm starting to block whoever I think is a race-baiter. @Thando Nkutha I'm happy to listen to differing views but naked racism is something I steer clear of. Like that @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN Arms dealers and ethical don't fit in the same sentence together. @Cameron Kim It might be legal but it's not ethical. @Cameron Kim Stop shouting dude. @Cameron Kim You want me to defend them? @Cameron Kim You're coming across as hysterical. @Cameron Kim Please explain. @Cameron Kim About what? @Cameron Kim Are you homesick? @Cameron Kim Nastarovia!!! (or whatever you say over there) "@Cameron Kim So basically @Cameron Kim What's your point? @Cameron Kim OK - if you say so @Cameron Kim You speak like you're trying to convince yourself you've made the right move. @Thando Nkutha A Zuma acolyte @makhosi nobhatyi I've heard that one too many times from the ANC. @Thando Nkutha You must be a mafia movie fan üòÉ
