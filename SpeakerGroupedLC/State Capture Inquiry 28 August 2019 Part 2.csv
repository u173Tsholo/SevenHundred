Lucricia Vorster,is it not when u disturb thw asbestos that it becomes detrimental to your health @geepeex1..fully understand that hence my question if the asbestos in a solid form is not hazard why fix something thats not broken... people are just stealing stealingüòÖüòÖüòÇ I understand but why would u go all out to the extend of this amount..was there a health scare was people dying in huge nrs..what warranted this asbestos thing but they had the book yestersay outlined so he is detailing everything and naming now tin fine detail he said he will sue mr dukwana too..here he is sitting with no response from Ace's legal team.. hair is hair man..jeez as if i wont know that SON OF MAN...aka fils se l'homme..this is a witness he is testifying I think the color or texture of his hair is not as concerning Thabo Manyoni....Sandile Msibi(the late)...have experience with these crooks Magda I understand that but that is when the asbestos is disturb like drilling cutting sawing it the dust particles than filtrate your nostrils and throat and eventually end up in your lungs.. "me for one have seen corruption first hand and bore the scars of their ability to ""get rid"" of whistle blowers" and i thank you godfrey...it is still there hence my question why the BIG PROJECT exactly Magda people are still suffering yet we listening here to millions that was supoose to eradicate this hazardous issue.. I am no doctor hey direct your question to our ecpert here Magda I am pretty sure she can extensively lecture u and give proof I dobhowever know of cases where ppl died due to extensive exposure to asbestos at their work environments... geepeex1 this is worrying you hey and it is of use how??? am on he stand....jeeeez i didnt know that...u like to throw stones in bushes you geepee geepeex just wanna anniy us and destract us.... do they even still have that money??? sooo not entertaining u. he must not even trust medication from his GP..These people are mercyless really he did it all the time..it wasn't a special prayer meeting he had a prayer meetig with directors(as reported) he started his work day with a prayer..in any event one should pray daily if u are religious why is the prayer mentioned and not the missing disc on the car he drove... on what basis tho if he does it.. what fb?????? their pensionfunds must be frozen and used as payback its like a ghost haunting me... operation hlasela.. @geepeex atleast we agree on one point

I think Agrizzi will take his own life as Gavin Watson did rather than spend his twilight years in prison. haha white hair He must have been a red head before it turned white üòÇ He looks very distinguished with his white hair. Yes Tebego.. you have spoken the absolute truth üñê The ANC corrupt officials were charging foreigners rent for the houses that were meant to be for the poor. Tebego is right üñê What's happened to Zondo.. he must be on the toilet üòÖ Apologies.. spelling error üò≤ I wish Zuma could speak like this witness YIP.. Wishful thinking I think Watson was on a suicide drive and knew exactly where to crash his car. That's not true Watson had a prayer meeting with his staff before he crashed his car. His staff said it was unusual of Watson to have a prayer meeting with them. Do do I because we will never see justice. Watson wrote off a cheaper car he did not want to crash his BMW.

Edwin Arthur,judge wants a nap
Matthew Moyo,am afraid. lf all this comes out be true it will mean that the divisions btwn the ruling part will multiply simple because Ace must therefore be fired and his supporters will be provoked. the colour of his hair has nothing to do with all his statement. let's listen to what he is saying and use the correct methods to find out if his allegations are true or untrue removing and abolishing abestors roofing is well known fact l don't think that we still have asbestors producing factories in where in country "forgive and forget doesn't work. forgive and remain a aware of the situation that you were once subjected to
