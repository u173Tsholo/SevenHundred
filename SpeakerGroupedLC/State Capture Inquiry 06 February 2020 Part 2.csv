Anne M.,@SABC Digital News Please start streaming "@SABC Digital News Hello @clive oconnell ðŸ˜ƒ Hello @Pastor J AAR was the company that yesterday's witness was involved with AAR wanted the supply contract with SAA Technical @Stronger together This is not the only fishy contract at SAA. Which makes all this graft and corruption all the more atrocious @Stronger together Geography?
clive oconnell,"Not Zuma SAA money already gone on Gupta magic carpet to Dubai @Person No! 20yrs+ behind. Press donâ€™t bother you comrade India cheaper on Teeth and many other ðŸ’°ðŸ’°operations @Dominic Your correct Baht very strong
Sibusiso Hadebe,Corruption at its best I just wonder what will happen at end of this commission "Yooo ESKOM
Person of interest,@clive is medical treatment better in Cuba than here? "I am trying to understand why ministers seek medical treatment outside SA. or do they? is it press Mischief oh OK thanks! This is an interesting witness. gives us a peep into how things work in the industry. did we learn anything from Rwanda? lol we don't have the patience of the Zimbabwean people. but we learned to not trust our mainstream media wuttt???? he's off his meds again "me too "yes boys Franceland? Run if you can. I am from Botswanaland Try Namibia
Mlulami Singapi,There will a huge historical account
Walter Christon Kawara,The chiÃ§kens have come home to roost
Abdul Kader S,Zuma and Cuban cigars any connection?
Dominic Przybylski,Though I'm not so sure now. I was last in Thailand 5 years ago when 1Rand = 3 Thai Bhat. Now can only get 2 Bhat for a Rand. @Person of interest Yup the difference in exchange rate is proportional to the amount of Rands which have disappeared into Dubai. "Some Africans are up and coming eg. Rwanda We too busy trying to learn enough to get 30%. Don't have enough time or energy to learn anything else. We have a government who believe communism is the answer to all our problems. They haven't yet heard about the collapse of the Soviet Union. Zondo so far has spent R350 million. NPA got R1.5 billion. Still not one conviction for corruption. Who/What is AAR? Hi Thanks @Anne M. I missed yesterday. So AAR has no BEE connection? @Kevin seems to be standard procedure in public sector. @Stronger together It seems you underestimate just how big a billion is. "17 million social grants is peanuts compared to what we are giving to pay for ex-presidents' and retired MPs benefits and pension payouts to Molefe types "We will recoup nothing of the stolen money. It is long gone @Sipho The Xing Agreed. Government already owns more than the rest of us combined yet still want more. Cape Town sitting on R18 billion while introducing extra taxes and levies. They have more than they can spend (underspent by R4 billion) last year but they still try to take even more from the citizens. DA are even worse than ANC. @Sipho The Xing What planet are you on? Our government is a communist government. @redriger Join Capitec. @Stronger together I get 9.5% interest on 5 year fixed deposit. British banks give from 0% to .02% interest on balance. @redriger Always had fantastic service from Capitec. Only bank which opened an account faster was one in Thailand. 15 minutes from entering a branch to having a card and drawing from ATM. My first car cost me R450. Bill Gates dropped out of university in 2nd year. Richest man in the world. Degree means nothing if you don't have self-discipline. Don't look for a job. Look for an opportunity. When I started working I told employers I just wanted to work on things that interested me and what they paid me was not important. I almost always got the job. @redriger exactly.
George ashwood yaw owusu,Yes Africans are up and coming we need to come to together as one people
Kevin,"Is BB-BEE not meant to be ""broad based"" ? So its quite cool for 1 person to be the BB-BEE component in a multi million dollar deal and that 1 person gets all the benefits ?" I think JM (local BB component) for AAR who won the tender under dubious circumstances. AAR is an American company I think 1.8 billion contract that does not function....incredible so in short...the local BB component gets 53 million for doing fakkal....just to aid in a corrupt deal and spend the money Imagine if we could recoup just 50 % of all stolen money....We could settle ESCOM and SAA problems and have change left over I spoke to a guy the other day...a very very clever dude.....he says the following Assume SA receives R 10 inntax revenue using the current tax legislation....if we scrap the current tax system and replace it with the following Every bank transaction is taxed 2 % and payed into one government tax account we would generate R25.... no SARS offices required. No paperwork...Everyone pays 2 % irrespective of earnings and spending Redriger it's simple....may paycheck is taxed 2%...I spend my paycheck and taxed 2 %....all controlled by the banks.... Everyone just pays 2 % tax on each bank transaction....no VAT....no paye... I came into some significant capital back in 1990 and bought us dollars and invested overseas. Usd to ZAR was then 2.50.....now its R 14.82 Now Donald Trump is the boss....I will never win I got married in 1990ðŸ˜‚ well said Dom....no true word spoken Discipline...respect and willingness to work

Pastor J.J,"A blessed afternoon to all of you Hello my Dear Friend@Anne M. ...@redriger ...@Michael Wild .....@Immanuel and anyone else I may have missed.
