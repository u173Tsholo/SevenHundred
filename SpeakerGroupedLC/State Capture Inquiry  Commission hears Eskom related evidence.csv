Heather Durr,@Diane Louw Not sure what they are getting at-that is standard wording for a minute/submission. Very often not 100% accurate esp in non essential matters wonder if there have been complaints re Koko and that she is not being handled strongly enought @Naledi Barron 3 December Evening session Mentioned under Koko @Diane Louw Lets see-apart from the heading thee is absolutely nothing wrong with that resolution *there Looking for draft resolutions/submissions Oh a round robin-can take several days to get to each one @Sal SA Happens all the time in corporates save for meetings which require all to be present per Company's Act They can sound a round robin in counterparts i.e. everyone signs one copy and they are then all added together and treated as one document There is a recordal in the resolution itself Cant find a permanent job for a number of reasons so working from home @Sal SA 😂😂😂 @Jacqui Baumgardt Are you on Twitter They need to test her version against what Koko said. That is only fair to him. He is back on Friday. They will then put her answers to him @Jacqui Baumgardt I am on Linked In but I cant even get an interview-its soul destroying @Angelo Doubel keeps minute book vets and prepares legal contracts depending on her level Apologies I cant shut up-the round robin is never signed in a particular order especially when signed in counterparts. Some directors want the most senior person to sign first @les gp Cosec has NO powers to hire-she is not an executive. She is a senior member of staff @les @Diane Louw I am stunned by all these obligations and powers Cosec has @Angelo Doubel A claim for damages depends on many more things than resolutions-it depends on fraud or negligence @Naledi Barron @Cooler Cat Yes they can be as they are two separate functions @Sal SA Exactly-you have a Group/Senior Legal Adviser and Cosec only sits in board meetings to take minutes and not give advice @Angelo Doubel He has overstated the role of Cosec to that of a Board Member @Angelo Doubel I explained it above @Sal SA 100% must she now advise on the law relating to everything and every Act that we have @Angelo Doubel No unless they prove fraud or gross negligence on her part and even then the Board is the responsible party as they sign off on it @Brightwell Kunene @Sal SA Has she agreed-maybe she does reminders and files them-he did not say she drafts them @Brightwell Kunene Did he say she drafts the contracts @Brightwell Kunene I did watch it and I know what he said and she is not implicated @Naledi Barron Yes Seleka has a point he is working towards When Koko comes on Friday Seleka will say. 'Now this is what Miss Daniels said..............What do you say? So approved before agreement signed @Sal SA Correct a rubber stamp Was there a resolution for the conversion of the cash to a guarantee PFMA infringement-shareholder approvement needed *approval @Diane Louw So that was the point To nab Koko and Co COMFORT BREAK DCJ Koko must start preparing for Friday now I am not sure that my client is completely innocent🤔 Oooooooooo Evening Session-when do we see Kate and Myburgh with the ears again @Naledi Barron Did you see that Webinar on 405 last night-30% THIRTY PERCENT of our GDP was looted @Sal SA She outsourced it to Law Firms @Diane Louw Drafting is an acquired skill and only certain lawyers will draft commercial agreements-often outsourced esp if high value and risky. CoSec does not draft Comp Commission takes 3 months and need PFMA Approval. Notarial Bond 3 months to register It is a standard form used throughout the industry-she has overseen many of these-I did at least 10 based on a one line instruction "She Knew DCJ Can I have 30 seconds with my client please-it wont take long I object Chair-Tell my client to stop lying "You saw Koko the arrogant Friday with Koko will be such fun @les gp Not at all consistent with what you said about all the responsibilities of a Cosec Is this Transnet I am waiting patiently to hear the name of the person in South Africa who fixed the Locomotive Contract I need to read that Rogue Unit Judgement. Did it find there was no rogue unit and that any unit was lawful Oh these are the subject of the urgent application tomorrow as the Guptas want to take the kickbacks out on the basis that it is money owed to them @Naledi Barron We have trade and industry deals with them and they supply PPE to us I was just telling @naledi what contracts we have in place When will we find out who was responsible at Transnet for these contracts-Patience is not my forte "@Louis C I do metal goth Evanescence House Music Grunge Kurt Cobain and Heavy Metal i.e Linkin Park "@Lorna Kavanagh Yes @Louis C oh dear-what did you think-I do like Abba "@Louis C 😂😂😂 1976 Mama Mia Yes all of the above @Naledi Barron and PJ altho I did not like her music @Naledi Barron Yes I do -many years ago @Naledi Barron I still love Journey and Steve Perry Live and 'Run to the water' and 'Lightning Crashes' @Naledi Barron I liked the Eagles-but Henley was my absolute Favorite Barry Manilow........................... @Naledi Barron I cant stand Jim Carrey and that type of humour-never saw the movie. The Matrix (I see version 4 is out now) had great music. I like dark movies like Silence of the Lambs @Louis C Eurythmics no..to Annie Lennox? "@Louis C All Cool Has he got nail varnish on @Louis C She is haunting @Louis C Like Amy Winehouse-what a talent @Naledi Barron @Louis C Very distinctive and powerful voice @Naledi Barron Will do. Everyone (I think) knows Amy's song 'My Immortal' . It was a huge hit here and Bring me to Life All that work-I hope they can use it "This is huge Just tell me who authorised the contracts Surely you keep this on a disc-to print out..............again Bollywood Actress LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL ^snorts with laughter if it weren't so ghastly SARB We want to hear this !!!!!!!!!!

M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily,It's up to her to seek an attorney to try protect her from hanging herself with the rope offered by Zondo and Seleke. The perjury that she's committing here will lead to her being arrested for perjury The actress is busy rehearsing during this break - but she's still gonna forget her lines "Lies Let me use this break to eat umdoko wamabele Suzanne Daniels you are going down today Why is Newzroom Afrika not streaming this? @KayOw253 fireworks from Koko on FRIDAY Her agenda is to throw Koko under the heavily loaded truck "Stop the greetings the so-called patriotic whistle-blower will crack and crumble today and on Friday Koko will deliver the final blow to her fabrications She so much hopes to not be asked extremely difficult and self-implicating questions - and she's currently winning. @Ndivhuho Maxwell And Shamila Batohi will help save her skin - she will not go after her - the colour of her skin makes her deserve to not be further investigated There is a financial deal that went wrong between her and her fellow crooks - and now she's paying revenge by trying to come clean in the guise of a patriotic whistle-blower. Wolf in sheep's clothing. @Russia Magezi Yes he (Dali Mpofu) is a brand of celebrity lawyer with a soft and fluffy mind Where is Seleke going with this? He's just wasting time - just cut to the chase Mr Seleke - stop the chit-chat. Dali Mpofu very much knows the law - he must start a law school. He just can't use his knowledge of law to convince judges. "Can we force the court to open the sealed CR17 campaign's bank statements via the constitutional court and the ""promotion of access to information act""?" Romeo Khumalo also corrupt? @Lionel Smith there is party funding and idividual personal funding. CR17 funding is personal/individual funding ​@Lionel Smith Nkosazana Zuma ain't President - but I'm willing to subject her to same scrutiny as Ramaphosa "Talk from your memory - stop referring to your affidavit. She keeps referring to her affidavit so as to stay ""in-script"" for safety against self-implication." She ain't answering with such vibrancy and confidence no more - look at her worried face - and her sarcastic laughter @ZAG Consultants ADV Muzi Sikhakhane's report on rogue unit was not tested/challenged in court @ZAG Consultants When? @ZAG Consultants never lie - provide links to such story Pravin Gordan is special - he does not attend personally at the Inquiry - he is questioned via cameras and screens. Some people have to attend in person @Angelo Doubel a distant grudge against Jamnands Gordhan - the man run a rogue unit to spy on political opponents and also allow friends to perpetrate tax evasion Does Pravin have bodyguards? I want to talk to him using body language. @Angelo Doubel ​ @Ismail Petersen that old granny - sies. @Pastor J.J I'm always calm - for your information If Zuma or Ace goes down - Ramaphosa also goes down - they all participated together in everything. Just Ramaphosa is protected by his White Monopoly Capital masters and media propagandists. To prove how Eskom is addicted to corruption - they hired a tsotsi in their board - Zola Tsotsi. @Kerry van Schalkwyk exactly - he's a puppet who was trained from a young age by his colonizer handlers "@Kerry van Schalkwyk Rupert @MIKE DURBAN Colonizers stole our land and used us a free/cheap labour to build this country @Kerry van Schalkwyk please don't get me started caught in a web of lies @Kerry van Schalkwyk only if you and I were face-to-face I'd engage/indulge you further "Suzie Danielieee @Roza E Side chick Soon she'll start crying - fishing for sympathy. @ZAG Consultants I have clean hands - I use a sanitizaer every 60 seconds Closeness as lovers Scared her reputation has no fuel The script she rehearsed is out of memory now Only if Koko would apply to cross examine you tight as a small condom - they were lovers cheating on their spouses Pillow talk and dates Koko and Suzie If she had a brown skin all of y'all defending her would be villifying her.

She made millions and has offshore accounts Sorry for my insulting utterances Koko will prove himself innocent on the eleventh She is so relieved but she will be watching Koko's testimony on the 11th and preparing another opening speech Don't join the Koko hunt - follow the evidence @Louis C That's my MILF Hlophe is being framed here - open your eyes and ears Hlophe was and is a man of integrity @Naledi Barron I won't excuse the pun @Angelo Doubel I need not indicate my satire and sarcasm @velaphi msimang are you related to Velaphi Mjongeni? @Ismail Petersen Satire and sarcasm @Angelo Doubel Satire and sarcasm need no explanation "Pink noise The state capture inquiry staff failed to capture certain documents - so we're kept waiting like in the morning. The real kingpins of state capture have white/pink/pale skins (no offence with the colours) - The relized early that Radical Eco-Transformation was a threat to their dominance. Nicking it in the bud. NDZ is not President - but she herself never refused to reveal her funders - she did not ask for statements to be sealed. Unlike Ramaphosa @Rahab Takalo A country that would expropriate land without compensation - Ramaphosa will always dodge the issue of land expropriation for his whole ten years of presidecy @Sal SA the PP did not receive a complaint pertinent to NDZ - only pertaining to CR17 by Maimane @Cooler Cat the PP did not receive a complaint pertinent to NDZ - only pertaining to CR17 by Maimane @Sal SA Someone should have alerted her on NDZ "@Naledi Barron Some clothes from China are labelled ""made in Lesotho"" "" made in Zimbabwe etc" @Naledi Barron So for years and years you haven' gained or lost weight to necessitate buying new clothes?

les gp,Suzanne maybe caught up in a lie. She's the Company Secretary. She is essentially the Head legal. She can't say she was instructed to make an irrational submission to the board @Angelo Doubel her role requires that she advises the legal position as regards the company. She cannot make an excuse that she didn't know or understand. "Company Secretaries play a central role in running of a company and the board thereof. They are in the centre of the business. They are the ""keeper of the COmpany's secrets"". She cannot claim not know" "The roles are under s88 of the companies act. Also while you are at it @Angelo Doubel ... I understand this role "They are not typists. Drafting means drafting a LEGAL type position for a board or comms with outsiders. Not drafting like ""my boss may want to have said""..." The board @Angelo Doubel. "@Diane Louw ... Lets say you are a COMpany Secretary.. You can hire "@Diane Louw ""Her job is to correct..."". Remember she has to be entirely there to see for legal issues. You can't type and be thinking about legal risks. It isn't possible." She's pulling one over us. @Heather Durr .. I didn't say she hires.. I made the point that Eskom has the capacity to hire. @Diane Louw Anything off her desk is her responsibility. No-one else's. "@Angelo Doubel I don't see how it can't.. However you must be able to prove that the board did something negligent. So Suzanne is that person who ""advises"" the board on such matters." "@Angelo Doubel She will be left with the sack. Remember that Boards are constituted by multiple disciplines. Entrepreneurs "@Angelo Doubel It's going to be a tough sell for courts to place the blame at ""Dudu Myeni"" if there is a Company Secretary on the Board. They have enormous powers. Even to report boards." "@Angelo Doubel Board members and especially the C.S. is expected to be a strong individual who is empowered to ""Protect"" the board "This lady was clearly a AA candidate... at least thats what she wants us to believe. Like she was a ditzy blond... Unfortunately as a Prescribed office "@Angelo Doubel I don't think anyone will anyway. Perhaps she may @Heather Durr Agreed "@Heather Durr @Angelo Doubel However the C.S. in this case has her goose cooked. She's at the scene of the crime @Heather Durr Explain..hahaha "@Sal SA Per the act @Sal SA.. to know of which laws... Corruption for instance. The use of and meaning of the PFMA in SOE's etc. Those are all legal laws they are expected to at least understand enough to ADVISE @Sal SA ... That makes that role very very legal heavy. It's not a position to be held by someone who is not at the least prepared to learn of the legislation that governs that industry. @Sal SA Can we agree to that? "@Sal SA .. You have to distinguish with whether the role requires legal brain "@Sal SA They don't necessarily have to be legal minded "@Sal SA .. aboard meeting for instance. The C.S may gat an opinion "@Sal SA ""s88"" ""to make the Directors aware of any laws relevant to the company;"" That is legal. And further to that @Sal SA what are the roles and responsibilities of Directors? How does a C.S. fit into that? @Sal SA this role is more legal that it is a BA communications role. Laws are generally read with others for them to make sense. Go to the IOD's website. @Heather Durr still waiting for a response to your allegation comrade..... @Sal SA now imagine typing notes and guiding the board with legal position as affects the company... The PFMA is a tricky act... @Jenny Whitewaves it looks like it doesn't it. Seleka is moving in that direction. "If Suzanne is ""broke"" and ""broken"" hahaahah@Jenny Whitewaves @ZAG Consultants ..Just like THAAT I wonder if they stopped for a minute during all this fraud and corruption to think for a minute... would they have stopped? They were reckless. This lady is thicker than a thief. There's an element of her getting played and there's an element of her willingly thinking about the overseas school fees. She's going down alone. Chairmans line of questioning is out of the realm of hwhat Daniels would be required to ask Koko about. She is C.S. not Business development or even Electricity production. She wouldn't ask. So Koko is at home typing up conditions of play with a potential supplier. Sends them off to her without hiding that it was typed/agreed with said supplier. SO what is the issue here? """ .. I would forwarded to Ms. Daniels"".. Chairman is attaching straw men.... This is a straw man argument from the Chair. Another AA candidate..." Seleka's line is exactly in line with my earlier statement that a Cosec must be prepared to be a majority of one @Heather Durr "If I'm following the entire line of questioning What role do transformation imperatives have to play with the layout of this transaction? Anyone here know? Ithink it was said IFC Were there no transformation imperatives? hahahaah@Sal SA @Lee D. Hendrix therefore Transformation is an imperative no? Was Taggette seen as a transformation imperative? Gupta's aside... Could it have been considered that?
Gugulethu Dube,Miss Daniels was working with Koko and Essa in my opinion she might have had a change of heart unlike Koko @mpitimpiti Koko looked convincing cause he was not properly questioned largely because of the chair. "@mpitimpiti it has so many holes Any one who doubts state capture with so much evidence presented is not ignorant but an collaborator or enabler. There is too much evidence & the involvement Koko and Daniels the question is of degree "@Manelisi that's why I was disappointed with the chair with regard to Koko "@mfundo there is no right not to answer This lady was party of the same team with Koko she is not revealing the whole truth and this will cost her credibility. What the DCJ is doing now is to test the plausibility and also show that an inference can be made that Miss Daniels knew who was Mr Businessman. Mr Chaskalson's hair whitened over these last few weeks Business man/ Salim Essa was probably the busiest man in 2015 in SA

Moonchild,"@M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily - pray tell who his ""White Monopoly Capital"" masters are? So you are saying that he cannot think for himself or take responsibility for his own actions? What an insult." @M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily - WMC is a term coined by Bell Pottinger who were employed by Zuma to deliberatly create division & race hatred. Please specify who his white masters are? @M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily What absolute rubbish. You are insulting a black person just because they are wealthy (from BEE) which is patronising to Ramaphosa. Stop falling for that narrative. @M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily - just think for yourself & don't be led by people who have hidden agendas to brainwash you & control you with nonsense.

Dominic Przybylski,Company secretaries normally have to do board's dirty work. "There was corruption in half of the companies I worked in "@Person of interest Predators always go for the most vulnerable @Brightwell Kunene Very few people are appointed on merit. Usually appointments are made to extend networks. @Dominic Przybylski Often appointments are made to ensure nobody 'rocks the boat'. dang somehow ended up talking to myself! @Brightwell Kunene The people who are usually appointed on merit are those who are temporarily appointed as 'consultants' who do the work their employers are supposed to be able to do. Would like to read Salim Essa's autobiography. Worth watch British parliament debate on Brexit. Shows how incompetent our ministers are by comparison. @Reinette Raubenheimer Would be interesting to find out how a non-executive BEE director became a billionaire.
