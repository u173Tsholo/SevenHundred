"these people were eating money but how much was the saving? he was supposed to be arrested long time ago 78mill400 thousand that money was just sent to regiment but at the end they go and share it among themselves the money is in the personal accounts.. even this hedging thing is it allowed?
Granny Mokwena,they usually have issues with women who knows what they're doing. all these figures for nothing is disheartening guys and apparently there's no money to build school toilets "MNS attorneys did great is Singh and company still in SA though? according to him all is above board?
Margareth Waterboer,The cameraman likes to focus on this lady advocate...ðŸ˜œ Oh my word.. I just saw some of you noticed the same thing...the cameraman's focus.. Alistair... He studied in UK and Wits We are not aware of the REAL educated and talented people are in "Yes One 'positive' thing about this corruption enquiry is that we've discovered what great and educated B My fingers messing up my messages...sorru He's not implicated. They come to give evidence regarding the acquisition of the trains.. Involved with work for MMS attorneys.. The latter invited them into investifation Investigation... I do the same with my glasses... We CAN see near...but need glasses to see far... This is common. Near-sightedness and far-sightedness depend often on form of the eye and other factors... "Yes "Me too "Yes Judge Zondo QUIET... ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜† @lucy. Is this a nervous-breakdown for you? ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Wow!!

welton paulse,jirrrrrrrr seems like Molefe stole money everewhere @Granny Mokwena i conquer with you
Masingita Mzansi,all state funds looters must pay back and serve jail terms for their crimes accordingly
Lorna Kavanagh,The looters stole many billions and that is why SA is in trouble .... They should also be charged with Treason.. yes .... there is enough evidence to start proceedings against Molefe Singh Guptas etc etc etc ... It is MNS attorneys
Cerebis,This is so disheartening and depressing! These guys absolute greedy vile crooks? And now the President has been cornered by the Zupta faction and cannot appoint his own cabinet. Eishh This guy and his company seem to have done a great job in this investigation! "@watson mutanga I agree! The first test is if he has a credible cabinet. No 2 is if he facilitates the action to address all the findings of the State capture "If President CR does not positively act I see KP says he is supporting England 2morrow?
Briony French,"Its time for the people to take back their country from these thieves.... Everyone implicated needs to be arrested those Gupta's must be banned from all countries and sit in prison and no more lavish wedding for them to marry their cousins and deformed babies
Mlungisi Billy,the people of south Africa demand justice
watson mutanga,There have been calls by some to support the president of the country. My view is that he has to earn that support. What he does with the findings of this and other current commissions is key. This is the last chance for South Africa to resurrect itself. "@Cerebis I agree 100%. I am not familiar with his cabinet "@ Lee Hendrix For the benefit of all @Tshepo More: the gentleman or the company he works for arenâ€™t implicated. What are you trying to say? Implicated or Involved? @Thabang Aphane: Itâ€™s certain that the Rand will weaken over time. If you fix prices the seller will lose out in regards to future transactions. The transactions involved are long term.
