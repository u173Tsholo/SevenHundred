LUCKY MAJOVA,banna...he doesnt knw who was deputy??
nokuthula nzuza,documents are not matching dates futhi? to this point... no evidence of capture but suggestions about who should be or shouldn't be a minister....
Mthimunye Maziyane,motlante or he nearly said was duduzane commission its a wake up call mr maseko sound as if his delivering the state of the nation
Njabulo Tsela,this inquiry is just waste of time just like the ones f marikana and life esidimeni cz no one was held responsible
Portia Meyer,This man knows what he is talking
Tebogo Rasekgwalo,i like the manner in which hes placing his facts. maseko seems to be strong and not frightened by the dirty Guptas
Nkosinathi xaba,me sick and tired of all thise inquiry bcoz the do nothing nobody will be arrested after all this its just a weist of money and time mxm
Stevens,@ Nkosinathi. spelling. use isiZulu. akekho ozokulwisa baba "seems honest
Rre Wa Mokone,why is it that SABC Channes gives poorer sound whilst eNCA's sound is so clear...though they are at the same place
she she,"sounds like maseko never met the mighty Guptas face to face

Muzi Ntuli,It is indeed a greate disgrace to hear how our beautiful State has been captured by individuals... very disgraceful
Colanesh Shongwe,Its a whole TEAM against the Guptas.
Santjie Ntuli,I just wonder that what was happening at V Mentor's hotel room
Mzalwane Mzala,Offering people cabinet positions when you are not the president is evidence of state capture
