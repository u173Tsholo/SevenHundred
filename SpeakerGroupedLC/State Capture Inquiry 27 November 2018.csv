Reformation Network SA,He is already complaining. that Maleka was asking difficult questions and Maleka's posturing Sakhile Mbokane you are correct. he is too soft on Manyi.
Danie,He loves his own voice.
lucky Molepo,crying baby he thought he would come and sing alone @Bonani Maphini Manyi was given a chance to sing now is questioning time Manyi put lot of info on the table and need to be questioned Manyi is afraid of Maleka period but Zondo is no playing his part maan @KD Sibisi Zondo is too weak maan Zondo his degenerating this house hahahah Manyi make a u turn drama queen Manyi or break?
Lixa Mlatha,He thinks he's smart Which witness asked to read their staemen without interruption from the evedence leader? "Mr Manyi needs legal assistance
Siyela Mkhabele,I think Mr Manyi feels the heat and he wants to avoid any intervention from Adv.Maleka. Mr Manyi must just answer questions finish and klaar!!! I fully agree with Bronx Wavy 100% But ADv. Maleka was not the evidence leader during Pravin Gordhan's cross-examination... if you put it that way. how can you compare with Gordan? Why does Manyi want to be treated special?? Hands up for Maleka!!! 😴🤓 Maleka will finish you off!!! Why waist our time ???? We are going to be ntashed today...
Bonani Maphini,But they allowed Paraffin to sing alone @lucky Molepo Advocate Maleka is arrogant qha qwaba "Since the StateCaptureInquiry opened its doors only one person that has come up with evidence to back his testimony is MzwaneleManyi  "and they were never questioned Exactly Skhumbuzo "Maleka is just here to defend some people not get the truth Thats what happens when you decide to take sides you cant digest the truth...I am not impressed with Maleka well done Manyi. "other people came to the inquiry with Yes i did Donovan Maleka has a negative posture towards Manyi ayizojika lonto....He is captured The treatment given to Manyi is completely different from that given to Gordhan. Well done Manyi for pointing that out..... maleka must recuse himself. The law vs Politics taking 20 minutes to ask just one question "Mnxm look at this guy "Lol forget Sophia Sibajongile Thato "No one was telling Gordhan to provide a yes or no answer when he was giving a lecture here "My problem is Inconsistency The next thing Maleka is telling us about his Law Career...agg I am not Manyi's fan or what bcz at the end of the day we all want the truth to come out but It's unprofessional Maleka to demonstrate a behavior as he does.... This is a commission. "@ eLSON "We are back LOL "Government venues not suitable for this inquiry selective heat Maleka went very deep in Private school private school vs public school waa haaa haa haaa Yohh i get very irritated when this guys pulls his western English accent yohh bawo
Thato M,Which other witness was cross examined in the manner manyi is? Does an Inquiry mean cross exam has to follow a prosecutorial / NPA approach? @KD Sibisi you are lying! "@KD Sibisi which terms of reference are you referring to? Because all those terms are binding to all some people argue like this is a court of law but an Inquiry "Every other witness has been treated with kid gloves "@KD Sibisi not in this manner "You may or may not agree with Manyi Valid concerns Manyi is raising & will put the Commission in the spotlight @Chela Brake what are you on about? "@Donovan Peters billions @Donovan Peters you are dreaming. Argue better It is acceptable to raise procedural fairness especially in an Inquiry @Donovan Peters who is Jimmy? "Maleka took sides "Manyi is correct *isn't Gounds for procedural fairness Grounds for procedural fairness. @Donovan Peters that is your view and you are entitled to it. Without substanting you are just wasting your data "Maleka represents vested interests judge Zondo is treading carefully becuase he realises this may be deemed critical later. An accused person has rights. Some here are talking about sissies 😀😀 Recuse yourself Maleka - let others ask the questions. You are biased towards Manyi. No other witness has been treated this way "@Bronx Wavy what about Ivan Pillay who headed SARS without Matric "Zondo stance is correct This Maleka fellow and his fake twang is over rated! "This is not a court Maleka is hurt 😀😀😀 Manyi!! Manyi! Beautfiful arguments. This is the same attitude I see at the Nugent Commission by the way @Donovan Peters you don't care but the Deputy Chief Justice is and therefore standing the matter down because of its seriousness. It matters little what you think. Substance over emotions "@Tshepo Mahlangu impartiality "People are losing trust in the Deputy Chief Justice "Heads up to Manyi Manyi doesn't have legal representative He is alone. taking Maleka and the entire legal team to legal school again "Even if they decide Maleka must agree "Even id they decide Maleka should continue A lay man is supposed to be able to make presentations without legal representative. Maleka is arguing from a legal stand not taking the entirety of the Commissions work into considerations "I generally have no issues with Maleka @Donovan Peters why are your forefathers refusing to give up land they stole? "Bottomline: Manyi remains the only witness to have gone under such intense cross exam. Whatever the obesrvations @Donovan Peters it is a free country. I go wherever my mind leads. "@Donovan Peters I am not going to decipher your lang. Suddenly you speak your mother tongue when you have been conversing in Eng. Speak @Nkosikhona Ginya name two witnesses treated as Manyi was. "@Kaah91 Kaah91 but you are here in a democratic country @Donovan Peters what is a race card? "@Donovan Peters don't side step. Explain the phrase ""race card"" in context of black people? Let me hear your political and black consciousness on the issues. Not fazed by mere words. Substance" "@Bronx Wavy you are captured @Kaah91 Kaah91 who do you think setup the infrastructure? "@Bronx Wavy ke motswana papa @Donovan Peters I said explain. You keep throwinfg phrases you cannot explain. Explain your view. @Chela Brake Thata fela. @Bronx Wavy why don't you guys ask me to exlplain as opposed to assuming? @Tshepo Mahlangu on what exactly kgosi? "@Donovan Peters elaborate @Donovan Peters speak of the race card and racial slurs. I want to deal with that. will get to Manyi later "@Tshepo Mahlangu the commisison has sought a particular approach since inception on cross exam and leading evidence. Enter Jimmy *fair? An Inquiry is Inquisitorial in nature not prosecutorial as Maleka has done to much. You may dislike the man but the rules must be applied consistently @Tshepo Mahlangu @Donovan Peters You can't explain a racial slur and race card but calling me ignorant. @Donovan Peters so much for substantive arguments "@holylady1000 go to church Holy Lady "@Tshepo Mahlangu that's like saying a test for any particular group of people must change on admission of another. Fairness "@Bronx Wavy that is your view. Expand on that bit. What make syou say all these things "Adv Pretorius is here. Gordhan lackey. Remember he gave Adrian Lackey pro bono legal services. Let's hear his response "@Donovan Peters I am waiting to understand the lanbelling you so freely threw on me? If you no longer what to entertain it @Tshepo Mahlangu thank you morena @Donovan Peter because you say so 😀😀 I see "This man Adv Pretorius "I said Remember that Ramaphosa called for the nation to protect Gordhan. Let's hear. DCJ is playing politics. It will not go down well. Explain? Or I see what you mean "In Marikana Commisison people called others all sorts of things DCJ's legal team headed y Pretorius is misleading DCT @Tshepo Mahlangu most definitely. Evident in all their posture. Remember who Adv Pretorius left Gordhan to his vices during his testimony revealing a clear bias which today is conveniently forgotten? "Gordhan was left to read us poems @Tshepo Mahlangu which matter was brought before DCJ? Gordan read us poems. Will never forget that. "@Tshepo Mahlangu I see. Yes I would be surprised if the EFF takes this lying down. Also remember what Mogoeng Mogoeng said over the weekend. DCJ is dabbling in politics. This is a problem. Is it the responsibility of the chair meant to preside over the Commission to do this? DCJ was there a bidding process to acquire the building? As is government process? This is fodder for the EFF. DCJ legal analysts are throwing him under the bus. It can't be. That the commisisons pays millions on rent. It can't be Welcome back Adv Maleka. The beef is there. 2 bulls in a kraal!! "For those interested "I said yest @Tshepo Mahlangu a student of life kgosi "@Tshepo Mahlangu take interest in a variety of matters "Remember how easy the commission was to Vytjie Mentor testimony @thando cezula wena na "@thando cezula go and read Thuli Madonsela Star of Capture report which in part saw the genesis of this commission and Vytjie Mentors role in all this. Please read. If you aren't sure Can somebody please give the DCJ an earbud 😀😀😀 "Manyi Gwede must school the adv on deployees. "Adv Maleka is playing How was Gordhan appointed as a Minister of Finance initially without being a member of the NEC. This adv "@thando cezula I am not in the business of swaying anybody. If you want to engage We are on the role. his will take forever. How can employee have a letter of consent by the employer? He should direct the question to the employer @Andries Moseamedi what was the nature of that R 450million "See How can you ask an employee for a letter of vacancy consent? Weak "There are a number of laws that govern appointments Only one law according Maleka should be valid. Geewhizzz How can all governement appointments follow one law. No this Maleka chap is over rated. Why didn't he ask He is suggesting what applied to Maseko should apply to Manyi. Heeee!!! Wow "In my view "I thought Maleka would deal with the issues Manyi brought "Why deal with evidence in this manner Exactly Manyi Why compare evidence like this. "No ruling has yet been made on any of the inputs "Maleka is a credible lawyer "So according to Maleka @Nkanyiso Mathamba louder!!!!! I like the fact that Manyi has no legal representative & Maleka is battling @Tshepo Mahlangu true. @Mkhululi Bushula absolutely. Maleka seems to have come with predetermined views which Manyi obliterated. "He answered this Is Malema already at the Brooklyn Police Staton? Maleka is busy with a high school comparison of evidence. What a bore! @Mr Jones Parker ok "How do you compare evidence? Why They should've challenged on law and process NOT comparison. Witnessses have rights. People are so misinformed. It is a basic right Ohhhhhhhh Maleka again on Williams... Eish Somebody claimed DCJ is protecting Manyi. Their dislike for Manyi clouds their objectivity. @thando cezula Somebody claimed DCJ is protecting Manyi. Their dislike for Manyi clouds their objectivity. @thando cezula tag me if you want substantive responses. I won't always follow if not tagged "Has Malema started talking @Walter Spatula do you ever stop typing? "@News Update thanks I like the fact that the IFMS scandal by National Treasury hasn't been challenged SCOPA did a brilliant job in that regard. IFMS scandal "Maleka must have a love affair with Williams "@Mkhululi Bushula I did leader "I like how Maleka is given leeway to aks questions and provide context but when Manyi does Maleka is weak. Manyi would know this how @Athmanand Singh Manyi was CEO for? Buying a company is based on valuations. Maleka is now a deal maker based on his understanding of financials. Yahhh "Go there Esp as they relate to financial soundness of a business Noooooooooooooooooooooooo Dayum! How I wished! They dealt with the financials We could've had some clarity on the financial position of TNA & Oakbay. Maleka again on Williams. Iyooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Maleka has by his own admission approved williams inputs as true and correct. Tells you the line of reasoning commissions legal team is already leaning towards. That is aleady clear. @Nkosikhona Ginya both are witnesses. Both could be guilty. On what basis would you be relying on one evidence over another? 😀😀😀😀 "In this country when you make observations which counter the dominant narrative "@Nkosikhona Ginya the question was the basis for comparison. Not procedural process you are now pointig to Maleka is loosing it. This is not on. A break will give him time to recollect with his colleagues and get some pointers What's Maleka on now? Maleka is avoiding a break. There are many departments who contracted without the use of the Telmar system. "Again Maleka issue was comparison. He should argue based on law not on what Williams said. He could've achieved a lot by that. I hope they realise "My question is: what if Ms Williams understanding of the law (procurement "Ms Wiliams could have been wrong for all intents and purposes "@Tshepo Mahlangu but questioninng should follow legal precepts "Thank you Maleka for nothing. He had so many avenues to tackle with Manyi "@Tshepo Mahlangu you are making a similiar mistake to Maleka "@Tshepo Mahlangu I hear you. I am saying the lega reasoning for the commission legal team to place reliance on that evidence is flawed and basis should be laws "By implication "@Tshepo Mahlangu relieance should be on depratmental laws tat govern the department @Tshepo Mahlangu I agree Let me listen to Juju
Dan Bourne Yeshurun,MANYI IS A JOKE can't wait til this kangaroo witness is done Waiting for Manyi to declare lunch break Maleka is no fool. This commission isn't his first rodeo.. he is trained to grill LIARS and paid well to do so @Siyela thank you "why could a witness with none to hide u ppl r nutty. Many I is like the Hlaudi of business.. with a matric manyi* thato... @Bonani because EVERYONE knows jimmy is a corruption player listen to this guy... studied at the Pile Mabe Zizi Kodwa Malusi school for Spin-doctoring I can now see the Zuptas have no reason to fear this commission. smh Zuma can easily run this show Jimmy wants to chair the commission now *Enter Omotoso's lawyer I thought Zondo was firm like Mogoeng!! Jimmy stole the commission. he is invited back Jimmy will help What take bread off your kids table right before slapping your face and you still give him protection maybe manyi was treated different because his ONLY purpose was to discredit ALL that sat before him manyi gives testimony contrary to what was already in affidavits and statements Jimmy is a walking ANN7 Thato is compromised quiet Gupta boy u like to defend their mafia for the record... Pravin stunk up the place too with his over talking. he didn't connect a single dot @thato i don't care about compromised ppl Donovan you must recuse yourself Bonani... Manyi implicated all other witnesses. it takes the commission BACKWARDS.. maleka had to do his job bruh stop being blind to Jimmy testimony. he arrived last week with motives. the evidence leaders can see it and they do their jobs by interrogating funny characters such as manyi just block that Gupta boy... only bloody agents are ignorant to logic were back 😳 Zondo addresses commission about EFF 😂 Michael they should have allowed the MPs to examine the owners are now coming out to defend their the dogs hey Thando okay then... 👋👀 and the other @Thando 👋 sup dawg ey we not cool? Dumisani👋 'sek keith👋 glad all the usual r seeing this lol quiet k it was a looting spree.. people did it because every1 was doing it u still reading him smh Zondo had enough lol @Lesedi I agree 😂 yes Thando lol Malema almost slapped Bathabile for that during sassa inquiry maleka world b flea ✊✊✊ Maleka hates repeating himself NY guys watch the inquiry.. lol bunch of wanna be advocates yapping in yea... 😂😭hindsight analyst focus on the questions 😳 Zondo is meddling interfering with the leaders no one in SA gives Jimmy business other than Gupta. his career and professional image is done like a used condom did Jimmy explain the sms yet anyway?? there's a Brooklyn in South Africa😅😅 why caps😕 😂😭 Reginald Block--> New Update @KD they don't. IMC the only witness to make the commission laugh bingo Maleka calm down Jimmy he is getting there that woman came back and stole the rest the woman thief on cctv has struck again lol its actually a paper with words 😂😂 pay attention. they r playing jimmys game Maleka didn't even want an answer😂😂 just wanted to rattle him @Keith yeah but in the business sector of state capture business capture "Maleka: ""am I correct?"" Manyi: ""no""" the point he is making.. is about INTEREST business is supposed to be competitive the sms??????????? @Desmond sad but true "wow corruption in SA will never die. ppl will always suffer "@yose because you let colonizers in public school raise and educate your kid and you only finally ""discover"" them as teenagers.. don't be a useless racist" Manyi will let the commission kno when to break Zondo interrupts himself also now I officially DISLIKE Zondo gotta respect those intelligent captures eh?! at the detriment of your own Give Maleka a break.. he a clearly working alone today against 2 witnesses at the moment thato I finally agree. he is smart @Desmond hear him now? the 2nd witness lol I forgot this was about state capture😳😭 Zondo we lost confidence man.... ready to chew his own gums chatter box these ppl sitting in the commission are secretly reading comments live under mobile YouTube accounts Gwede is gonna chew his gums KD he didn't intend on disrupting
Mhlanguli Dlodlo,I thought Mr Maleka was cross examining yesterday. Now judge Zondo says the commission does not cross examin. I'm confused. Maleka was cross examining period. Judge Zondo has just made it clear the commission does not cross examine. Maleka must recuse himself. @Lesedi yes he made history by cross examining a witness at a commission. This is not a court. Why didn't Maleka cross examine Ms Mentor when she sat for days to tell us about gold plated taps and self flushing toilets. Clearly Manyi was treated differently and that in itself is wrong. Judge Zondo please remind Maleka that Maseko also left on a verbal arrangement. "So Ms Williams @ Nozipho Thembeka is your Tuesday crush changing Ms Thembeka @Nozipho Thembeka I noticed sis wam lol hayi bo. And then!!1!!! "Wow It's a little offensive when GVT business is characterised as government support when dealing with black business Please folks do not name your children TELMA "@KD Sibisi you are so right and we are so bored Someone gets royalties for this TELMA software and it's written into Treasury and GCIS guidelines. Folks there is always someone milking the system @ Yose Human are you okay. Do you need some help maybe. Konke kuRight?
Chela Brake,"these thief must just answer finish and klaar  @thato m you guys dont care about the millions rand ther manyiat dissapeared und manyi must just answer and stop his games the chair must not allow that the guy manyi is arrogant thato u stupit tswana boy @Thatobillions frm the poor how can mr manyi be right when they stole "take him on mr maleka  the thief is stil wasting time and we waiting to be mantashed manyi is feeling the heat the judge is too soft "@Lesedi u remind me of something  these man Maleka must be our publick protector @thato wena uya hlanya u must go to mental observation maleka is about to tear him off now my future pp the purpose is to sent you to jail basterd
Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi,"Manyi is correct "Adv. Maleka isn't a defence lawyer or prosecutor Questioning in a inquisitorial manner and questioning as if one is interrogating in a bully manner should be condemned... Manyi has been giving answers and his not running away "Maleka thinks he's representing Pravin and his crew "Mzwanele is within his right to raise objections Manyi is correct and should be commended for his bravery what's so difficult with Maleka stepping down and hand over the cross examination to his colleagues? "This Commission is a mockery "Pravin was treated with kid's gloves and even assisted during his memory lapses "Mapholoba "Manyi knows what he's doing "Maleka is out of order😢you can't cross examine a witness on the process that didn't involve him "@Reginald "Ms. Williams evidence isn't tested or cross examined "Williams even got the dates wrong "Nelson "Mzwanele isn't smart

Donovan Peters,Dear Maphini-Myanyi came forward with evidence that evidence must be interrogated. Thato-how would you rather we handle this.Billions were lost and that is your best defence for Jimmy. If I am dreaming why is SA considering a loan from the IMF. "If Jimmy is not lying Thato-Jimmy Manyi. Thato it seems you argue for the sake of being argumentative. "Bravery "As I said yesterday-This not about defending BEE/Township owned businesses Poetry-you must have missed a few classes at school. Would have love to attend your school. jimmy knows he bit off more than he can chew. The like s of Manyi like to muddy the water-Speaking about black business while the Guptas were never even SA born. We don't care even if it is not a court of law we wan't ppl to pay.Thato Substance-What substance have you displayed in this debate? em D​-Witnesses can calle back if need be. Thato-Ppl-speak for yourself. Thato-It must be sad being you. They always say ppl who are loud try to drown out others without any concrete evidence but speculation. Why are the Nomvula's of this world not picking up the Rand? You should not have gone there Kwedini. Uyabona kwedini uyitsale emsileni Ujabonga ifana nawe leyo. Playing the Race card to muddy the water will not work mfana. Sometimes I wonder whether you are being paid for all the viel you sphew. Thato M -whenever you seem to be losing an argument you revert to racial slurs. Manyi was implicated thus the testing of the evidence. Thato M -whenever you seem to be losing an argument you revert to racial slurs.IF you don't understand that you must be pulling a Manyi on me. Thato M-That's why Maleka is asking the questions. Thato -Simply put you can't state a point by not going to a persons race when tested on your ignorant comments. He led his own evidence and is now being tested. Thato -talking to you is like a dog chasing his own tail. Manyi was brave :he was bold wanted to have his say last week-adv Maleka told him they have date set for today and now Manyi cries foul. thato-you are such a sad case. We will wait for Manyi with lawyers and all.
Palesa Leraisa,Manyi is jst taking time this is jst delaying tactics yeses
Nkanyiso Mathamba,Maleka needs to be professional here "Nami Maleka thinks this is a court of law where he is representing a certain faction/side which is obviously in this case Pravin and his lackeys Maleka seems angry that monopoly capital is being exposed as corrupt "Take this Pravin lackey on Cde. Manyi "DCJ Zondo is also taking us for a ride here "State Capture comm is for people who want to implicate Zuma & the Guptas. Anyone saying something different is terrorized. Stand your ground Manyi "ha ha ha ha thatha Manyi thatha Adv. Maleka is nothing but a Pravin lackey The clearly captured Maleka first complained about time izolo yet South Africa gave Pravin the WHOLE 3 days to tell us NOTHING!
Tusani Jwara,"their ""poetry"""
tererai chipango,ecuse himself lol some1 ill advised manyi last night Manyi does not want to accept responsibility in any form whatsoever Manyi likes to elaborate unnecessarily Manyi simple Manyi needs to go find evidence that backs up his statements...lol ..... i doubt if he has any....
Allan 28,I thought the Judge was going to make a special announcement today about the happenings outside the commission have they stolen the cameras again "Cameras gone they stole the signal The woman has struck again "She is back guys "My prayer goes for that Micro phone Rain court for the Microphone please
AGARO WANJE,Manyi is actually questioning the credibility of Judge Zondo. He is just afraid he might incriminate himself because Maleka is no sunday school. Manyi thought recusal is as simple as that. Now he realizes that it is not that easy. you cant question the credibility of a lawyer and not be expected to motivate in writing. "Even if Maleka recuses himself "VIVA MALEKA VIVA ku shushu e'kommission Manyi was advised by his lawyers last night to derail Maleka before it got worse with him. Clever but self destructing move. The next evidence leader will grill him even worse ... Where is EFF here to defend Maleka. The EFF wanted Maleka to be the Leader of the Legal Team leading evidence. Thank you Tshepo those who live in glass house may as well as answer the door bell. Manyi take heed mfowethu. "nobody buys a loss making business unless you are kukus
Derrick Busani,He wants to continue but not with Maleka....
Sthakathi Khumalo,"When we said yesterday Maleka was being unprofessional Otherwise this will crush all his evidence and he wasn’t doing that bad "Manyi flopped here Give another evidence leader and we continue Maleka is just being a bully. Let the other candidate take over! Manyi has bullied him qha Zondo knows Maleka crosses the line. Maleka just stand this one down For the sake of the country. Manyi will be caught eitherway "Public protector in Concourt Maleka should have given another the leader. Because now its nasty!! "Lebi Tsholo Looools Maleka is lost to be honest "Lesedi Ditibane Even Fuzile Operational matters of governance Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi Mind you we are not even on cross examination "Mondli Zuma Exactly Manyi is savage haha cross examination haha "But lets all be fair guys Maleka is all over really Like really Maleka is just weak Tshepo Mahlangu lols izinyo Is this cross examination people or we are still leading evidence for correspondence? Ow Manyi has the legal team in shambles Ehe uyaphapha Malek Williams evidence has not been tested though Dumisani Nxumalo so Manyi is on cross examination kahle kahle Cn we just pull out the regulations of Tema "Bronx Wavy let them read Manyi is charming legal team Malema is live people Ntasharing is here!!
Blaze 613,does he want to walk away from the stand stinking of butterflies? there is no place for sissies in this whole thing... he will get same questions from anyone else...whats the point??
sylvester january,Just like i said yesterday Mr Maleka will be on a Roll Jimmy is in Quagmire Gupta Boy Who does he think he is why does he want to direct the commision Bravery its a joke Maleka is on the right path Thats for sure Lesw Zondo is too soft on this Clown Viva Maleka he crushed Jimmy in the first quarter of evidence He is bringing somebody back who can not talk for himself thats how shellow this bloke is His between sixes and seven Jimmy comes to Town Clown exposed swak spinner Jimmy just make Vincent Maleka a celebrity ADV He is playing deapth now I mean deaf Maleka has not done anything yet if we really understand what is lying ahead this Manyi is finished before the commission has gone anywere with him His not smart and exposes himself as liability to his handlers Manyi must go to Court after court straight to jail cause this Dude is one of the people who anhanced the extend of state capture

Marvel Ramatshela,Manyi is making this thing a mockery. But I still think Justice Zondo is a wrong person for this commission "I repeat "He's looking for pity gestures money is being wasted for nonsensical delaying tactics hence they even steal cameras in this room. People do as they wish He's being arrogant This ain't working. "Adv Maleka is being bullied Judge Zondo is not mediating this commission properly. hence Mr Manyi is being defensive workshop.. They kept quiet when the Indian boys were chowing our money for nothing. now they act surprised but also benefited!

Trucker Trucker,Maleka is bias and everyone can see that he is pushing a certain agenda. Maleka lacks professionalism and impartiality. You could see Maleka threading carefully against Gordhan.
Tebogo Leeuw,"Jimmy thought he would move on red carpet Be careful Manyi for what you're asking for. What may come way may be more than what you're facing.
Duma Ngcobo,Manyi is trying to cast aspersions on the commission because he is effectively alleging that the chairperson is unable to take control of proceedings were a witness to be treated unfairly. Besides Pravin is still coming back to present evidence as well. Manyi was not asked questions the 1st time round as well...
Kuvhanganani Musekwa,Mr Manyi volunteered to be a witness now he's crying foul. If he has all the facts why should Adv Maleka recuse himself

Andre Gerber,Manyi did not want Maleka since yesterday. You could see he ignored him yesterday
Job Mokolutlo,Manyi is just a chancer who is bitter that the GUPTA looting has been exposed to his detriment! "To us the broad public "Adv Maleka is a tried and tested legal guru and so by the time he finishes with Manyi Manyi seems to have jumped the gun by critising Ms William even before the latter had finished testifying! it`s strange that Zondo would protect Manyi rather than reprimand him for sending Ms Williams an sms right in the middle of her testimony Where is the ANCYL militancy to counter the EFF VBS looters who are hellbent in insulting ANC leadership? What Manyi doesn`t realise is that Adv Maleka is trying to convince the inquiry about Manyi being the enabler of state capture via his Gupta connections "Manyi is aware that he is being exposed as the Gupta stooge Maleka is trying to show that for Manyi to buy a loss-making entity from the Guptas was solely for money-laundaring and was not just an innocent business decision as it seemed!
Singi Mathebula,so advocate pressed a wrong button. this manyi boy is spoiled and arrogant. was he forced to appear before the commission and by whom? waiting our data for nothing. s u have already frustrated the commission and the nation. stupid gupta puppet i never thought manyi is this stupid. 😱😱 hayboo khumalo😎 but he seems to be disowning his own hand writting. strange heeeee!! spot on hilton fire fire fireeeee i think he also talk about pravin in his sleep

Athmanand Singh,Manyi should get his legal team to question those who gave evidence if he thinks they were lying or making up stories.

Zolani Hoza,.. stupid politician .. he's self-destructive .. sooner or later the credibility this mickey mouse evidence will be paralised and exposed ..
Lucky David Joza,true@Lesedi
Tulonga Henoch,@Singi Mathebula it is Manyi own statement THEN Manyi pulled the plug on us
Lebogang Gaorutwe,@Lesedi - This is a mess "He is a cry - when they were given positions and bribes Mr. Maleka's pronunciation of words are quite weird date - - - date - - - - date None of the people questioned are confirming that they made mistakes so the commission can be concluded - they are all passing the bug
Isivuno NPO,Oppenheimer contest that the agreed verbally with Malusi Gigaba but nobody is making noise about it. Maleka thinks English is the value yard stock to measure intelligence.
Sipho Owen Ndhlovu,this guy is just one that should not be taken serious in anything on matters of principle

Sipho Mnyakeni,its the 3rd not the 2nd; Maleka says Give or Take ...no the tHIRD why is MALEKA trying to Defend Pumla Williams testimony ... Why is Manyi supposed to agree with Pumla. let MAnyi testify and all will be tested later Maleka is trying to AMBUSH MAnyi Maleka Must be a lawyer @Desmond Masilela he is here as evidence leader ot representing anyone but he is trying to prove a side wrong Manyi is on Top of His game. What is teh line MAleka is trying to push? Maleka is clutching at Straws All those who came with preconceived ideas will turn against Zondo
sam mukori,Manyi is leadership Maleka is getting hopeless Maleka has been damaged
Linda Dlamini,manyi is confused
Derek Main,@sam mukori Manyi is a Gupta stooge Don't cry Manyi Manyi ducks and dives like a true snake
Mr Jones Parker,This guy is making sure he does not answer.... "@Thato M Exactly @Walter Spatula @News Update and he succeeding @MIKE LOCK and he is patient

"Seems that Manye has put himself in some trouble it would interesting why he choose to show up here in the commission
General Tech Con Gentec,Mechanical is back again? Zondo is not been neutral he is leaning more to Mr Manyi's side....
Mkhululi Bushula,@Thato M I am one of Manyi's critics but I said it yesterday that he is on top of his game I am very impressed with how he managed to get under the skin of Maleka. @Thato M lol withdraw comrade. @Thato M enkosi nkokheli. It's becoming interesting now. Manyi is very clever when he is cornered he runs to the chairperson for cover.
Serepa Le Mabona,Thato! You can't generalise about which testimony is correct or wrong. Some aspects might be correct or incorrect from both sides. Just listen and draw conclusions at the end.
solly Thaba,This Manyi guy likes explaining himself a lot than giving straight answeres when required.😂
Damaking Alie,yes not every process s a yes or No... Zondo for the first time rethinks the legal theory of the Commission.....
Xolani Mabusela,Why he's so defensive? 🤔 There's something fishy here
Gareth Davies,What is that Purple Wristband that Manyi has on his right hand? It appears to me that Zondo is defending Manyi.
nyiko nyiko,manti is loosing it lol. stolen the camera manyi may u pls answers question nd stop acting damm now pls
hilton modike,manyi cornering himself lol mara manyi an atul stooge where was their conscience when he allowed himself 2 b compromises by atul ashu chawla that guy was the ceo of anc and the government 😂😂😂😂 Lol sending cv to tony guptas asking him to recommend people . 😂😂😂😂😂😂

ROYAL FOREX,ae ae ae ae ae zondooooo manyi has a pride ... this cant be tolerated @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU you are right we need more clarity on VBS LOAN @Mondli Zuma he is weak somebody remove zondo from that chair plsssssssss @News Update yeah... tooooo much distraction from weak zondo
Livingstone Mulaudzi,"Manyi which VBS he dismendle This Manyi think he is better that he change change guidelines. guidelines are not decorations Nothing is clear on Manyi's eyes "Manyi is mix street life
Ntokozo Cele,Maleka thinks he is Lumumba
Mandisi Tshabiso,Zondo's education was funded by Indian guy
Nditsheni JOP,Manyi can only fool himself not the public "Maleka must interrogate Zuma
Sphile,jimmy many must just calm down he is dealing with the intelligents this maleka is intelligent and he manages his emotions brilliantly i think Zondo is spoiling the game
