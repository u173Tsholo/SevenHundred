Lorna Kavanagh,These 2 reports have been the topic for three days now ..... me too Felix ... it appears the Judge and the Advocate are not happy about the answers they are getting as it does seems confusing 30 people ! but when will he get to that ? taken 3 days on the 2 reports. i feels as though he is taking the Judge and Advocate down the garden path.... .... i know that i am confused. i have fallen asleep many times ..but why so long to get clarity on the reports. Now why was is it called 'Rendition' ? thank you Magda. .... is The advocate getting to the nitty gritty. Zondo must remain as the Chair person... please someone give us a translation wow Zondo younger brother whois an advocate it will be a travesty if DCJ Zondo is recused... someone give us the. translation come let us hear translation

ofhie Muofhe,steinhoff commission should be next @Felix Muyoba Thats where corruption is being hidden by the media @Magda Seguin no one will report on the doggy work that Werksmans did @carnoth ngomane its a shame to see us believing what the media say as the fact and final truth without proper research @Magda Seguin Why are we not being informed about those millions now. They should payback the money coz they did a bad job Why is ENCA not covering the McBride testimony? @Magda Seguin on what @Magda Seguin your Lawyerish neh ''investigative journalist'' does that mean they write facts and truthful information. coz thats my concern. but to predict a fact is a false assumption of the truth @ Why didnt he put those evidence in front of a judge "@Magda Seguin my problem is when you say people have evidence @Anne M. am referring to evidence from journalist @Anne M. that shows that the NPA was 100% captured But is it a duty of a journalist to label a person as corrupt without any legal stand @Magda Seguin please do @Magda Seguin y am i a troll now I see. @Sthakathi Khumalo Real evidence
Sandile Lugogwana,This is the man I‚Äôve been waiting for üòÇ
Magda Seguin,"Ex Police Minister Nleko did the unthinkable...interfere with the independence of IPID "Werksmans were paid millions ...when Mc Bride went to the parlamentary police committee it ended when McBride Werkmans sent two emails that Mr Pretorious showed this morning trying again to implicate McBride but the content was rebutted by him...they must becreported to the Bar "They conspired to get rid of all three When Cele did not want to extend McBrides contract he wrote a letter to parliament that heaviky implicated McBride that is why they voted incfavour of getting rid of him. @Lorna...for absolute clarity There was never a 'rendition' the constitional court found it false @ofhie...amaghunbane and daily maverick has done lots of investigative work...I th Rendition is a term that describes persons are rendered to another country...McBride and co was accused by the minister to have kidnapped and rendered people wanted by Zimbabwe Everything is in the public domain.Some political parties accuse investigative journalists to be stratcom thereby informing people not to believe the press so that they stay uninformed "I am not a lawyer The Judge has to have ALL the details for his final report and recommendations to the president. @phumudzo just looking at a person and deciding he is a liar?You must be able to read minds.The comments here always amazes me how judgemental South Africans are @ofhie absolute proof and evidence is checked before writing ANY article.It is only fake news that goes under the radar but there is a way to detect fake news instantly Ace says he will sue the author of Gangster State but the author has all the evidence...he has lawyers that checked all the facts so if Ace sues all the proof will come out in court There is NO predictions...ONLY facts as per investigations and whistleblower testimony that is why journalists will never and can never be forced to name their sources @phumudzo...you will get into serious trouble labelling people without evidence Nowhere in the world is it a journalists duty to open cases they are there to provide information in public nterest During Zuma's tenure it is now public knowledge that SAPS was also captured The teacher in me always want to educate but since I dont lecture anymore I should just give it up ofhie is a troll I amazed at the ignorance of some people...especially those that are previously priviledged....those that benefited from apartheid And are still benefiting We live in cyber age...the literate have no excuse to be ignorant of theircenvironment Logic and reason flies out the window when you have populist right wing tendencies And the Basque Catalonia is still part of Spain (inside Spanish borders) "@Cerebis I know Andorre is situated between France and Spain...its a tax haven Yep! I saw on Twitter state capture handle it was Mr Khuba and Mr Seseko on the phone "I typed 'state capture' in the twitter search bar and came across their account "@Madelein most of my reading depends in actual authentic documentation @makhosi the next witness is General Booysen of KZN...he was set up in the so called Cato Manor debacle that the Sunday Times published....all turned out to be false @makhosi ü§£ Judge Zondo's brother chaired McBrides disciplinary before he was suspended..Mr Pretorious read out that he does not want to testify or cross examine McBride "I don't agree @Lorna...if he stays it will be fertile ground for the im0licated to say there is conflict of interest.One has to avoid doubt or suspicion "@Lew464 what gives you the right to label me as a victim.You know nothing about me.Be careful What the heck is 'white exclude'? I am not scared of anyone...least if all white people...my late husband was a white foreigner and I travelled more places than you ever hope to see. Go away with your crass attitude...there are decent people on this forum...you are the typical troll @Lew464 Are you threatened by me? You have a false name and a cartoon for your avatar...that says a lot...what and who are you? I will not refrain from anything...they are allowed to say and insult on a daily basis...I never recoil from these worms I was brought up by educated parents and studied long and hard.Ypu are a disgrace to humanity insulting someone you don't know anonymously...what are you scared of? BLOCKED AND REPORTED This is how white supremacy acts I just want to make it clear...white supremacy and fascism is real...an example is what happened in New Zealand.I smell them a mile away.It has nothing to do with my prejudice but reality @Luvuyo üôè If I was against white people I would have refused to care for soldiers returning from the border 'war We all deserve respect but respect is also earned Some of those soldiers had such bad post traumatic stress syndrome just like the MK soldiers...I scared for anyone in my care irrespective of who they were *cared Who are 'you guy's? and who is pathetic? Careful for generalisations now And blind accusations... @Helen Terry...with respect...I am not a child to be talked down too I will never say anything here that I can't say to your face so please stop being facetious I hate being addressed as if I'm a fool @Greg yes thanks it's going well "@Robert I really have empathy for all the men who went through the trauma ...there was never proper debriefing "@Robert Russell take care @Eslon ....lol
Kgafela Setae,is it just who is tired of this report run around. yoh this is so chilling. Mcbride was to be assassinated
phumudzo magidi,"I've just tuned in now. Mc Bride looks like a lier. I've not heard what he is saying but eeish I don't know. hence my confession of prejudice. pi would make a bad judge. I look at you once and decide if you are a sgebengu or not. I see a tsotsi @Derek Main i see a tsotsi when it comes to that one @Canon I don't even listen to evidence. I just judge from the looks I could spot a thug from a distance at bree street when I was still young. never got mugged all my life because I can see a nafarious person. I'm talking rubbish but Mcbride just looks like mashaya
omar suleman,‚Äã@phumudzo how did you conclude that McBride is a Liar
Sthakathi Khumalo,Where are we vele vele?? Just tuned in and Zondo is posing in many funny lost ways!! Is he talking about his bro now? and conflict of intrest "ofhie Muofhe If people do not want to accept your point of view "I just think Brigadier who... Too much codes here..
Derek Main,@phumudzo magidi Tell us what you see when you look at Ace Magashule. That should show us how accurate your decisions are. @phumudzo magidi Excellent! Seems like your radar is working. @Nelson Musoliwa Should be very simple. @Cerebis What's a Catalonia? I want one. @Cerebis Yes - I've heard about it. Also think they should be free to be self-governed. I don't see Fils' bile - blocked him long ago. @Greg Stewart They're playing a recording of cell conversation.
Anne M.,@ofhie Muofhe Adv Pretorius showed a slide on the 1st day of McBride's testimony;. On it was the number of cases sent to the NPA and the NPA didn't prosecute any. @ofhie Muofhe Okay

Cerebis,Free Catalonia. @Derek Main An Oppressed country by Spain. "Catalonia was an independent region of the Iberian Peninsula ‚Äì modern day Spain and Portugal ‚Äì with its own language "Subsequent kings tried to impose the Spanish language and laws on the region "@Magda Seguin Calm down. Ignore the race baiters! Please can you refrain from what appears to be some issue with ""White people""???" Blocked and reported Magda @Greg Stewart Very True and I agree! But the words used on this forum at times are very similar to what started the Rwandan tragedy. @Madelein Huxtable You are off course wrong in saying that Transvaal comes from Apartheid? The Republic of Transvaal was founded in 1852...a little time before the Sad Apartheid period.

Eslon Eslon,@Fils de I'home.. DCJ Zondo younger brother chaired an inquiry that was set up to victimize Mcbride for doing his job "@Fils de I'home... That's my only concern now bcos there's a potential conflict of interest on the part of the chair @Luvuyo Zantsi... Do not get it twisted. Pretorius raised the issue bcoz Zondo's younger brother was involved in Mcbride's disciplinary hearing. Sesoko never appeared for Pretorius to raise the matter Why is Zondo asking if Mcbride is comfortable with Pretorius's questions? "I didn't follow the whole testimony today The make-up on the young advocate face is distractive
Greg Stewart,money being given by anc to elders - yikes this can only end badly "peace watch how Rwanda reconciled - great lessons to be learned @Cerebis lets encourage respect - we really do not want a repeat - 1994 is very important to south africans and Rwandans but Rwandans have be best economy growth in africa 25 years later phew!! is it going to rain in sub sahara africa tomorrow whats with the dodgy conversation oops sound is picking up mobile phone conversation this call is implicating somebody @Derek Main - thanks derek sesoko mentioned speak love - eirie @Magda Seguin - have you started on biography book yet?
