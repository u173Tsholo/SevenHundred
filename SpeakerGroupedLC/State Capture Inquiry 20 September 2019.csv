Celuthando Celuthando,u not alone they haven't started what is going on🙄 my lady stop twisting the words of colonel 😂 I'm glad zondo saw it coming 🤗 morning@lesego mosaka
Jaytee Morifi,am I late or the is postponement
Derrick saperstein,The said 9:30 today. OOPS! The JUDGE said 9:30 today. "Before 1994 "Rosalind "Rob Nel "Maditla - 4 life sentences! The prison system will give proper punishment. In 1976 I would love to see a proper report on Watson's autopsy.
Epnet Streaming,My judgement is that you can go - have the day off
Maggie Render,I also heard 9.30 none I hope
Keith Hadden,What are the odds of the sound breaking down again? Late again! Maybe the judge is too sick today
Dan Brown,Odds of Sound Problems are 100% judging by the SABC sound operators monitored activity. They never do a day without keeping constant levels. Witnesses do get bumped off. Look at Gavin Watson. You could hear the huge Collective sigh of relief from Government all over the country. The Only person that could finger Zuma and Senior Politicians "Something Fishy "The ""Cleaners"" got there quick or were following. The Guy that was in the passenger seat with his foot on the Gas was strapped in tight and ducked afterwards to catch his lift." "Gavin Watson didn't develop a Conscience overnight. He was cocky that no-one would finger him
Born free,🤣🤣🤣🤣 Bomber McBride
mandela Omar,Am late here
Lazar Kostov,why am here?
adrian albertyn,veruska september she is my girl. agreed
Lesego Mosaka,Morninq
Jabu Nhlanhla,hi mosaka
Smart Guys,mc bride freedom fighter apartheid also killed innocent people if you not HAPPY here go back to Europe why u defending apartheid power to the people Amandla 😁😁😁😁😁 agree Nash
Robert Russell,Mc Bride..... child killer Even more funny is how ZUMA became president It's going to be interesting to see how apartheid is used in 23 years time when SA has been living in a democratic society for as long as apartheid was applied to society Oh yes I forgot about those dooses.... @Rob Nel ....exactly my point.... Based on what I have read.... the EEF which is only Mal Enema.... will fail based on him being incarcerated for at least one one of the many charges/allegations against him SAL = SAA Just like we offer big game hunting... we could also offer drive by shooting to our tourist offerings Or sold by our security services Apparently he was dead before he hid the pillar hit* Where is IPID???????
Nyasimi Geoffrey,MORNINGS MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS FROM SA yyyeeeeeeeesssssssss zondo wooooooiiiiiiiii We need you alive to put Zuma away Does this DCJ work out?
Robert Mhlongo,thereis no truth in this world
Rob Nel,"@Smart Guys I was born in RSA "@Smart Guys  "It is meant as a compliment "@rosalind gerber  "@I Am Free  "And free vehicles "Nice hats "I agree Dan "And his main artery was cut "There is a private investigator and private autopsy When is Zuma coming back to commission?? "I mean after Hlaudi
Mbuso Ndlovu,Hi combades AMMAANNDDLLAA!! 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
nhlanhla nkosi,I though this is state of capture commission not apartheid commission nor xenophobia commission. can chat about that Michael where are you some people needs to be blocked here coz this is about state capture nothingelse u only chatting to 2k people about all that past and it won't make any difference about our future. but Wat Is happen here with this state capture thing will make a difference in our future
Sindiswa Moolman,We have one Witness you has just died... Gavin Watson. Just tuned in guys... did I miss something? And the best in Africa @I Am Free
Kevin Simon,I Am Free ​even tho there was no black people in south africa at that time.. well only in KZN And those in KZN were trying to colonize the rest of the country!!!
Le Roux Strydom,"Please use this platform appropriately
Danie Nilsen,"@Robert Russell that piece of info will not enter into 90 persent of eff minds as relevant issues are for the above 70 persnt IQ and not on the borderline of 30 persent they are teaching the youth thier own corrupt ways and so the applecart just get more rotten
Nash Aniruth,Say No to Racism South African Illuminati "Yes The mandate of this commission should be extended to investigate deaths ordissapearances of implicated inviduals "Infact "Infact this commission has more dignity than parliament "integrity "Gert "Even if nobody goesto jail now "True "I am free they so happy thy going home early
Moshoeu Mabusela,"South Africans @rosalind gerber They also added their own corruption to burden the collapsed system
Richard Nyila,The ANC government has failed its voters or its people in many ways. The fact that they rewarded the cadre deployment with no skills or prerequisite for certain departments hence this mess
Thapelo Motabogi,this is a serious matter "ANC HAS FAILED
Margareth Waterboer,I hope some people on here listen to the evidence and not just sexualise the enquiry because it’s a pretty woman.. it’s sickening...how some men view ladies...h
rosalind gerber,@Derrick saperstein The ANC inherited an inherently corrupt system. and probably had a lot of favors to repay so should the politicizing of key SOE positions The state was functioning in 1994 - it needed to be maintained it would be great to be able to have national pride again Agreed @Rob Nel although the Nats were corrupt but managed to keep it to the top echelons and still hold the state in regard
Radha Krishna,The transcripts for the hearing impaired is hilarious if not crazy. General Allah..... for God's sake!!!
Deon de Swardt,It is obvious that State Capture runs deep into the state departments ... Cadre deployment should STOP !!
clive oconnell,A SAPS snake with so many heads 🐍 "Nash Too true Who will give EFF slap 👋 it’s now illegal
Willem Drotsky,David saperstein agree a life sentence behind bars means for ever. You must have the right to optionally request a death penalty as optional. My personal right not to spend my whole life in jail.
gert pretorius,"Indeed Nash All humans are free but a small group knows it "If yes but "Well said Nash 👍 QUESTION.... how will the ANC collective take responsibility for this ?????????
danie schoeman,The crocodile tears was only shed because no more R300000 per month.
Sthakathi Khumalo,I feel for September shame... she was given a very hard part of state capture and Zondo is not having it. Stay strong mbokodo you will learn one day
