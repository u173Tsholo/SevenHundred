Kay Kay,at least they are punctual today. 🙏🙏 But I've no problem with the sound on my side "@Yin Yan "@Makhuva Michael who's the witness? "@luxolo So he was forced to come lie to the commission? Hopefully Mr. Naidoo will present his story today he recorded the conversation he said "@nyamisi Khuba is honest
Derrick saperstein,Should be an exiting day. My volume is at 50% and I hear perfectly. "JAN
Jane .Blamire,Mr Zondo looks tired. @carol berry Agree. He needs to make sure all facts are strengthened. Very important You have to have respect for these honest investigators who tried to do their best with all this back stabbing going on. And the courage to stand up for what is right! I applaud them... They better start building new jails for all these corrupt people. when it starts it will go fast He should be compensated. agree After this witness
Nelson Musoliwa,The demeanor point on Col Naidoo is interesting Khuba answers are not so much precise mostly vague and kight Thando is 100% correct Zondo takes lot of time in trivial things that needs few words to ask and lead Ja Thando i agree he doesn't seem to be sharp minded like CJ Mongoang but lets hope he will be able to summarize findings ok
Makhuva Michael,Swifamba switika Hosini Enaka we are watching Mr kadafi Himself correct the Adv looks scared of something hey Really the volume is poor I think since Mr Z took over is where we stated to have problems of everything. Mine is 100% but very low to listen to Mr Z knows where is the individuals who took for themselves i wonder My Brother if today we still talk about apartheid while us Black people in control.should be arrested already. Mr Z Broke the code of ANC ask Me why. got it thank "Not Zondo but Mr Zuma why He is not Supported by some of the members

Speckled Trim,"When did State Capture start? The exact moment I think it's when the private sector captures government through tenders and partnerships. Who filled that position before the Guptas? Pheladi same here 👍 lol why ban me? I'm on topic When were the first high-profile Private/Public partnerships formed in SA? "Lol *smash: I like potatoes 🥔🥔🥔
Mario Johnson,morning everybody
Pheladi Lamola,Morning Mario @Brother Louis I don't think we'll ever know the exact moment state capture started but I sure would like to see its end date in my lifetime. Where is Nhleko? Is he still a minister in I'm Shocked's cabinet? Well said Mr Khuba. We can't let ambition cancel out integrity. Zondo o rata ditaba😂😂😂 He doesn't miss anything I know Diana😂😂😂 it's just the way he said it 🤣🤣 "Khuba is very clever. Doesn't say much I believe him Mangalani.

Pastor J.J,@I Am Free A very big Amen to that Absolutely @I Am Free . Your last statement is so very true. Sadly money has also become an enslaver to those that now serve in Ministry as well. I train and mentor new Pastors now in my retirement. I insist on training those that will serve for the love of the Lord rather than the money.@I Am Free @Luxolo T.D Todolo Very well said @Gee Peex1 I think you meant Brian and not Brain. @Roza essack He will not be appearing at this commission. @Roza essack It has been decided that he will give evidence in camera at a private location due to the witness protection programme that he is in. @Jacqui Baumgardt Which is your absolute favourite samoosa Jacqui? @Jacqui Baumgardt Curry Beef? You should try the curried Tinfish. The absolute best.

Luxolo T.D Todolo,The Witness is emotional because of the hardship of working yourself up to the top and corrupt people try to take the meaning of your struggle away to benefit their greed and Tarnish your Reputation. "@Kay Kay  "@Gee Peex1  @Gee Peex1 .. Him and Anoj Singh were the culprits behind corrupt Eskom payments and He cried because he got caught with curry on his hands.
