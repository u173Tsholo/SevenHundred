Annette Peploe,hello everyone
Wesley M,does this inquiry carry weight because even Cyril is corrupt???? our head of state!!! we have to get rid of the ANC first Sibusiso I don't know where your issue is with my statement but I'll confirm my statement for you Ramaphosa is corrupt. the ANC is the evil I our society!!!!!! I'm not white my grandfather is a sotho Sibusiso he is corrupt that's why he is failing to stop corruption. "when they said to ace your son's cannot receive tenders from Gov he said ""why not others are billionaire from Gov tenders"" and ace is right. he ment cyril. Sibusiso" the ANC makes it impossible for anybody to stop corruption because everybody in the ANC is corrupt Sibusiso Cyril Ramaphosa is corrupt!!!!!!!! it's not hate speech our biggest problem is the ANC. ALL of them even Pravin. All of them. look beyond Black and White and Indian???!!!??!!! "whoever the ANC appoints wherever our downfall ladies and gentlemen is the ANC. you can make whoever their leader it will not work. "how did Cyril become a billionaire? through government tenders. so Ace Magashule is right when he asks Luvuyo that's our other problem. we don't have a replacement for the ANC. I'm going to vote for Herman Mashaba or ff+ I'm not sure yet. but eventually I vote for South Africa. not a person or party. "guys you're not saying anything I'm just saying we can no longer continue with the ANC. they are playing sick games with us lol!!! "I will vote FF+ even if it's a white party I will take Ace anytime because Ace is upfront. Ramaphosa is sly. he is a dangerous person. remember Ramaphosa got the brothers in marikhana killed Mr Zulus lies is making him tyred Gauteng contract????? asking himself Mr Zulu just say I'm guilty!! lol!!! "thats what I mean when I say the ANC is playing sick games with us. if you don't understand he can't answer when is Ramaphosa testifying???? Mr Zulu is a Tsotsi!! the people are afraid to sing there buy Zonda and it's the shell road to fame there. they must sing "you must sing Mr Zulu lol!! it's too hot to sing there how will Ramaphosa save the country he is corrupt himself. how did he became a billionaire???? I didn't know asbestos can bite sing Mr Zulu. why are you speaking in a deep voice now?? you sound guilty lol!! comfort break Mr Zulu don't need toilet he's burning "when is msholoza coming back we are waiting for Mr Zulu to come out off the cooler. he was frying a bit lol!! the relationship between human beings and money!?!? eventually business will be more important than politics. kids ar Mr Zulu is cooler now maybe we'll get info from him now lol!! overheating again yhooooo!! puzzle is coming together money all our politicians are businessman and women. all of them. "we need to do away with the ANC yes family and friends also. even Cyril's sons are getting gov business we only talk about Duduzane and ace's sons even Lindiwe Zulu daughter opened businesses when she was small business minister Sibusiso Lindiwe Zulu's daughter was the only one who profited from her being small business minister. cause real small business entrepreneurs got no assistance from gov. in her time sad "Malena also Mzala do your research Mzala how did Ramaphosa become a billionaire??? the one who did business with bosasa "It's funny Mzala Mzala he did business with Bosasa who did business with state departments like Brian shiwambu did business with VBS Mzala how did Ramaphosa become a billionaire? Ace had an interview with Samkele go listen to that Mzala we buy Savannah cigarettes freely from my friend for R70 wich was R20 before the lockdown. The Savannah that is owned by the Italian.

Phenduka Sibhidla,Dep Chief justice Zondo is the man.. I am loving this exchange between Mr Zulu and Mr Pretorius 🤔 Mr Zulu's responses... Mr Z looks overconfident That may be his mistake... Legal minds... They will put you in a corner and leave you to look for an exit... "Mr Z was adviced to use teo words: "" assume"" and ""context"".." This is getting interesting.. That's why I love LAW... Mr Z is assuming a lot lately... Mr Z is constantly assuming... """Context""...." "I ""assume"" that we are all following the Commission...🤣🤣🤣🤣" Mr Pretorius is aware that Mr Z is begging to crack. He's throwing all the punches now... Mr Z's guards are low... Mr Z better assume correctly in the next coming 15mins.. Otherwise he's done I love the legal profession with all my heart...😊😊😊 comfort break!!! Mr Z must just go and prepare himself... Let's just get over and done with assumptions... paper trail...

If we do not share interests you have no way of telling me what's best for me and who to vote for. Me & FF+? @Barbara Sattler I did not say you did and I did not mention your name. You intervened whilst I was discussing with someone else. I am still waiting for you to clarify your question Mashaba will only succeed in destabilizing the foray of the DA into the townships @Barbara Sattler "08/02/2018 · Durban - Flamboyant and politically-connected Durban businessman Mabheleni Ntuli "09/02/2018 · Durban – Politically-connected Durban businessman @Wesley Myburgh Which sons of Cyril got business from the state and from which department?

After 1998 the economy went down You can see how guilty he is😆🤨 Boom!😆 He got silenced! You will see all of this will be forgotten and this man won't be arrested.
