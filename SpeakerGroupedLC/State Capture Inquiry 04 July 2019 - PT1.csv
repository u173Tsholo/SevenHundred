makhosi nobhatyi,😃😂😂😂 translation again 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ lies Same interpreter of yesterday Much better in tswana translation @Derick mampuru how can these guys represent us but not feeling comfortable to speak English "@Philip Cwazibe I am so surprised becoz asiwutholi umsebenzi uma siwufuna xa singakwazi uthetha English These guys holding these positions must make space for us coz something is not right here "Kolwana is back in the country @Aniceth De missamou hey I don’t think so people like these it is easy to be bribed Why do you accept ordinary people to be applied there Does something like this happen b4 or is it just something new? Why would you broke the protocol? They are all running away to the fact to jeopardize the meaningful of the report These visitors are not for president or government officials why did they allow plane to land there? @Dominic Przybylski you won’t see anything immediately give President at least two years results won’t come quickly as you here institutions was broken for corruption and fraud "@Dominic Przybylski yes was there for past 5 years "@Dominic Przybylski CR  "@ Dominic Przybylski please don’t be a opposition "Maleka "@Dominic Przybylski I understand you Anderson must account together with ambassador kolwana "@Noluthando Gosa they must know something if not tell us why did they behave like that That is how Guptas train this mafia at Saxon world don’t sign anything let someone else to sign 😂😂😃😃 I like wat I heard here Zuma compromise SA for his self enrichment and friends
stephen raubenheimer,lol
Derick Mampuru,Is he interpreting is Tswana or Zulu "okay @Phillip Cwazibe isn't he the same person "probably 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ @Phillip Cwazibe "@Makhosi nobhatyi it's still early "@Anne M. and it's our money that's paying him "@Prudence Mokoena 😂 you're so right "in as much as he has the right to get an interpreter when are they returning?
Cassius Mngomezulu,Molweni This guys are playing here
Thami Ngwenya,kunzima Ke tsotsi ye just by looking Molly how are you Judge is taking over leading to save time Derek you starting now
Bruce Andrew,The new tactic to delay the enivitable. Tswana I don't know why South Africans put up with the nonsense that we do.
Prudence Mokoena,😂 there we go again😂😂 He looks so much like yesterday's witness😯 "No no
Zola Pinda,gives them time lokuxoka these are goverment for working there for years and conduct business in English. gvt officials they are playing games. they spoke English when allowing the Guptas to land their aircrafts.
Sinethemba Sakuba,these guys can speak English man this is Madness that's what their exactly trying to do Check the smirk on the that guys face he can hear English but cant speak hahahahahahahahha but gets commands at work in English hahahaha
Thapelo Motabogi,something is wrong here 😂😂😂😂 "these guys speaking in their language they are just wasting our time "he's not speaking setswana well 😂😂😂😂 ke o o araba ka sekgowa 😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂 "i said it
Petro Forsyth,Sure the judge knows Tswana
Phillip Cwazibe,Yesterday's interpreter (isiZulu) spoke poor isiZulu. @Derick Mampuru looks like. Money making? @ Derick Mampuru. It is the Tax payer. @Makosi Nobhatyi Ambassador yonke. @ Aniceth De Missamou he is much comfortable with English @ Phumla Setlhoke it does seem so. The interpreter 🚮 @ Thami Ngwenya indeed Derek Main ​@Molly Dhlamini I think so - someone who takes what does not belong to them without owners permission/consent. @ Yose Human What have we done as a nation of Zulus. Irritant is repeating what has been said in English. eh eh eh eh eh eh njalonjalo @Dominic Przybylski ​I you should not be held liable for misdeeds of past generations. Each person is liable for his/her own personal achievement motivation. "Wonder whether Guptas were not seeing themselves as State President
Anne M.,"@Thulani Bukani It makes one think @Derick Mampuru The Commission pays the interpreter @Derick Mampuru Correct @goolamv Me too. She strikes me as a no nonsense lady. @Sofia Sofia Because their request for a plane side reception was denied. @Phillip Cwazibe I think the Guptas were quite happy to sit behind JZ and others and reap the benefits of tenders and other stuff. "Acting Director General of Department of Military Veterans
Millicent Shozi,haibo im learning mzansi for sure @free man no thugs this roaming in state private jets @goolamv im proud EFF yes where is this Anderson. come answer for yourself @dominic beggars do that you must be one looking for integrity in a rubbish bin "so you think you found one for lunch im going to parktown commission of inquiry to have my share in the buffet
carnoth ngomane,"People have a right articulate themselves in a language of their comfort even some state leader do use interpreters so stop criticizing the witness "@Norman Zwane well said "@Robert Russell absolutely @Robert Russell true that but for articulation purposes he can choose the language of his comfort will the evidence be different if he was speaking in English? Lets learn to love and appreciate our languages and remember speaking english fluently doesnt mean you are intelligent @Sofia Sofia SO IT WOULDNT BE A JOKE IF HE WAS GIVING EVIDENCE IN ENGLISH "@Sofia Sofia the point is the witness chose the language of his comfort and there shoulndt be so issue with that "@Sofia Sofia no offence @Sofia unfortunately they do "@Thando Nkutha im enjoying it as well @Derek Main you are correct politicians always say what we wanna hear and do the opposite "@Thando Nkutha Talk with no action is fruitless
Robert Russell,Next we gonna have the sign language dude from Madibas funeral To welcome Tswana speaking foreign visitors to the country It's the new game plan.... use interpreters so that when Zuma appears on the 15th.... they will run out of time before the 19th because of this tactic and he will not answer all the questions @carnoth ngomane so would it be ok for Zuma to use an interpreter when he appears? Yes it's his right.... but he understands and speaks Engilsh better than most @carnoth ngomane I will put my house on it that Zuma will use a translator just to waste time and money as well as frustrate the commission @Molly Dhlamini.... The DCJ Zondo is also Zulu so why does he not use a translator then..... English is clearly note his mother tongue I'll answer that for Derek..... it's spelt ANC IMHO @Derek Main .... they stole more than most @Ibo Thabo.... same argument as yesterday that someone posted.... how about America and the Red Indians.... guess that is not a big enough success story for you YOH and also writes in English Apparently so @Sofia Sofia It's just getting the commission ready for when Zuma is here @Sofia Sofia I guess the Guptas had a translator at all their Shabeen meetings with Zuma ....just to make sure he got it right as to who to appoint for looting purposes. @Dominic Przybylski..... remember you saying a few days ago that you did a stint at a mine in SWA.... what year was that? @Dominic Przybylski..... does Marik Jagiela mean anything to you? Ok just checking he is from Poland and jumped ship in SWA to seek political asylum for the very same reason .... he became my brother inlaw @Dominic Przybylski What Nationality is this man? Now I see why no one knew about it....... they were all talking past each other using different languages.... hence the need for translators at the commission @Norman Zwane...thank you for your vote of confidence.... however the official language of the ANC is LIES not English I think that after 3 years of bullshit disciplinary hearings... she eventual retired @Noluthando Gosa And his home language is not ENGLISH.... impressive
Zamuxolo Mbangcolo,He responds before interpretation.😂😂😂
Thulani Bukani,he's answering English nje lomjita I'm thinking of blocking Yose. always Zulu this and Zulu that. come on bra. We are dealing with Waterkloof here You are the tribalist Yose mfondini Yes @Solomon and ANC hasnt changed much since then
Lukhanyo Makahla,"its gonna be boring today why this dude answering in English? "lol the interpreter
Joburg CEB Lion,"This is not play ground "Believe there is no delay tactics. Language is very important. Let's ignore the language
Thabo Nejelele,He's right to testify in language he feel comfortable. ubaba will testify in zulu.
Norman Zwane,Spoken well per this intepreter our languages are just beautiful. I'm enjoying the seTswana guy. "@Sinethemba Sakuba The language of office work is usually easy to deal with over time but for most people court language remains foreign. Unless you are exceptionally fluent "@Sinethemba Sakuba If you understand English @Aniceth De Missamou Home language is a right we all have to truly express ourselves. I may work in English but court is not work @Aniceth De Missamou The constitutional recognition of our home languages was to ensure that the principle of equality before the law is not slanted to favour the dominant. Just accept it. @Deon February I think we dealing with folks who have no idea how frustrating it is to be misunderstood. You get spoken to in a language that is secondary to your instinct to protect yourself. "@Ibo Thabo @I Am Free is a troll don't go down that line The big players in the ANC used these small guys and then let them hang out to dry. "@Molly Dhlamini @Yose Human @I Am Free are trolls @Tikvah Olam Its not a crime to ask for translation. It is equally not a crime to understand English as well. None is exclusive. I know a lot of people who can conduct a conversation better in both Most folk do not know what WHITE PRIVILEGE IS: White privilege is expecting that all people should converse only in your language and to then suspect use of another language as being evasive. @Sofia Sofia You did not. He said he prefers to respond in his home language - any problem there? He never said he does not understand English. He made a constitution allowed choice. "@clive oconnell Geez!! Are you an expert at stating the obvious or you just being thick? Where else in the world big as it is @Sofia Sofia If you are referring to the man on the stand then I think you are off your rocker to be making a judgement of corruption of this man. WHITE PRIVILEGE raises suspicion of Tswana speakers. @Thando Nkutha Well done Thando. I wish I did too. Shamefully I was one of those stupid ones who looked down Tsonga and Venda - for no reason except I was just too proud to learn. "@Thando Nkutha Right now ""nditota ku amba tshiVenda""I know I've bastardised the writing as well." @Thando Nkutha I was once at Turf and had a moVhenda girlfriend but stupid me never took advantage and learnt. Pathetic really. Not proud of that little bit of my past. "@Thando Nkutha You have quite a spread of South African routes @Thando Nkutha Wow! @Thando Nkutha In my lineage I find there was great frowning for marrying outside tribal lines hence my limited natural spread of relations in other tribal languages. @Phumla Setlhoke Now that is funny LOL "@Thando Nkutha At least you did not grow up in townships with Zulu section "@Thando Nkutha Yes "@Thando Nkutha I always have to stop myself when we argue with my kids "@Dominic Przybylski Makes sense "@Derek Main True dat. Some numb-bnuts think it devious "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux I'm arguing about language "@Dominic Przybylski Inheritence is a natural phenomenon so I'd be reluctant to go there at all.I think our problem precedes the inheritence @Dominic Przybylski You directing that questions about Zulus to me Dominic? @Dominic Przybylski I'd rather not as this does not follow from our earlier engagement. I'll give you space to speak to yourself. Soon you should be hearing yourself I think. @Luvuyo Zantsi I sure enjoy reading Ledwaba's decisions. I dont always agree with his reasoning but I just enjoy his legal logic. I find it fascinating- my apologies to those he finds against. @Thando Nkutha @Luvuyo Zantsi Is this not the kind of judgement Malema hoped Ngcukaitobi would get in order to take it to the CONCOURT? I know he ranted in Pressa but I thought that is what he said @Thando Nkutha He is still my fav judgement writer. One man's meat mta ka Nkutha kwasho amaNgisi @Nathaniel Perumal Hey Nathaniel is Trump going to be parading his weaponry as he threatened he might - just so we know what weaponry he has?? @Thando Nkutha I had my final teaspoons of love for Julius spilled yesterday. I thought the PRESSA was not necessary and I think he came across as a bully. So from now I'm in the other camp "@Thando Nkutha When you said Julius I was still talking about Justice Ledwaba "@Thando Nkutha In my limited history of the ANC @Thando Nkutha So much blood has been shed because peeps could not hear each other. @Thando Nkutha I go with that @Robert Russell I vote you to chair this commission. we would have a one line finding:ALL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES MUST SPEAK ENGLISH. @Robert Russell Talking of commission @Dominic Przybylski Why do you say that? @Dominic Przybylski That defines the prty or the leaders tendencies or there is no difference between the two for you?

Aniceth De Missamou,The guy is responding in English. It's a ploy for avoid stating much. They are soldiers and work for the Gov not in a Base so how do they run the Gov business with foreigners dignitaries? "So he can read email and respond to them with foreigners dignitaries but can't express himself in English at an enquiry? These soldiers "These are soldiers and everything to them is ""War"" and all tactics are permissible to win" @makhosi nobhatyi you're right. The you needs to invade the ANC so they can take over.

Derek Main,@Molly Dhlamini The ANC is for looters and thieves - no matter what language they speak. @Molly Dhlamini It's been proven over and over again. More of that will come out here at the commission. @Molly Dhlamini I think so - someone who takes what does not belong to them. @Molly Dhlamini All ANC deployees seem to be thieves. That is not to say they are the only thieves but the is looting of public funds by ANC cadres at all levels of government. @Molly Dhlamini Are you saying the ANC cadres have not been stealing public funds? @Molly Dhlamini Please explain what the relationship between capitalist system and state have to do with stealing public funds. @Robert Russell At every possible opportunity. @Molly Dhlamini Sounds like a cop-out to me. @Molly Dhlamini Why don't you answer the question - do you deny that ANC cadres have been stealing public funds? @Molly Dhlamini Still waiting.... @Glorify Gumede Are they protesting the exposure of their criminality? @Glorify Gumede No - I don't know. They may be protesting but I think it's more that they feel better able to answer in their own mother tongue. @Glorify Gumede @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU That's a serious accusation - you are saying that they are obstructing justice. "@Norman Zwane I think you are correct. As far as I know @Norman Zwane It takes all sorts... @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Yes - of course - pure speculation. @Thando Nkutha Never forget that Julius was instrumental in Zuma taking charge. @Thando Nkutha Damage was already done. @Thando Nkutha Julius (like all politicians) is an opportunist. They all say what we want to hear.

Nelson Musoliwa,The witness leader is seemingly new or intern Pathetic that seasoned officials suddenly got confused with system they are accustomed to.

Dominic Przybylski,International language of communication should not be a 1st language of any country. It should be done in an international 2nd language like Esperanto. "What is zulu for ""ambassador"" and ""personal assistant""?" I have the privilege of perceiving myself as an individual rather than as a skin colour. I guess that's probably seen as white privilege. "@Yose Human I had hopes for CR but ain't seen nothing yet. How as ""Ramaphosa changed our lives""?" "@makhosi nobhatyi I hope you're right. My problem with CR is he was 2nd in command during the ""wasted 10 years"" but claims to have been ""shocked"" by everything which happened when we all knew." @makhosi nobhatyi He must have been reading some of the same newspapers that I was reading. "@makhosi nobhatyi I'm still hoping "@clive oconnell Nothing is for free. Once in power the liberation movements are obliged to indoctrinate people same as their leaders were indoctrinated by the providers of ""free weapons""." "@Michael Wild ""your highness"" should just about cover any situation." "@makhosi nobhatyi I hear you @makhosi nobhatyi NPA is [hopefully] being repaired but I don't see CR asserting himself in his own party. I suspect that is partly a problem of its philosophy which denies individual leadership. "@Norman Zwane I think it is just for practical reasons We need to understand that in 4th Industrial Revolution technology is the leading edge and most of it is specified in English. There isn't enough time to 'waste' it translating into other languages. The world is moving too fast for that. @Norman Zwane Yes apartheid gave whites privilege with regard to land ownership and that privilege has been inherited by current generation. Should any form of inheritence be allowed? Can inheritence be disallowed retrospectively? What are the limits? "If Zulus conquered other tribes and took their land "@Norman Zwane I'm kind of speaking to myself My father's family home was nationalised by communist government after 2nd World War. Now my own home is being threatened with the same by a new communist government.
