Chosen One,@Tikvah Olam not any more. @Lubabalo Qamata I think it's just to inform the public about the corruption crippling the country. So we can make better decisions in the future.
Pheladi Lamola,"Very happy that the commission got the extension. Hopefully they'll make full use of this time 🤦‍♀️ They need to reign him in otherwise he'll be here for a week. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Now he's got the judge preaching I agree @James Godloza. That's why I was so happy yesterday when they got the extension. I want them to complete their work and inform us in the process That Mawela guy from Multichoice must come to the commission as well. 😂😂😂 this guy Yeah he's too long-winded in his responses Time flies when you're having fun
