As much as I am opposed to the death penalty @Quest Yes - Chair must ask him to not speak so loudly into the mic (for a change). When are they going to ask him questions about Guptas and Optimum? @michael kalamoudacos Yes but surely they could have asked him here too. The only reason I can think is because this part was only about TNA

Elyou Rossouw,In my mind We all stray sometime..lol What does this guy know?? I DON'T KNOW...yoooh!! He never looked at anything at that time. Hard to say.....yes and no would be sufficient. "@Thulani Bukani "Im my mind Cocky Would hate to work for him... does or would not listen to reason at all. His way or the highway.

Shorayi Mapfumo,m sincerely praying positively for a very successfull innauguration of my democractically elected president MEK Masisi tomorrow. let it rain just like on his first appointment
Smart Guys,Hello heather
Thulani Bukani,granit has been blocked im happy with Hofmeyer she showed enough rubbish in his story the things he says dont add up "he just sounds confident "@Sthakathi Khumalo yes he's been consistent. but he's all over the place weather the board has a responsibility to look after the states money. sometimes yes so in some issues he's consistently inconsistent yes @Buyani Mhlongo @Heather Cotton are you talking about the witness? why this clown shouting like this? i dont know what this lawyer was trying to prove
Pheladi Lamola,They must adjust the aircon in this venue. DCJ is always having the flu. So did he work for Gupta company and was Eskom board member as well? These guys really had it easy. Being a lawyer must be hard. Imagine having to represent people who stole your taxes!!
Muzi Ntuli,43 million just for breakfast...these acts by these people was and still a clear indication how the public fund was stolen through bogus nonsensical creation of breakfast
Kena,But guys why do you dignify Granit’s stupidity with responses? Let him talk to himself cause clearly he is bored
Kevin Simon,Mark sounds like a waste of money as an Eskom director. Hope no other company ever uses him!!! "Pheladi Lamola ​So did he work for Gupta company and was Eskom board member as well? That seems to be the case "I must say I am beginning to like the Chinese system. If there is a hint of corruption you get isolated. If found guilty Re-examination may not swing DCJ's opinion. He knows that it is rehearsed to help the witness sound better informed. I don't think it helps the Commission much but is probably just to be fair. So he is listing all others that should also have been called or will be called. This guy has much to answer for on the Optimum mine deal and cancellation of the fines on the sale to Oakbay.
szkott ridli,hello
Thabang Letsosa,Heavy breathing the witness is giving there.
Moses Pitso,lol lesoetsa
Buyani Mhlongo,is this lawyer? is this his lawyer? Why is he sounding so arrogant to him as well? "I don't understand @Abel Matshidiso LOL LOL Rugby WHat is his name? Thanks @Rob Nel
