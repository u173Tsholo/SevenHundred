Born free,Born realist Africa has had the opportunity to rise but continues to fall and fail exactly and that is why the poor are rising I don't detect a French accent or Portuguese. No they have not yet played the recordings that is still to come Neptune Was to start at 8am but late again Ground handling is any service from ground to aircraft Brian Van Wyk is a black man and not Afrikaans Yes and also ministers of the ANC Luthuli house looting and diverting funds for the ANC campaigns R31 million to be exact. It was money from the public purse meant to improve the lives of of the poor and keep State owned entities afloat. Hopefully Judge Zondo will bring those recommendations when he concludes his report. Zuma has to pay R16million in legal expenses. Thank goodness he can no longer use taxpayers money to keep him from facing justice. Zuma has been ordered by the court to pay he has to comply. No it did not succeed as Ramaphosa was ripped off. tipped off A gangster Mafia I wish that Police Commissioner would change his gangster hat he looks like a gangster from the hood Zuma will have to sell Nkandla to pay for his legal expenses. Yes I will lend you the bus Yes Ramaphosa must watch his back he is surrounded by enemies Yes Pastor you are right we all have a common purpose and a common goal.. to make South Africa great üòÅ That behaviour by the EFF is unacceptable The EFF have to comply or they will be broke from all the lawsuits and won't have funds to fund their party of thugs. I just love it when the EFF lose all their appeals and then are hit with costs. VBS is public servants pension funds these people will crucify the EFF I have faith in this commission the big fish will fry but only after the conclusion of Zondos report and recommendations. I want to see all the big corrupt looters go down Nepotism As the law specifies : you are innocent until proven guilty Not an exciting witness

sanele songelwa,looks like Meyni turned SAA in to a charity for the rich to be richer.... "we continue to be poor This is money that can create jobs and keep closing componies afloat.. are they even going to be charged? "When is the big"" Shark"" being called in (Zuma)?" NPA is going to let them pay half the money and let them go.. is that going to be fair? He is the cause of it all. because he does not have the taxpayers money in his pocket and his money is almost finished.. "if the gupta aircraft did not land uneducated president spent money he cannt even pronounce.. does he even deserve to be invited? "@Sebation u write Thuli was tougher than Mkhwebane loool not this time.. The commer They still have VBS moola.. @Jabu not even an attempe "Agrizzi does not even deserve to be there Eskom is drowning with its debts..
Moeneeb Martin,Theres no difference between local and foreign. There is just greedy and dishonest people. regardless of where they come. @Robert Russell thats off topic. stay on point bru. Thats a topic for another day and another platform.
Isaac Mavuso,They worked us well. The current state of our country signals problems with the roots.
Ben Cole,People can be charged at any time. There is no obligation to wait for the final Zondo report. Not parliament's job to decide who gets charged or not. Only NPA decides after either SAPS or Hawks investigation. Also no reference to race today please. "Salmaan Abrahams
Thando Tomson,.....but that will be the NPA/Parliament's job to charge implicated people...? the commission is the means to do damage control - as a result of what JZ did

Robert Russell,Or a paid sperm donor @Kevin Allister Simon Zuma will not be at SONA Her was not at CR's inauguration either The white shirts are going to have to be on alert tonight as there now more EFF thugs in parliament to beat them up who are YOU to decide what is discussed on this forum @Moeneeb Martin Careful Born Free...... according to Moeneeb.... the EFF is off limits today @Sebation Nantsika ...that position has gone to the IFP Crime has no colour.... @Salmaan Abrahams Jabu has a point SAFA crooked their books to the tune of R100m Lyn Brown should be shot..... who paid for Mbakes trip to DUBAI....
