barbara broadbent,"Amazing how ppl can be so naive!! where do you think the likes of CR and company get their money for campaigning
Mmoloki Moloi,democracy is under siege
Lorna Kavanagh,.... and where does Eff get all the money to go to court and lose ....
Kevin Simon,Problem is the equity in the name of the ANC in the mind of the electorate. Else just form a new party. See where that got MANY smaller parties in May! Think CR should go Zondo and just spill the beans. "The issue of timing of these matters being URGENT is a theme in most of the cases. Even the CFO for SAA landed on a burning platform Derek Main ​The entire ANC is corrupt - from top to bottom. Agreed!!!!!!!
