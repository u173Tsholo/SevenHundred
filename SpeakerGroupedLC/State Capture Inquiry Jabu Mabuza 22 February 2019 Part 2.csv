Zuma cabinet was full of his supporters and Nwc Niyakhathalisa nina maan shut up we are listening Nowonder what matshela koko did say after this evidence? He just appeared on criticism the board and executive of Eskom for load shedding which koko and others are there cause of this üò≥üò≥ Ace Magashule is coming also he must account "üòÄüòÄüòÉüòÉ Ace Magashule is finish long time Koko in trouble hawks are looking for him @Thando Nkutha koko is a big liar they did load shedding in purpose "True we must all defend Ramaphosa

Zola Marali,Corrupt official must go to Jail it's high time that President to disbound all the boards in government they useless just money spenders through meeting. exactly Grant Wilkinson
Kisten Pillay,too long corruption is going on must lock all corrupt officials because in New Zealand if the officials used tax payers money to buy a cup of tea for a family member it is a big thing.

Thabang M,maleka is getting bored‚ö†Ô∏èüòÇ üòâCoffee please
Sthakathi Khumalo,"Pravin Gordans name keeps propping up "Felix Muyoba Its not that we don't believe "Theo Bhengu He is a product of the taxi business haha.. and you know what they say Paul Mufhadi But that is just a petty argument.. What needs to happen is to vote all of them out!! CR7 and Zuma have been commanding the reigns at ANC for many years. They can't blame one person!! makhosi nobhatyi Lols.. why are you looking at the chats leWena?? Is he reading answers If a board was structured in such a way that they don't know what they are doing. haaai suka they are all wasting our time. These are pure mechanics of wanting to privatise Lets carry on aiwa Lets do an hour chair
Thapelo Motabogi,they should ask mabuza about dirk herman and the rest of white people who are still benefiting them only while blacks continue to suffer at eskom mabuza is feeding us false information and he has failed "makhosi don't ever question things you know nothing off because you sound like a fool now "true "and the sad part is that they target black people but whites continue to benefit and do as they please "you must send me text one's he gets exposed we don't wait to be told what is true and what makes sense. use your brains bra and think "MAKHOSI ARE YOU LISTENING LOL "please ANC GUYS
Glorify Gumede,i just joined now uthini lo baba? awu! uyaxoka?
michael mbatha,and you got paid for all those meetings
Paul Mufhadi,we can kill the ANC by not voting for it The ANC keeps on feeding us with the same wine in a different bottle. ANC prides themselves as clean but defend corruption. who forgets Nkandla!!!!!! This corruptions says a lot about the leadership crisis we face. The ANC puts forward a man like Zuma as their best. seriously? Zuma is the principal and the others are his students. let's vote this corruption out and hold our leaders to account. I agree that voting out this corruption can be done away with it time for ANC to rest in peace. it has failed dismally unfortunately they are taking our country with The implicated parties must be locked away and throw the key. their assets be auctioned and looted money be recouped.
Talent P Sibisi,Jabu Mabuza this is not a Banana State Capture

LOL
Theo Bhengu,This Mabuza looks like a township tsotsi.
Bas Mdaka,"@Theo Bhengu yeah bra
Eslon Eslon,The Zuma's administration brought so many problems and damages to the country in so many ways. The country is bleeding heavily from the state capture project Parliament had given the ANC 8 chances to remove Zuma but they protected him while knowing he's corrupt Zuma was ANC biggest mistake leader of the century. Now they have to do damage control of one man's problems "@Mafuta So Koko also played a part in the looting of his employer? I'm tempted to believe Matshela Koko must have received kick backs for his role in the matter "@Makhosi
Tsebo Malape,@Theo Bhengu Mr Mabuza is a reputable man - lNo maan..lol

VaPunungwe,Just buy more data Selecta The choice between post-colonial corruption and colonial corruption is like asking goats to choose between hyenas and jackals You can't turn around 400 years in 25 years. Especially if you are eating together with the past beneficiaries of corruption Nkandla was small fish compared to Bosasa. And guess who were the main beneficiaries of Bosasa We are not talking about race but corruption But there is no worse corruption than saying if you are black then you have no rights Thay is the beginning of the corruption we have today @wilson machado vote EFF then "The big mistake is not just Zuma. The big mistake is the mentality that seeks to say ""We have arrived"" when you have not even started the journey" @Maria Raboshakga ke a buwa iKalanga
Maria Raboshakga,"This corruption is too much. To think we pay so much for everything but others just take away like they are taking vet koekies. This government must just fall How can we be well when thieves are steeling our country in broad day light!!
