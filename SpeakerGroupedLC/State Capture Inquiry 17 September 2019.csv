Joanita Hilton,oh there we go. comm of police
Jane .Blamire,Only the guilty come with lawyers Secrecy to protect whistle blowers? Article to explain these documents @Mbuso Ndlovu Very brave people Nooooo....i want to hear what is in that document This commission is worth every cent. This is all about exposing. After the NPA etc will have to jump in. Investigate and bring before courts. Colonel Kobus Roelofse... Hawks investigator "B.A. degrees are mainly awarded to students following a programme in the Liberal Arts (e.g. Humanities Very learned man. Got degree then went to police service. Has years of experience Stop dissing the man. He investigated but the culprits in higher up police classified his documents so that's why no prosecutions on his report......so wrong
Salmaan Abrahams,oooooh zondo is sharp this morning ... laying down the law : linguistically too hoya zondo wait ppl who is this lawyer she sounds and looks like a girl from the Cape Flats this one better show the flats has more than tik to offer lol Hlaudi captured me too haha

You must remember two things... the ANC doesn’t own the NPA anymore "All ANC criminals support Zuma He was dead long before he crashed @zintle ndzwangu. It can only mean he was poisoned. I suspect he took cynide just before he crashed. My own suspicions... please. I know @Mzalwana Mzala. I have picked that up too The family says they know who did it. Hope the toxicologist will pick it up @zintle ndzwangu "I think he came here prematurely @Danie Nilsen. Zuma should be come last so that he can respond to all allegations against him. They must Ace Ya @makhosi nobhatyi Supported @benjamin sifundo True @makhosi nobhatyi Is Mdhluli in jail? I remember reading something about him been found guilty of a certain crime My question now @Anne M... does anyone keep the rank if he was discharged through dismissal? Or dishonorably discharged?

This person want attention Mdhluli abused the slush fund @zintle ndzwangu... allegedly Yes @Ewald Kruger and @Pheladi Lamola. And Mdhluli used his connections to abuse his power and the slush fund... The deadline is 31 March 2020. @zintle ndzwangu. Hope the DCJ won’t ask for extension
Immanuel,"R359 m Zondo commission cost tax payers to date its in the public domain news24 had an article on that yesterday Ms September is she an intern or wip (work in progress)as it were? what is a BA degree? does anyone know? "@lydia you have hit the nail on the head @zintle lol🤣🤣🤣 "Gavin left R70 to buy kota for those implicated in the commission. he died without a cell phone which was traced in parts of joburg actually its adv Vincent Maleka🙏 "drilling down into promotions and rank structures of saps or mayb the saps ranks are also captured? is that the purpose of the integration. id not the chair should call ms september to order i think ms september is all over the show in regard to her line of questioning or am i delusional here? or is she saving the best for last? "if someone was promoted unlawfully we dont need a lecture in MISS or saps rank structures @sandile please stop insulting our african sisters tuuu. i find your comments distasteful & way out of proportion for this platform 🙄 logic dictates that one cannot a call a convict general so & so? "if i were to opine

Wilson M,Bheki Cele 🧐
Smart Guys,is their a sound problem? sandile is your mother black?
Mzalwane Mzala,Some people find it difficult to understand that not everyone mentioned in a commission is implicated. Ungancama Mdluli was recently found guilty on this case "'Richard Mdluli found guilty of kidnapping The media ran with the story of looting crime intelligence funds and Mdluli was central to it. I don't remember anyone charged and convicted for that.

Person of interest,"Moses stop trolling
Msihl Pat,Nothing on this planet is as clueless and as corrupt and as useless as the currently sitting black government of South Africa. That useless clueless dumb thing called David Mabuza will be S.A's president. What a godforsaken country this is "If S.A. is still led by black people then even by the year 2099 The best thing to do if you happen to be intelligent enough is to leave this Godforsaken country "No tax of mine will go into their The only thing they will get from me is the unavoidable general tax
Sharing Fam Space,Moses Sandile is racist Boer from gauteng don't worry about him just ignore him guys
C'ben Mutumba,i love south african democracy and freedom of speech..........
