Article to explain these documents @Mbuso Ndlovu Very brave people Nooooo....i want to hear what is in that document This commission is worth every cent. This is all about exposing. After the NPA etc will have to jump in. Investigate and bring before courts. Colonel Kobus Roelofse... Hawks investigator "B.A. degrees are mainly awarded to students following a programme in the Liberal Arts (e.g. Humanities Very learned man. Got degree then went to police service. Has years of experience Stop dissing the man. He investigated but the culprits in higher up police classified his documents so that's why no prosecutions on his report......so wrong

Ungancama Mdluli was recently found guilty on this case "'Richard Mdluli found guilty of kidnapping The media ran with the story of looting crime intelligence funds and Mdluli was central to it. I don't remember anyone charged and convicted for that.
