Dominic Przybylski,@Madelein Huxtable polarisation in response to EFF and BLF. SA is separating into different races again. @Misfit Toys Eh? Corruption is cheating. Yup! DA don't know what they are anymore so voter is bound to lose faith. Only 27% of results in. Gangster Ace will become next president soon.
Khayalethu Tyhoba,ANC Leads Those are in Goverment in waiting can continue with their WAITING Corruption is with everyone in that PARLIAMENT including CIGARRETS party

Gift Handson,The results are not yet confirmed We waiting for finals ANC stole the results
Carnoth Ngomane,@Thando Nkutha They we more focused on discrediting the ANC than pushing their manifestos @Thando Nkutha yes and now ANC needs o fully rid itself from corruption and focus on burning issues "@Thando Nkutha he cant do it alone "@Thando Nkutha yep he needs to be more practical than making the right noises with no action @Misfit Toys dont say things that you cant substantiate "@Misfit Toys thats my point "@Misfit Toys these are issues of national interest and it carries lots of sensitivity with it
Ndlovu Leonard,Is this man the Mandela cran?

delphin yvon Moukouma Mboussi,BLF is leading with their arrogant leader
Magda Seguin,"Top 3 parties leading at present:ANC ANC voters are in need of more suffering and abuse "The UEC did a great job "The full results are still a long way off "Mr Mamabolo explained that the amount of people voting twice will not impact on the results The IEC has a mechanism in place to trace who voted twice and where.Everyone has been so emotional and paranoid even spreading fake news on Twitter. "Sowetan just published a photo of voters in booths facing a wall "I watched all the IEC press conferences throughout the night
Tumelo Digashu,one two one two
Born free,KFC for tea Well The ANC had better deliver that faith because this is their final and last chance to do so. Roger that The wheels of justice must turn and the corrupt must be accountable and punished. Yes C R will have to be very Sulligent and selective choosing ministers with integrity and intelligence. dilligent The ANC will have to govern with transparency in that all Government entities must publish the financial aspects costs and procurementsabd Audits for the public to see. No-one should be a President or a minister or public servant where there may be a conflict of interest. Hopefully the EFF supporters have seen through Julius Malena and his hoodlum party. "If the ANC do not deliver on its manifesto rather march to the Presidents house I don't think any amount of rigging would make the difference. Aficans are not politicians they are people in business with conflicts of interest and serve their own interests. Last chance for the ANC. Yes. South Africans will not tolerate any more corruption. The DA needs more power punch and a clear manifest. Race should not be the criteria. A party can have people of colour that represents what South Africa is.. known as democracy. Julius Malema wants to nationalise all private entities.. that would be the absolute ruin for SA. look at SOEs they have looted all the money and brought SA to her knees . yes this is true about ND Zuma she was captured. There were certainly South African whites who were apposed to apartheid and joined the movement against apartheid. Benni Tandi my sincere sympathy but who were your grandparents killed by the terrorists or who?? We know during the war years that the terrorists killed many of their own people and intimidated them. Barack Obama was the worst US president ever not because he is a coloured man but because of his policies and the trillions identity he contributed to National Treasury. He was selected not elected. Of course black lives matter and their must be progress in this regard. Obama incurred trillions in US dollars if debt to National treasury which President Trump has inherited and has to fix. Stop the hate speech in order to move forward you must look forward. look you cannot undo the past. Must move forward. @Normane Zwane.. what must I correct? I was not part of the apartheid . It's not about race it is about merit. Jacobs showing his face only because the ANC have won. Last chance Jacob but you belong in jail. it's true Felix. Africans were tribes living in mud huts and wearing animal skins and loin cloths when settlers arrived. Read the history books. It was the white settlers that implemented farm schools and education It was white settlers that designed infrastructure and built it ..yes with black labour. This is all part of history. Education started with European settlers. Whites were the first black civilization No I am not a racist at all just talking facts.. historical facts. I am not an apartheid follower just a historian. well the Europeans saw that the black people had not done anything to progress in comparison to Europe. African Tribes fought African tribes Seasons are different in Africa and Europe so yes perhaps that is a true statement.
The Truth,Majority of SA is demonstrating faith in the ANC "@Val Speirs I agree. If ANC doesnt step up this time I Just want to see people being arrested after results are announced "@Val Speirs Yes. And that's how we'll test CR and team. And also FF+ surprisingly getting lots of votes... land issue working to it's advantage "@Thando Nkutha When you vote for a party that made ""mistakes"" South African's are very conscious about their votes @Thando Nkutha Exactly. And thats one of the many factors that are giving ppl faith in the ANC once more "@charu rangka EFF has as much followers as voters You reckon ANC will strengthen significantly after this? "@Thando Nkutha My blood is black "I'm just looking at things objectively. And indeed EFF is growing. But as things stands "@Thando Nkutha Oh i get you. Yes @Thando Nkutha in what way? "@Thando Nkutha He says all the right things "@charu rangka True. But the advantage of State Pres is that he chooses his ministers "@Thando Nkutha haha. 1 that switched me off Juju is when he pushes the Land agenda "In other words "@charu rangka I believe that ppl that CR will choose "Like the Zwane's "@charu rangka Lets wait and see. Only time will tell. But the fact is "@makhosi nobhatyi Well said. We like to complain too much. We get a Pres with Standard 2 The supporters are the party lol @rohan barnard He didnt publicly stand up because he didnt want to ruin the chances of taking over and fixing the mess. ABC's of politics "@Jessica Francis No "@Thando Nkutha there could be more reasons to it @Val Speirs Certainly does feel like the last chance for ANC. CR has his work cut out for him. Winning was the easy part "@rohan barnard Believe me "Vote counting @ 34% "@rohan barnard Thats going to be the test for CR "@Thando Nkutha The reason there's 1 face on the ballot *face aka person "DA lost some to FF+ "@Thando Nkutha Nope "@Thando Nkutha Some of ""the ppl"" you refer to "As for the disbandment "@makhosi nobhatyi Absolutely "Cyril will only have an upper hand if ANC gets +60% votes. Thats the only power he'll have to fight JZ\ND factions currently within Many sections and organizations had\have faith in CR. Let's just continue to pray for him not to dissapoint @makhosi nobhatyi Who do you think should represent women after Bathabz "Yes What about Mme Thandi Modise? True. Politics of individuals within the movement is a dangerous thing "@anthony gray Daubern No one yet "@Thando Nkutha Absolutely. Out of those three "@makhosi nobhatyi JZ was in a corner. He knew he had neutralized the NEC Hai Mmusi must call the bus owner to come drive it himself now haha "@Epica S Epica S Are you awake yet? We voted yday. EFF is at 8.9% now "My only skepticism with CR "@Thando Nkutha And he's family wuld be any better to what the Guptas were to JZ. CR needs to pay attention to this "@Kapn Krunch we are all free "The only day we will move on and look forward "@Norman Zwane @Thando Nkutha It's ppl such as these Nazi's making nonsense here *racialize @Kapn Krunch You are incapable of speaking the truth "@Kapn Krunch First deal with the lie you're living "@Kapn Krunch The lie you live is u know that the white minority r mostly advantaged "@Kapn Krunch The lie you live is that you choose to ignore how black ppl suffered and the hands of your ancestors "@Kapn Krunch So based on those 2 lies "@Lew464 Yes "@Kapn Krunch The ""victim mentally"" is revived by ppl who continue saying ""forget the past "@Kapn Krunch It's like telling a rape victim 2 jst move on with life
ROSE Star,People are really finally being educated on what to expect from their votes. It's due to scarcity of resources that make Africans mostly to look up to politics as a quick source to aquire easy wealth. Our natural resources are being given to the highest bidders as investment.

Kapn Krunch,they still counting votes but it looks like anc will win again even after telkom eskom the guptas and all the rest Cyril still has problems half of his party hold him down so no hes not the best choice as a result of association two wrongs dont make a right buddy I am a born free who wasnt even alive at that time so I cant say if your statement is even true in 1948 my parents weren't even born yet and my entire family was in England stop living in the past its pathetic you never went through that struggle vote ANC but dont cry to us when our tax money doesnt reach the people that's on you sunnyboy no it's not your land go look at history these people cut off their nose to spit their face go on walk around like a victim all your life see where that gets you Barack obama the man who destabilized Libya causing the migrant crisis the same man who tried to invade syria the same man who will be locked up on the spot in several countries for war crimes namely drone bombing of innocent civilians I learned all about the history of south africa after I left school the anc was funded by the communist party that's why we are selling all our mines to China and russia the same reason we were the only country who bought Brazil's meat that was riddled with listeriosis which no other country would buy because they helped us in the struggle the age of conquest is over we are all free now we all have equal rights now I didnt inherent land I have to work for it and pay off my own property over a 15 year period like everyone else the reason south africa is so unequal is because the schools here in the suburbs work and the schools there in the kasi never see the tax payer money that is meant for them I dont live in sandton but many of my black friends I grew up with do you are trying to destroy a system that doesnt exist anymore by voting for and enabling corruption? figures systemic racism in south africa has a name it's called bee that's what systemic racism actually is government dont create jobs people who have jobs and pay taxes create government entrepreneurs create jobs I am now 27 and I have never experienced apartheid in my entire life yet I'm still paying for it that's the only injustice the only way to help our people is to stop corruption and make sure our rural and township schools get the proper funding to educate our people the only thing our government is teaching us is that corruption can be ignored if you convince people everything is racial I am speaking the truth it's not my fault you cant handle it you who calls everyone racist is just achieving the dilution of the word till it means nothing and losses its effectiveness you dont have the back bone to hear it you would rather tip toe through the tulips what lie am I living explain that's right you can't elaborate because you are mind numbingly thick us the rainbow nation the 10% who got to go to decent schools with the right amount of integration can talk about these things all day long because we arent stuck in a past we didnt experience disillusioned about this fact bigger then these two problems that I dont dispute is the victim mentality populism has given to people telling them to sit back because it's their turn to benefit that lie does alot of damage this government is populist tells people what they want to here madiba told people what they needed to hear so a lie is emboldened by people being unable to stomach the truth how pathetic is that perhaps its time to step cottling people so they will become strong which doesnt make much sense I know
Benny Malo,kapn My grandparents where killed during apartheid should i forget that. People who have never suffered tell us Blacks to move on that's pathetic "I don't hate white people Barack Obama is better than Trump Andrew MboweniâœŒ
