"My friend @lali Naidoo -Thieves dont have conscience As long as our justice system remains entangled in the political web we will never see any accountability "ACE is not worried he is plotting for bigger things  The point that DCJ is missing is that material suppliers were doing money laundering for ACE AND HIS CROONIES.

Cerebis,"Ace Magashule "This guy seems so happy Zwane? No that is not so @Bizana Ngesi I agree with you This guy did wrong in co operating and signing! I however feel sorry in some way for him as it must be tough and cold for him outside the ANC. They say that smiling and laughing a lot burns lots of calories. This must be why this witness is so slim and trim? Corruption is deep in the DNA of the ANC. They just cannot help being so. @Cobus Bester Maybe a Hospital tag to allow him a bed? Zwane is currently the chairperson of the parliamentary committee on transport.[ ANC national spokesperson Smuts Ngonyama in November 2004: “I did not join the struggle to be poor.” Jacob Zuma: The ANC more important than the Constitution. “No political force can destroy the ANC – it is only the ANC that can destroy itself… “[the Constitution is only there] to regulate matters.”

Wildthing,so many been paid to to do nothing or just steal.
Adrian Jones,free for all just given titles then deployed wherever just terrible orgaisation no wonder ANC itself is bankrupt and country is falling apart
Mashudu Tshitangano,when is arest? he need maximum protection
Pheladi Lamola,This Tsoametsi guy must come and clarify for us exactly what position he held in the FS govt 😲😲😲 He should've called Zwane's bluff. Obviously Zwane didn't have the balls to fire him Mr Mokoena didn't want to walk beside his shoes shem I feel like Mr Mokoena should've leaked all this info very early on to clip the wings of these corrupt people. Have it out in the open to force bo Zwane to take several seats The ANC is a lost cause.
William Pieters,go to jail for free. lol this is the biggest mistake of the ANC so far. I sorry... he does epitomize the ANC. thx for showing us the real colors of ANC. and again. lol lol Canis by mistake I mean this man can't lie. are the top 6 the most corrupt? please vote ANC again ZA. We might get lucky soon. #directelections must happen. he does do it Thabo. we are laughing at you already. is the ANC Black Excellence? I think the ANC have shown us what the NP was terrified of. Corruption of note. NP = National Party for peeps born after 1994 you go Thabo. we will be there to pick you up. bye guys
Thabo Mokoaleli,Mr. Mokoena is up to the task. He wants to show Mosebenzi Zwane and Ace one or two things 😂🤣🤷 Mr. Mokoena is using this space to hit back to Zwane. Mr. Mokoena is answering questions with gusto😂🤣🤷 Zwane was a Tsar of FS defended by Ace. Otlaba moputsoa. Mokoena is not holding back. He is determined to hit back at Zwane with whatever armament he has in his disposal 😂🤣🤷 Zwane was doing pick and choose 🤣😂🙈

Joan De Beer,"posts conflict and undermines the HOD It takes exceptional leadership and bravery to take a position like this to who does he complain? advice HOD's refuse to sign the documents send the advisor back to the messenger the MEC can take a report on suspension and for employee will be frustrated with huge legal costs to prove innocence eish legal..... the National dept and NT missed all of this. 5 year contracts and continuous restructuring cause this to happen
L Ll,Is this the whistle blower? POLITICS is not dangerous at all if done the right way! It’s the people involved in politics who are dangerous! 😡 Well ‘some’ of the people involved in politics are dang!

Molekoane Ranyaoa,It is easy to say that.
