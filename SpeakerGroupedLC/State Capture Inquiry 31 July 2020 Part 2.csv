Jacqui Baumgardt,more ducking and diving "as a judge @bongile sango agree @ Bev Judge Makhubelo
Caroline Hawanga,and here I was looking forward to Monday
Joe Debeer,:elbowcough:
Jenny Whitewaves,one really angry chair she has done her self no favours She was counting on the normal court procedure where it would have been struck off the rolls which would have given a long time before she had to appear If not there on Monday it is clearly contempt He is taking all her excuses for Monday away but clearly he wants to see her pretty face I think he is removing all charges that the evidence given was under duress if the things said here are to be used in criminal court Waiting for her to have a positive Covid If so I volunter to go and take the confirmation swabs She would have known she was booked to work in court days ago she could have picked up the phone to excuse herself I think they need Judge Judy Highest paid person on TV j I think there will only be the small fry in court They will be thrown under the bus by the real criminals Too much money to hire best lawyers and play in Staringrad Starlingrad A person who has been wrongly accused can't wait to tell their side but this ducking and diving shows some thing else If report not used even if changed no obstruction of justice so no reason to charge with defeating ends of justice So trial was set up to remove those making state capture difficult you can only say you did not mean to disrespect you can't say if others felt disrespected since it is evident several did please change you attitude
bongile sango,some witnesses the show no respect for this commission they show no respect @Roza that's what I've been preaching chair I don't understand why you soft like this @Mike Durban that's what she is doing laughing and having a glass of wine @Ann you rite Next is going to happen to all these they don't want to appear they going to say they afraid of Covid19. @Collen that is true is only my phone that got this funny noise? McBride really need to come here to clarify lot of things What I can say people are still going to be killed by police if things are still going to be like this @Lala Papa the noise is really annoying @Sal SA eNCA last time I check they were not broadcasting let me check again eNCA this noise is not sounding nice Still eNCA is off chair you seemed to be the one who is delaying the commission noise is off now trust me this witness is coming back monday chair must bring back all adv were here before because these one we got now their questioning mh mh is top notch @Skhathi I think that was him
xolani mzolo,she has ignored a direct order by DSJ and the commission DCJ
Pastor J.J,I am signing off on a Warrant of Arrest on this Thug Judge as we speak @Jenny. He is keeping the doors half open and I dont know why @Mike...totally agree "@Anne....and if she is cheeky @Roza...my bad Aunty "@Cplleen...we will make sure that he is in a critical condition if he tries to evade us again @Granny...Badly sadly. 2 that was returned to Zim was killed. @Bongile...no.its the audio @Aunty Roza......You tell him Tannie @Xhoi Xhoi....Please interact respectfully and take note of the rest of us....Or maybe you are on the wrong channel? @Xhoi Xhoi...Please man. Public or not dont disrespect 133 others on the chat. Go elsewhere if you feel the urge to disrespect 1341 @Herb...you are right @Xhoi Xhoi...It is a criminal offence to do that...@SABC News take note @Pieter...I have a new granddaughter and I have lots of disposed Diapers to give away. I have just reported his comments. @Xhio Xhoi...No one has defended anyone but simply trying to protect ourselves from an idiot....We have had enough of you One PK coming up. @Sal.....100% agreed "Whislt going to Xhoi @Anne...Enough for both. Can include a sister as well "Rendition/Extradition and a Sanctioned Arrest are 3 distinctly difference processes. The first is illegal and the f @Naledi...Thank you my friend @Pieter...If it is found to be Incorrect/Hearsay and or Unsubstantiated and so forth. @Pieter...Indeed so but not if it was simply a draft/working document "As we come to the end of this day I Pray and wish each of you and your Dear Families a Wonderful and Blessed evening and weekend. Go Safe

Colleen Arezio,Her delays are because she wants to get her lies in order. another postponement is bs. Zondo is too accommodating to these thugs. Have you noticed Zuma has not been sick or in Cuba recently? But when it's his turn to give evedience he'll be in critical condition. SA is not even my country but my heart bleeds for you. why not just blame the idiot that signed the extradition papers?!! his making alot of assumptions and as law goes that's wrong. Amen and same to you Pastor J.
Bev Daniels,@ Roza too true issues a warrant Contempt already "I am still waiting to see what her car looks like after the ""so-called"" accident she had"
Sal SA,Judge Maqobele is messing around with DCJ and the nation.Cannot continue Waste of taxpayers money ok thanks "He said Roza they all crooks and bleeding the country This oke is spinning big time It's not the first rendition and it won't be the last. Happening internationally He He's singing from the song book as Nhleko They should take this matter to court. The commission should proceed with corruption Thanks Dennis Noise is here too We need to move on from this evidence - DCJ and the nation has heard enough of this rendition issue. it seems like they were settling personal scores. He's an excellent spin doctor Is eNCA streaming Kwazi was Werkmens on the payroll DCJ let's have tea and move on Thanks Bongile please Thanks Bongile Mr July is using some facts and a lot of hearsay Madodana we are interpreting the evidence as citizens of SA and not involved in the system I'm blocking XhoiXhoi - to do so highlight the name and select ' Block' This is not the forum to settle political scores I agree Naledi Respect You mean cuteü§£ Did this rendition ever take place or was it a figment of someone's imagination? Where was it proven Mandla? We excuse you Ganesh USA also did extradition in SA many years ago by the CIA. I think it was in Ladysmith Says who Thanbo sorry Thabo Thabo if rendition is illegal how can they get state approval. Not allowed "Thabo Daily Maverick quote ""The Open Society Foundation found 136 people had gone through the process of ‚Äúextraordinary rendition‚Äù and 54 countries were complicit in it Pieter it happens in business environments same person
Bophelo Malapela,It‚Äôs judge Makhubela Maybe she is busy in court "He is here to justify why he recommended that McBride "Dramat left the police "The chair as the person in charge Lawyers make for frustrating witnesses July has nothing to be nervous about purpose of commission is not whether his report was right or wrong in its conclusions Yes he is representing July @Sal SA what hearsay when he conducted the investigation @bradley Petersen going to jail for what crime People expect this to be like an episode of law and order or some American legal drama. Legal proceedings are generally tedious & boring
Martha Wandrag,WTFlip!!!
Barbara Sattler,on Monday the lady is ill
Anne M.,@Barbara Sattler Or has another puncture An innocent person doesn't behave this way. "@Gina deW Then the team must send her a message via this chat @Pastor J On it. "@MIKE DURBAN Now that the amendment has been signed allowing the NPA access to the legal & investigative teams documents "Yup @Glorify Gumede Mr July is a lawyer from Werksmans Attorneys who were appointed to look into the rendition matter. "@Pastor J Looks like g o a t ' s brother is on the chat. Need to make a bigger fire "@Luvuyo Zantsi Nathi Mthethwa was Minister of Police when the rendition occurred. Nathi Nhleko appointed Werksmans and suspended Dramat My bad @Luvuyo Zantsi To you and yours as well @Pastor J
Code Geek,It is clear people do not know how to properly use the mask.
Gift gezani Masingi,I am disappointed with the way people would delay such things they are wasting our tax... cry my beloved country
Gina deW,"Watch closely @Bradley Petersen ü§£
dennis oldude,and when were you appointed as a judge? It will only be interesting if the DCJ puts his foot down and authorises an arrest warrant for her non appearance. This level of contempt on top of the indications of dishonesty she is mocking DCJ Circumstantial at best - what are you actually saying? Can't we arrange for something like this for the Guptas? Werksmans can defend them and cry for months but it will be great for the country if rendition is not an option - how about kidnapping H Sal - any attempt to take it to court will open the whole NPA Jiba can of worms again - based on this idiots opinion? so much noise covering up so much BS And I will continue to interpret the provisions of the act to support what I have said and done -th commission is wrong - Let me teach you how to think DCJ I know better than you
MIKE DURBAN,I'm really wonder about DCJ Zondo........reckon he's showing weakness....now the other accused will take advantage etc.... Gotto respect Judge Judy........tells it like it is hey..... If JZee is innocent.........then why he gotta worry.....makes you think hey....... Beginning to think if all this will ever reach the courts....i'm losing faith big time....... Shame .....Hulley is sick and tired of all this crap.....heheh @Anne M. ....Geeeez....i sure hope so......SA needs that....badly...... And if anybody says otherwise.......they bloody brainwashed.... Remember...McBride....the Bomber....... @Pastor J ......Yes......that's right.......and now he's a Big Boy in the ANC.........lovely Govt we have hey..... Bless everyone....and especially.......SA.......we need it badly............ Yahooo......Puza time........Cheers... Hey Guys.......Johnny Walker/Castle time.......relax dudes...... Yebo...........Bring on the Curry Bunnies as well......heheh "Lets start a movement.......""Jail For Capture"".....or something.........heheh"
wim louw,The commission has also developed a slow puncture
Madodana Tuntulwana,"Lets look at this sequence. Int & Nat laws violated "The commission is looking for answers Factual arguments always speak louder than noise. "Skilish I am so happy about your observation "Mr July is performing very excellent so far It would never be a hearsay when Mr July used interviews and wide range of investigative info at his disposal. "Ridiculing does not improve any argument Indeed the Commission is helping SA to know the factual side of things. We are now privy to information that has been distorted for years. Mr July so far has clearly indicated and identified wrongs committed "Violation of international laws "It is so informative to watch and listening to this testmony. It gives us the honest truth I hope Pieter you listening just listen "Pieter apologies Danie that is the exact picture we are unfortunately being given by the lead investigator.
Lydia Motloung,:yt:
Sthakathi Khumalo,"Interesting times Wandile Khowa It is very crucial indeed!! "But the guy is consistent in his story Lols Chair Mr Hulley and Zondo are miles apart in thinking Is that Ngcukayithobi.. Bophelo Malapela I could hear haha and thanks. "July is clear though Agree with you chair - strange technicalities.. There are these 3 dots that allows you to block BOTS!! I use it to my full advantage-there are some lonely souls searching for attention online But July has been clear in his articulation. People come to state capture to settle political scores like some have said and its true
Michael Holmes,wake up mr hulley Mcbride is a devil in sheeps clothing the whole of the state is corrupt comrades who are clean boys are the same people who helped disband the scorpions
Lee D. Hendrix,"...A postulation; SA will evolve into a model government @dennis oldude ...People won't corporate with the people of SA. ...ZONDO IS THE ONLY PERSON ACTING AS THE PEOPLE OF SA. The investigators are acting for the people of SA. @Roza essack ...Hulley wants to nail someone for arrest to come about. ...investigators earn point for performance. "...There is a certain protocol for administering Law and or Constitutional Law. At this point Sal SA...arrest is.... "..Sure "...To avoid testifying...move to Ethiopia "...Like a confession "...No official gives respect to the Constitution/people ...Gerda 7 ...TREASON is correct......
Felly,"This report is boring now
Granny Mokwena,I can't remember how this whole rendition saga ended. Any one with info?
skilash Skilash,The evidence leader is on McBride side. He is not here to assist the Chair. He has taken side already @Sal SA you are correct. This matter must be taken to court
Deep Cherry,"Guyz the real movie is coming on Monday when a judge takes the stand "@Phillip Cwazibe Judge Makhubele "This commission should get Adv Adila Hassim
mandla nkosi,"No sir. He is stating his case I agree with you Wandile 100% He is not justifying anything he is giving evidence on their investigation that's allüòäüòä I am starting to wonder if it is necessary for IPID to produce reports It seems like Judge Zondo has what he wanted from this witness The rendition took place and people died Yep that is why there was an investigation. The Police Portfolio Committee was asking questions to Nathi Mthethwa who was the Minister then No Sir Nathi Mthethwa. Rendition took place during Mthethwa's era Yes he was there because he commissioned an investigation by Welshman and he suspended Dramat and Mcbride but the rendition took place before him as Minister of Police sir @Luvuyo üëçüëç @Luvuyo. I agree with you
Glorify Gumede,sanibonani! bathini ? ubani owadla lemali? Who is this guy. he sounds believable highly prepared for this @Wandile Khowa thanks i joined now so i will try to follow This guy is clear @Sthakathi Khumalo true at first glance i thought this is Aaron Motswaledi Hon I'm not sure where Hulley is going with this but i'm not impressed so far july
Phillip Cwazibe,Deep Cherry who is the judge? On what matter.
Wandile Khowa,McBride is going to lose this new job The importance of hearing the other side of the story is so crucial @Glorify Gumede he is the director of the law firm that investigated IPIDs condcut "DCJ Zondo is experienced and intelligent Hence McBride all of the sudden asks for postpostments Commission has McBride and Jele's affidavits. Answers he is giving here are there. Comm had time to detect wrong things.
Gwyn Matthews,this guy gives irrelevant examples and talks too much he is trying to justify his useless report buddies of the exx police minister why would mcbride tell lies done so much in liberation the whole of the anc is we need new poltical party and electoral changes herman mashaba for president cross examine this clever man well said redeemer spot on waffles and waffles yes with strawberries and cream
Gerald Dlamini,Im totally lost.He is here to defend who and for what corruption? I miss Agrizzi and Mokonyanes Pitch. The Commision was moving

Naledi Barron,I did a ton of analytical work for the government back in the early 2000's. I'm in the U.K but would really like to direct my various reports to the appropriate H.O.Ds. Any suggestions guys? "@XhoiXhoi GrandSon. I defend your right to make your point. However "@XhoiXhoi GrandSon. Apologies @XhoiXhoi GrandSon. Now you are being facetious! C'mon! I'm being serious. "@Jonathan Ganesh. Please keep your preferences to yourself. Either add to the discourse Thank you Sal SA and Pastor J. Let's keep it civil and on point. @Jonathan Ganesh . No JG. I'm not. Can we get past the trolling nonsense and enjoy each other's decent comments please? @Jonathan Ganesh. Indeed! Definitely a breach in terms of a foreign force unless sanctioned at official level by SAPS.

Your levity has a laugh-by date. Again And before anybody thinks that S.A is the only government in trouble. Please think again - China is experiencing some serious Karma.

Nkululeko Njapha,@Madodana Tuntulwana To a point where people even ask if is the witness for or against Nhleko before listening to the witness. Mr July is clear it just that many have already made up their mind about who is guilty and who is innocents. If you touch the perceived angels irrespective of the facts you are labelled as a GUPTA. @Saneman If he wants to recline the chair so what? How does reclining the have to do with his evidence. @Lazarus Ramoba yes it is. @Saneman the chair really worries you. @Gugulethu Xhosans you have a problem
Saneman,too much word salad ..bottom line who did the crime he so wants to recline that chair His muzzle under the chin ..is that SA fashion thing I like it
Akhonamandla Gala,Mr July is a smart guy üòÇüòÇüòÇ October XhoiXhoi are you by any chance related to Andile Lungisa or Andile Mngxithama or both? time up!!
Abel Matshidiso,no Mr Chair it's not fair at all to put so much pressure on the evidence leader
Pieter Engelbrecht,question...how is any of this improving the lives of ordinary SA citizens? lots of talk...legal terms (which the majority of people do not understand). so they get the facts/evidence. what then? @Mangalani Mangalani Agreed. But it seems nowadays law means nothing really. mmm Sweating alcohol would be profitable now and a benefit @Saneman seems like it november @XhoiXhoi GrandSon yoh #facepalm thanks roza...i had a feeling i'm intelligent but now i know @Roza essack so true. but this is unfortunately the disease that social media brings. @Jonathan Ganesh diapers are expensive won't a towel suffice? one XhoiXhoi Grandson one PK? "no no @Roza essack country* commision of inquiry into XhoiXhoi Grandson's statement @Sal SA awe "wait heavens know...not another day XhoiXhoi just made me remember why i love drinking beer @Jonathan Ganesh lol We're here to help XhoiXhoi Help us help you how about we replace on bullet with one hug yoh during or after covid-19? Yup that's an option But i like to hear both sides...far left and far right #facepalm "K let's hear what the commission has to say @mandla nkosi yup July has a very interesting posture. lol like with any other country so...how dafuq do you get that right where is the law now gonna give someone a call and go there @Luvuyo Zantsi there are certain organizations that can operate in any country. #facepalm @Jonathan Ganesh you had enough hibiscus tea @Luvuyo Zantsi agreed. but we will never know. @Jonathan Ganesh that was my point earlier @thabo segonyonyo so how did USA order the execution of certain people in the middle east? wait...they used drones...nevermind @Madodana Tuntulwana but how do you know this is the truth? (especially in the US) the practice of sending a foreign criminal or terrorist suspect covertly to be interrogated in a country with less rigorous regulations for the humane treatment of prisoners. I'm interested to find out how many here are practicing law? what did i miss? How does a second report remove information from the first one? could someone please explain that to me "ok "@Pastor J thanks @Madodana Tuntulwana thank you for you honesty üôÇ i think i stayed because i find human behavior and interaction very interesting dude you have stickies on your pages...no need to guess the page number prima facie : accepted until proven otherwise for those that do not know thanks @Pastor J "@Jonathan Ganesh you're a silly dude and that's cool @Naledi Barron don't feed a troll. maybe a final question...who's funding this commision? "@Jonathan Ganesh one problem "retracting messages only hide them in chat wait.. so corruption whats the root of that? yes yes so if i have money and ask those corrupt to do something in order to push my agenda what do you think wil happen will* jarre bra you're like internet explorer wow..we went from inquiry to internet explorer to chi so back when did this commistion start? and it's still going right? taxpayer's money? or are they paying out of their own pockets to get to the truth of things? @Naledi Barron so true. "dude agree yup
Gugulethu Xhosans,@Herb Truck... i guess 30 June @Herb Tuck @Lazurus Ramoba thats your opinion Mr July is zoned hehe the knot has been untied. The report was to be used to legitimate the suspension of Anwat Dramat so that Ntlemeza can take over. """legitimize """ "The way Mr July is fighting to save his life in that commission
Mangalani Mangalani,@Pieter Engelbrecht This is critical for SA. We need rule of Law as foundation for this country. We need politicians/civil servants to understand they‚Äôll be held accountable for their action. @Pieter Engelbrencht But we shldnt give in.

Dr Luvuyo Zantsi,July is not a push over. Zimbabwe and South African police do have meetings together Policing in a foreign country must be unlawfull @Pieter Engelbrecht There is a difference between structures like Interpol and foreign country police. @mandla nkosi Nathi Nhleko not Mthethwa. General Sibiya recently won a labour court case for being fired because of this rendition case. @mandla nkosi Nathi Nhleko was in this commission last week and he was asked about this "@mandla nkosi Ok A lesson to be learnt is that we should not conclude on guilt after listening to only one witness without hearing the other side of the story. @Anne M. Thanks. I havealready conceded the point to @mandla nkosi Nothing bad @Anne M. You were assisting. Sandie July Sandile @Albert Noah You're welcome July clears Nhleko The allegation was that Nhleko appointed Werksman as a hit squad. That is being seriously challenged.
NathiTheGamer99,lol
Bill West,Are they discussing immigration charges or state capture? At this rate the issue of prosecuting the thieves will never conclude Jonathan you don't need a crystal ball to conclude that What has this trial have to doe with proving the guilt of the miscreants?
Mohamed Mia,Yes Jonathan agree with you . Waste of time and money
THABO Mosiane,only State Security can give permission for another foreign security to work in our country through the permission of the president and the minister of police @Sal SA. they got permission from the state security and they were accompanied by the minster of foreign affairs and the general of defence force @Sals SA. you can go back to that case and check. it was published remember after it happened. hence anything that happens out your borders gets published 14 after the mission.
Josh Leonard,Mr Hulley is trying to hard.

Leon Mbangwa,The head of Foreign Intelligence Services takes office sorounded by gross allegations of cross border crime. South Africa is not getting better We pray for Mr Mandilonga's soul. He died. Yes he did. @redeemed sinner Thus right. unfortunate that suspects of crime ran to the Commission and the evidence leaders failed to ask key questions. Now the commission evidence leaders are defending them @Daniel. Can't understand why McBride was even allowed to come and waste this Commission time. Hidden agendas at play @Daniel McBride will head Foreign Intelligence. I think the qualifying criteria for the position is how much have you lied without being caught. "DCJ you got to do something. Khuba lied to you. Sisoko lied to you The meaning of hit squad is misunderstood by certain people
Albert Noah,What's the full name of Mr. July? @Luvuyo Zantsi . thanks
