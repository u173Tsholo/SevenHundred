Pheladi Lamola,Ke sono ka ntate o shame. I was hoping he would enlighten me because I never knew that ANN7 got SABC archives. But now I'm failing to follow I'm trying to keep an open mind. English is not his mother tongue @Felix Muyoba
Felix Muyoba,honourable! no man..the guys is confused but the commission should also check which witness to call and not everybody @Siyabonga Dladla ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ but he is a white person "this @Lew464 has issues..if you are not a english person thats the truth..you dont know english thats why i said there was supposed to be an understudy for this guy
nhlanhla nkosi,the highlander Duncan macleod is back to slay the vampires
Lucky123 Thwala,this man is on drugs
Epnet Streaming,He is talking about video discs
azilo duwe,this witness is confused and Chair will be mad soon true..he knows all this thing about footages
Sophia Maholela,"Guys you are impatient
Yolo More,He is playing dumb. He is a crook. Remember he is the one who employed Hlaudi without matric. Anne he is the one who signed Hlaudi's appointment letter. He later becomes his boss. Go and check on YouTube for SACB hearings. He was testifying there. He understands English very well. This one is a crook. He is always like this when he feels the heat. He got something out of the deal.
TSATSI,i am now confused
Anne M.,@Yolo More He didn't employ Hlaudi. Hlaudi was his boss.
Muriel Haynes,i wonder how much he got well if it went to the guptas what do you expect
Maxwell Sibiya,@sthakathi Khumalo ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜Š This witness is on another level....ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ R100 or something per minutes? Wow
Siyabonga Dladla,Who is this guy looking like an old white woman here? I he understands english very well this guy I dont think he understands English very well this guy. I mean you can clearly see him trying to translate this into afrikaans before he speaks...that's why he always pauses before he speaks @Felix Muyoba Afrikaaners and coloreds struggle a lot with English "@Lew464 I said what I said "@Maxwell Sibiya I'm also confused hahahahaahaha now the Chair has to speak English like he's speaking to My Friend coz Frikkie here doesnt understand English
