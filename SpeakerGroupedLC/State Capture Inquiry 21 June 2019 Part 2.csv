PETER STAFFEN,what is happening
ELTA BOSHARD,"Commission resumes right after lunch break adjournment
funicanz,"The commission doesn't have that ""thing' on FRIDAY. I have been lost since they started and now that they are back "CFO at the Department of Community Safety and Transport "@Lex Luger 
Bernard Matolino,who is testifying? what was her role and where? just got released from real work not looting state coffers! thanks guys. so today its NW in the fray. this disease covered the whole country. no one is safe from this flu!!! corruption virus "@Margareth Waterboer You are so right!!! Cry the Beloved ""Cowntry""!!" @peter pott Never underestimate the intelligence of apartheid thugs. those guys were smart. You dont keep such a system running when you are daft @Thulani Bukani No. Terreblanche was just a later day buffoon. We are talking of architects here. "@peter pott It's not a language issue. When you are hiding something "SOMEONE Blessed🤣🤣🤣🤣😋😋😋😋 I am NOT Blessed🤗 But who is this van Wyk guy? But the Deputy Chief Justice is asking some tough questions that make this lady's story very shaky. How do you just sign coz you trust someone? Even if my wife were to bring me something I'd check it Guys you can't even trust your mother's daughter/son. Listen to the deputy chief justice's questions. This lady is not as naive as she is making out This lady is stammering now. Her story is not convincing. Under thorough cross examination she will fumble Thanks @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ I can never be as naive as this lady esp when doing business. She thinks she is so likeable van Wyk just liked her so much @Magda Seguin Just listen to the deputy chief justice. There is an experienced lawyer there. Not you and I This lady sees the trouble she is in and she decides let me make it van Wyk's story. It's pretty much like me trusting you guys. I don't know you. You could be killers. @goolamv you are right @Magda Seguin You misunderstand me. All I am saying is that it is imprudent to trust a stranger. Just like those ladies who hand their babies to strangers at taxi ranks and the strangers run. @Magda Seguin You are obviously not after unearthing truth but defending the witness. "@Magda Seguin I am worried why this lady did not see it. I also would not sign even what a colleague hands me A HUSTLER IS NEVER THIS NAIVE THIS HUSTLER HAS BEEN BUSTED She didnt even know how she was going to be paid. Easy picking for a half baked lawyer "@Derick Mampuru She is not confused @Magda Seguin Is she your connection? Were you also in the scam? They will arrest you!! "@Derick Mampuru Exactly @Magda Seguin Unfortunately I am illiterate. I can't read or write. Happy Now? Yes you won!! and supplied meat When you supp with the devil you must use a long fork. "@Mzalwane Mzala It is this belief "A blessee thinks she is so lucky A break at 6? What time are they adjourning? @Thando Nkutha I like this slender but would have loved Maleka or Hofmeyer @HERCULAAS KRUGER You are absolutely right. This judge's work ethic is absolutely wonderful. He was in parliament yesterday and he is making up for it today. Where are our parliamentarians today? @Danie Nilsen This lady would sell her soul and her grandmother's feet for a pound!!! @Magda Seguin There you go with your erudite platitudes @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ 😁😁😁😁😁 rhetoric
Anne M.,"Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Community Safety and Transport Ms Kutlwano Phatudi "@Kay Kay Of course @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ Don't say that around Adv Hofmeyr 😃 "@Thulani Bukani Yes Use the @SABC Digital News tag and ask them to sort it out. @peter pott Yes we do "If you can believe IOL @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ I thought you were also on a break because idiot's spam is still here. @Magda Seguin It can be quite depressing at times. I like to watch some Trevor Noah to lift my spirits. Go Pastor! "Yes "I wasn't able to listen to all of it last night Any damage at your place? Ms Tlatsana definitely does not want to be at the commission. @goolamv Where did you see that the commission is sitting tomorrow? "Okay @Kearabetswe Ntsane No such luck. He's supposed to attend 15 - 19 July @Diana Sekatane What's the alternative? @makhosi nobhatyi Who is going to get fired? @Tsepang Ranneileng Van Wyk is gay and his life partner is a man "No Hello@Thando Nkutha. Ms Babadi Tlatsana @Danie Nilsen Have you told the municipality (or whoever issued the work) that you were given sub-standard material to work with? "@Danie Nilsen Okay "@Danie Nilsen It might cost you some work in future He was General Manager Commercial at SA Express The agmt was envisaged to move R400 million out of North West gvnmt into SA Express and a third party that SA Express nominated to conduct ground-handling services at those airports named Koroneka. R97 million of that amount was paid out of the North West government and siphoned off through a “detailed scheme of money laundering” "@goolamv She had registered for a tender and Van Wyk needed a ""clean"" business to channel the money" "Yup @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ 😂 "I'm a night owl "Yup Storm weather and also snow
Pheladi Lamola,I can't hear a thing
peter pott,will western cape also come to light since bosasa is also have contracts there? "ah ah  This transcript is gonna be a mess. "eish Prof mokgoro anything bosasa must be brought under microscope he is the one who wrote this letter they discussing say comrade phatudi we got a very astute deputy chief justice here SA she is prepared. Only now before the judge she realise what a mess she got herself involved in "make no mistake "you are right apartheid is the system that in return could have resulted in huge death of a certain minority population . holding back from revolt by majority shouldn't be confused with stupidity This is an unfair question speak in setswana mama$😀😀ho thata fano "wait up until zuma speak in deep zulu "and like in Oscars case "example
Kay Kay,So Zuma want to play his delay tactics with the commission like he has been doing with the courts
Born free,Wow if we do any government work we only get paid a year later. In the private geotechnical Sector and this common practice kills the private Industry. I am aware of many small to medium businesses that have folded because Government takes forever to pay for services rendered. Yes just like a pack of Hyenas Infact they are Hyenas Yes I think she is contradicting herself as she states she knew there was something wrong with the Invoice but she paid it anyway. It was servicing Luthuli House They are gay lovers Yes Danie.. it would seem that corruption is the order of the day in S A. thanks Pastor 🙋 A witness rendered to Van Wyk as being very dark This witness looks familiar.. has she ever been a member of Parliament or in the government?? This witness is not as ignorant as she is making out to be. Is this witness a volunteer or was she supeoned?? I can understand why my luggage had been tampered with 🤤 @some guy... haha Insurance policy It's all fishy Trust leafs Trust leads to Betrayal R31 million The players are all connected. She is acting naive
Thulani Bukani,the rain preceding the cold front just landed in cape town. it's gonna be heavy rains tonight in the mother city @Lex Luger you should check a video of Louis Theroux interviewing Eugene Terreblanche. the guy was very very very far from smart or intelligent well said Peter
Bafana Mlangeni,Can someone in charge of sound please look into it...can’t hear anything.
Margareth Waterboer,"@ Peter Pott. I can't recall Western Cape involved in BOSASA corruption. BOSASA merely used or bought their Fencing company But the evidence never revealed corruption in this issue.. "I listened carefully The judge is the only bright mind in this part of the inquiry today.. Exactly @peter Pott.. GREED "Yep She's been poor every time she was leading.. She doesn't probe..only asks obvious questions as paperwork reveals.. Translators will be made available...Zondo said so time ago for any other language used at the commission.. As these things are always done.. "And I appreciate the streaming "I so much wanted to believe this lady "Sitting at home and getting millions ...nope Now she's rambling... "No And she can give banking details WHILE DRIVING! Judge Judy would say: now you're making it up as you go along.. "She doesn't look up now... No
makhosi nobhatyi,Lot of corruption here Difficult question to answer patudi R50 million must come back Supra Mahumapelo is implicated deeply @Goolamv wait we are still in the beginning He will be fired wait magda Seguin "@ Anne M Supra Mahumapelo
Diana Sekatane,from one corrupt comrades to another corrupt one. kuzoba lit. @Peter pott the inventers of apartheid were intelligent look at their beneficiaries they are well of. "this tender system must be abolished it is safe haven for a lot of corruption government companies because people don't have jobs. "Greed knows no gender You can't win something that is not in a competition. the lady was used as very badly.
Norman Zwane,"I think you'll all be deeply offended that we past the stage of even trying to find anyone clean within the ANC. I suggest it's like any brotherhood "With respect to anyone in the ANC or with family in there @Derek Main It's like looking into the heart of darkness and trying too find a virgin in a brothel "As a constitutional democracy we must waste time and money to give crooks an opportunity to defend themselves @nhlanhla nkosi Kwavele kwashuba @Derek Main From your mouth to the mouth of the gods! Line them all up & Fire!!! @Born free You kill me. The most truth is told in jest. "@peter pott You may be right about the qualification @Mduduzi Thabede To the greater world these peeps tend to be the standard for how the rest of our kids are judged. I am sorry that she is so slow but how did she get ahead of better kids? @Tsepang Ranneileng You get the kind of lawyer you pay for. That was a mistake ????? "@Khaya Nomoyi Like I said
Derek Main,Yes - corrupt to the core The ANC cadres are as thick as thieves. All in it together. It's something that was known by most thinking SAfns long before this commission. Only the ANC voters couldn't see it. @Hannes Prinsloo If the ANC cadres don't manage to steal it first. @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ .. and politicians. 🤣 @Anne M. Nope - don't believe a word IOL says - Iqbal has an agenda. Whatever happened to lifestyle audits for public officials? @Anne M. Yes - that's what's supposed to happen but we all know it doesn't. They get away with a slap on the wrist if caught out. Audits would lay bare the fact that they must be corrupt.
Sj Kk,Corruption exist
nhlanhla nkosi,ayeye
Khaya Nomoyi,She is hiding something.Maybe I am wrong. This advocate is soft with her thats why the chair keeps on interupting to get clarity.This witness will be bad under cross-examination. Tsepang you are right.Something is not right with her performance. "There it is "Zwane These witnesses sometimes they are really moving this commission at a snail pace. She should have been given her affidavit first to refresh her memory. Seguin they do consult with the evidence leaders to refresh their memory before the start of the proceedings She could have handed Corineca over to Van Wyk. It seems like she was being pushed under pressure and the cotract was lucrative. My worry is that she is not given protection when she talks about lift home.
Mduduzi Thabede,The DCJ has sharp brains... for lack of a better word That’s harsh Norman... But I agree 😀 She always start slow but I guess it’s because her witness is not up to the task I guess... "Norman I’m with you Where have you heard of exco i.e political heads taking a a decision or recommendations as to whom a tender must be awarded...
Tsepang R,"To be brutally honest massive downgrade from Hofmeyr so I disagree @Norman Zwane. Its got nothing to do with money. How did she even make it to the team typical tenderpreneur life partner?? I'm confused.. "GREED! The hallmark of all tenderpreneurs! She was just interested in making easy money GREED leads us into scams! typical tenderpreneur. just signs documents and waits for easy ANC millions Ms Hofmeyr is the epitome of reason and articulation😍
Hannes Prinsloo,the corrupt peoples lawyers gonna take all the lootet money then nothing left of tax payers money
ziyanda cele,does this lady have any info boaring its like she is scared
M aXe,ayeye this seat is hot!!!!
Pitso Mosetlhe,Supra must also come to the commission
carnoth ngomane,@makhosi nobhatyi soon he will be talking to the media before they even ask him to come and testify @goolamv there's no smoke without fire @Mzalwane Mzala i get you but its usually the case
Magda Seguin,Is anyone also suffering from Commission fatigue? "I stopped commenting a long time ago I see my buddies are here all the time too "I watch animal videos @Anne.M what do you think of SONA? We had a 5 plus earthquake here in Western France "No These ladies are colour coded! Thank you Pastor JJ Pastor JJ 🙏 "I really feel for the DCJ and his team @Anne M its obvious Som people despise Afrikaans but still use it everyday Lesufi is leading the pack against Afrikaans He is a racist "Racism will be the downfall of SA ANC and EFF...divide and rule While most of the Zuma/Gupta acolytes are still in the SOEs they will cause havoc together with the Unions.CR didn't even mention disbundling of Eskom in his SONA as he previously promised He buckled under pressure from the Unions to appease the Zuma faction in parliament Zuma was at court supporting his son in Bloem yesterday It was deferred to Sept I think Foes this lady have lawyers? She seems not to understand a contract *does Buy documents It was rebutted by other experts "Red flag One can easily access government tenders on their website and the relevant email info to send it to "Supra is one of the Premier Team with Ace @Ben Cole totally correct She specifically mentioned Supra...listen Supra is now a chairman of a parliamentary committee "Mark my words *going Shortlisted maybe but judging that Frolivk is also there among others tells you that they are regrouping If you see what Supra did in the NW your hair will stand on end...the health infrastructure is totally destroyed...that's just one example The defunct Gupta health mobile unit that did zilch comes to mind The entire world can see that the SA population is paralysed by corrupt politicians @goolamv...check out the Gupta health mobile unit story for starters Or read up investigative publications of the premier league "I know the inside story remember I worked closely with the NDOH There is also the new ambulances that never went on the road while people had no services... NW was put on administration Zuma still has all his allies firmly in place including the PP "I think when the prosecutions start SAs will be so traumatised "They say SAs must become entrepreneurs but they get sucked in by corrupt politicians What a mafia style invasion of her CC "Nepotism This breaks my heart @Ben Cole maybe he thought this will never be revealed @Victor it's called corruption The DCJ must get everything on the table as it will go on record for the courts...a snails pace is better to get the details than to rush and they go to court unprepared "I picked it up immediately SA Express was grounded due to all the mismanagement "SAA and SA Express must be sold "Normally all witnesses have their a copy of their affadavits "The mafia uses coercion "She trusted government and parastatal officials When this ho yo court any judge worth their salt will see right through the Ban Wyk coercion tactics "Skin colour doesn't matter "This lady was naive "Eish "I dont think so Bicyor @Victor It was a CC!! for goodness sake it was a catering company!! Always rushing....there you have a strategy of coercion right there @Victor...she was used and abused "@Victor this is how criminals work *Ponzi schemes Van Wyk inserted himself into her business and directed everything That is not how tenders work Van Wyk was from SA Express You are right @Anne M his name was mentioned with the grounding of SA Express Read my lips @Lex Luger criminals go for the vulnerable and those who are not aware of their rights.According to her he was in authority and she believed and trusted him implicitly "Read between the lines He is an effing criminal I am getting so angry now @Lex Luger you need to learn discernment and analytical skills rather than criticising the witness Any fool can hear that this lady was conned The DCJ must ask pertinent questions to protect her when it goes to court @Lex Luger you dont know my background.Sit down Exactly it's a monumental scam @Lex Luger it's your perogative but dont make assumptions on who we are "I work with people everyday of my life in their most intimate lives "These tenders are usually millions I am impartial but I can see a scam a mile away "Some people in SA always defends corruption Semantics @Lex Luger Whatever @Lex Luger Who knows whether she recieved the millions? Why is she here? "This needs to be put in context Arrest me? Dont patronise me "@Anne M your friend @Lex Luger needs to read and be informed about this commission and why it exists That R400m was stolen She is what is called a 'patsy' the fall guy for malicious purposes "From the start of this commission it is very clear how peoples lives were destroyed by the Zuptoids they had a specific strategy.People used If you are not on the side of justice you are complicit
Keith Hadden,Are we done for today?
Bongani Sondlo,dumelang.. "Ke gone ke gorogang this is koroneka.. her self..
Mzalwane Mzala,This is getting complicated It's getting messy She is a professional We need to follow the evidence and not speed before it. Brian Tebogo Van Wyk has been heavily implicated by more than one witness so far. @carnoth ngomane I stopped using that saying after I experienced being a victing of a story that was manufactured about me. Victim Exactly I supported PP Madonsela and I give the same support to PP Mkhwebane. The review process is a sound one. No chair Zondo is precise @Some guy 😁😁 I think she is the original owner of Koroneka @Thando Nkutha It doesn't seem like she was a sophisticated business person as she applied for small tenders with only one or two people assisting as employees. the township kind thing Van Wyk saw an opportunity to use a person who have a registered business that did not really have work. Even the big tender was suggested by Mr Van Wyk. There are many registered businesses out there by people who had dreams but could not get work. I want to listen to her recordings of Van Wyk Please trust your wife @Lex Luger Her only experience is as a subcontractor in delivering meat. Did she ever get a construction tender? Indlala I don't think she ever won a big tender like construction. She had two companies what were tendering for government contracts Kunjalo Thando Vuka mawulele @Zola Pinda That is exactly the issue @Lex Luger I get you. Many people who work in government find themselves in such relationships. Check how JZ operated: Give a senior job to a person who will know that they would have never got it without your intervention. Such a person agrees to everything you say This lady knew that she owed Van Wyk for that contract and could not question him. @Thando Nkutha I don't think she was consciously being criminal but she let go of ethics in order to get the big money. Unfortunately for her she was dealing with a bigger tsotsi. She was used and she allowed herself to be used. Lesson: Always follow processes. Short cuts are dangerous. You're a big boss now! African women are being used in these contracts. @Some guy Ngubani othe uyasazi isiXhosa lomama? Umama was just happy to receive the money Definition of fronting! truth is coming out She was captured by Brian Tebogo van Wyk I also understand her situation She was a white man I also won a case at work for a guy who was disciplined for being overheard saying mlungu. This case is opening eyes about one other form of corruption by senior managers. is it not seven in SA yet? I thought they were going to stop at 19h00. It is 18h04 here So they are not making a mistake about Saturday Zondo means business now
Wilson Hishono,I like the way how this lady is leading the proceedings ...no blunders unlike the previous...shes has done her home work very well somehow shes grilling them

P T,This is amusing stuff so a defunct company with 3 employees amd zero experience except delivering meat is given a tender to facilitate immigration and transit administration of passengers
Ben Cole,Koroneka will show state capture and mafia style gangsterism in action. Stealing by stealth a law abiding citizen's business to give it to the political gangsters. I like this witness. Painful to see how she was set up and how her dreams were usurped by crooks. So am I enjoying this witness. One of the few who brings laughter by an otherwise somber affair. "Van Wyk The crookery and deceit goes beyond any bounds of reason. Naitivity and blind trust in people of authority at any level had got us where we are today.
Bongie Bubble,She is much smarter then this its all part of her plan just to be on the safe side. A gmail account ? lame explanation by her so called business associate. Tender tendencies Indeed Supra had been mentioned

Zola Pinda,The contract is more than R 400m She can Bank the millions in her account but can’t read the contract. I think she playing games. She is trying to avoid jail. She’s lying😂😂 She said she’s done construction tenders for government before. Yes🤣🤣 She had a drive and van loader for her meat delivery in hospitals later end up with close a half a billion. Pathetic Yes R400m no contract 😣😣 This is very sad for us as tax payers. These looters must go rot in jail 😀😀 Very clever To loot R 8m in 2 weeks after signing the contract. This woman is not a baby.

Kevin Simon,"Her business was identified Contracts equal money for nothing. The only reason she agreed is because this system worked before. "With all this going on Seems information is all she lacked. She is effectively pleading guilty to money laundering. RET at its best!!!! "Wait for it Relax "As long as there was some funds left for her for doing nothing CEO for rent Declared as divend. No divend witholding tax company to company.
