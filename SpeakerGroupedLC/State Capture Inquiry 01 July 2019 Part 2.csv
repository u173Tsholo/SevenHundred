Ndimphiwe Gushu,I hope the technical issues are fixed on Part 2. Last session was filled with glitches & blackouts. Come on SABC. How do you know it's a dress? @Wilhelm5381
SHAFIQUE KHAN,. .. . . .
Wilhelm5381,lovely dress she's wearing...
Dominic Przybylski,Nice to see someone who appears to be competent. The abuse of BEE seems to follow a standard pattern. "Nothing wrong with tendering. The problem is the people who use it in combination with ignorant ""beneficiaries"" who are confounded and manipulated." Tender is standard procedure for all large contracts private or public sector. It is way to obtain quotes. Without tenders there can be no quotes. The problem is the PEOPLE who adjudicate """Radical Transformation"" is the excuse for corruption." All SOE procurement is politically skewed. "Government has run out of money and doesn't pay on time anyway so who wants to do business with them @Kapn Krunch That's the gist of it. Lot of skeletons in Ramaphosa's closet. How did he become a billionaire simply by being a token BEE non-executive board member in a bunch of companies? "PP vs CR is likely to be very interesting Leader of evidence is annoying. Is she a qualified lawyer? @makhosi nobhatyi Depends whether money laundering is involved and the extent of it. @makhosi nobhatyi I hope so. If CR is proved to be a crook we are in huge trouble. "Zuma appointed Myeni @Born free "@makhosi nobhatyi regardless of faction if the evidence of fraud Cadre deployment and BEE has virtually guaranteed that anyone involved will have acted without integrity. SAA is a scary airline. Problem with JZ is he doesn't understand difference between corruption and integrity. @Francois Cape Town this is not a training ground. Has Meyer appeared before the commission yet? @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU That's because she is not a looter. Zondo has to take over from Buthelezi. @Kevin Allister Simon That's the pattern in BEE - give contract to clueless token then launder the money into their own accounts. To count 10 billion at R1 per second will take 360 years. Wow! No wonder we have such competent employees in SOEs.[not] "Carl Niehaus ""stepped down as ANC spokesman in February 2009 after admitting to maladministration of his own finances @Michael Wild exactly. They get 30% of revenue without having to do any of the work. I know my dad's architectural firm had to pay 40% to black partners who did nothing in order to get government work. Economy can't survive My hope is that BEE is proved to be a vehicle for corruption and state failure by this commission and that it will be scrapped. @Magda Seguin I'm retired now but had to leave the country to continue with my career in IT. @Magda Seguin Cannot find anything in the last week on youtube but did read article in Daily Maverick on Friday where she says NPA is in much worse shape than she had imagined. @Born free BEE and AA destroyed the whole SA IT industry because there were not enough qualified blacks to fill the quotas. We were world leaders in IT before BEE. People like Zondo and Miss Mpshe prove that BEE and AA are not necessary. If competent people of any colour are allowed to operate unhindered they will uplift the country. @Marshall Cheri counter-kleptocracy revolutionaries. This spammer is active throughout youtube. Is on Wimbledon live too. SAA to rely on small township and rural businesses - scary. @Norman Zwane Very attractive woman. 61 30% even if they do nothing. She gives much better evidence than the doctor. Now I understand what radical transformation means: It means that government should act without any regard for the law. Only 1361 people watching out of a population of 60 million. My point is that it is only a politically insignificant minority who will have been exposed to this evidence. So effectively Kwinane as owner of the company would be getting the 30% and then deciding how much she'll give to the members of her consortium. Pure conflict of interest. This like mafia. @Yolo More Our countrymen consider the respect for competence irrespective of gender and race as racist. It's the basis for BEE and AA. Heh! There are very few people who don't spell my name wrong :) @roberto wilco Ethics are a sin to corrupt people. "@Gareth Davies I did a three month contract at Rossing "Ah okay. I don't know any Przybylskis outside of my immediate family Thuli cannot be bullied. "Apart from state capture True. Karl Marx didn't forsee the establishment of unions. There were no unions in USSR. and did nothing to help union members at Marikana. What chances for turnaround strategies and new boards and expensive new CEOs to actually succeed? I don't think anybody can turn SOEs around within the current political context. The competent ethical people regardless of colour are all kicked out to allow for looting. As far as I know Jarana had no aviation experience. This government has lost all legitimacy. Full respect to Thuli Mpshe. This leaves me so angry. Great South Africans in a rubbish South Africa. Trump was right. This is a shithole country. How do we fix this? We need to change an entire culture. It's almost impossible. Individual instead of collective responsibility is the key.
Born free,It appears that Mama Dudu Myeni exceeded her fiduciary duties and was running SAA. Sky Chefs will win their law suit but it should be Myeni that's pays them from her very own purse. This witness is an honourable educated lady. Myeni certainly had all the loyalists removed. Tenders should not fall into the hands of the ANC "Yes the Tenders should be procured by qualified people who are not affiliated to any party. Bring back the death penalty The government can carry on with transformation in the government but must leave the private sector alone. This government has destroyed many private companies and small to medium businesses Where did Ramaphosa acquire the money to Invest in mining and buy all the McDonald Franchises?? It's interesting to learn that Madam Myeni was also the Chairperson of Fly Chefs . Where she would have profited no doubt. SAA made a fundamental error appointing Madam Myeni Yes thanks @Dominique.. I was wondering about that. Has the Government had to bail out SAA almost every year since Myeni was appointed?? So they could not have had their first gets on the pulse.. we know why now. Zuma will have to answer questions and not pick and choose. Judge Zondo will ensure this. "Zuma is no longer the President It's just that Ms Buthelezi does have this cry in her voice.. 🤣 Sometimes when Ms Buthelezi asks a question it is as if she is going to start crying 😂 Yes.. that she is. But Agrizzi was recorded in his own home and that recording should not have been admissible in this enquiry or a court. This witness is credible and ethical. That weave hair or bun on top of Ms Buthelezi's head.. looks very heavy Top heavy That doesn't sound right.. not made into law then it is unlawful. Zuma dumbest President ever This 30%set aside whatever it is.. is invalid and should nullify any contracts. Like yesterday I employ on skill and qualifications not into BEE. The CA and Myeni must go down together. I employ skilled qualified people I don't need the government for business and it won't dictate to me. BEE destroyed many businesses that employed many blacks. Group Five and many other engineering firms and other companies. BEE did not create jobs it lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. I ain't going anywhere.. my ancestors were here before the Zulus and Bantu. It's about the violence in this country I stand on a point of Order.. what do you you mean Order? What is your point of ORDER honourable member?
Derek Main,@Dominic Przybylski #ProudlyBroughtToYouByTheANC @Disemi Molta I agree it's flawed but what's the alternative. I think we need to get much tougher on corruption. Something to really put off the thieves - like the Chinese model of execution for corruption. "I'm not really a fan of the death penalty but for corruption @Born free That's not a bad idea - an independent company deciding on all government tenders so there can be no conflicts of interest. @Disemi Molta Tend to agree with you. Just look at the farce of an Arms Deal inquiry. It would be funny if it weren't so sad. Disemi - I'm with you all the way on that one but Zupta is a wily fox. My cynical side says he will get away with it. Either he will claim unfair it's taken so long or old age. @Pastor JJ I think these are discussions that need to be had. There are few other areas where we SAfns can engage. @Pastor JJ I would argue they are largely essential debates. I like hearing the views of other SAfns of the issues confronting us. "@Pastor JJ You know where the block button is - if you don't like seeing what I'm saying @Pastor JJ Like I said - block me. @Disemi Molta I think JZ will find some excuse not to testify. @Thando Nkutha I don't dispute he will go to commission but his lawyer will do all the talking. He'll find a way not to testify. @Pastor JJ No problem. I'll try to stick to the script but it's difficult. 😎 @Dominic Przybylski JZ wouldn't know integrity if it jumped up and slapped him in the face. Very impressive witness. Let's see the accused try to cross-examine her. "@Mark Kidd He'll say ""Apartheid made me do it.""" BEE is just a vehicle for corruption. "@Dominic Przybylski That's my hope too. BEE is corruption on steroids. However "@tony bren To be honest @tony bren What do you suggest? "@tony bren ""You guys..."" So you're not from SA?" "@tony bren If not @Siya Dilimeni What if I'm not honourable? 😊 "@Siya Dilimeni ""PAY BACK THE MONEY!""" 😂 Dudu Myeni reminds me of Grace Mugabe.
Disemi Molta,tendering should be abolished hiring more youth the better "tendering has lot of loopholes which create room for corruption. it was meant to uplift the poor of the poorest "but the ruling party is not considerate of those qualified people once and for all more money which was supposed to create job is channeled to commissions after commission with no prosecution what is the role of vetting then? of course centralise tender process rather "more money is wasted on investigations and investigations "Derek "one issue brings other issues true from the 9-15 is zuma Malema reprimanded SA in 2011 about the Guptas and the apoointment of ministers 15 to 19 july "but he must be treated like others there is no way zuma can duck all the evidence that is pointing to him maybe at the end we can have a clean governance I suspect so and must be trated as such "If Zuma is not careful enough Nkandla will be forfeited by the state
Joyful Technologies,"I totally agree with you
Ibo Thabo,@Disemi Molta Thank you so much since Zuma hijacked the country via hijacking the ANC nearly everyone particularly his followers feel bold to copy him With all of these chaos & shambolic in such very important not just organ but symbol of the nation where was the NIA to alarm & advice the government and parliament? How can all of this happened for years now and no any arrest and persecution for this blatant stupidity?
KQ-O’ American Lady,This was already on? Not live Oh really What a lovely blazer I knew someone who said there was an African buying up cars to ship to africa. This was in mid 2000’s Interesting she said that. See her infinity symbol on her blazer? is that a pin? or pattern? I wonder how she acts when cameras off? The True self always gets revealed Head of Human Resources is a very important job. They need to be a moral honorable and Not Bias at all @Keith What? Only a spy mentality would think that way. If i’m wrong about your question My apology 🤝 BTW an open free society right? This is on Youtube Exactly No Collusion @KEITH 👍 😂 MK veterans I see I like this woman. Very wise it seems. Well educated Are those Black owned company qualified? Or just because they are black only? That’s bias in my very humble opinion. When only for skin color or female only is the wrong way for success
Magda Seguin,No sound SABC Digital sound please Zuma mentioning names? No sane person will believe a word he says 15th to 19th July "I took that plane twice from and to Dakar in Senegal "The last time I went to Abidjan in Ivory Coast I took the SAA flight via Accra I dint fly SAA anymore "I read that people are collecting money for Zuma supporters are coming to the commission They even asked taxi associations to lower their fares for his supporters to attend "@Kay Kay he is a discredited ANC cadre "@Kay Kay Yes "When she said this morning that Dudu Miyeni said about Bosque that ""we will find something to get rid of him"" I knew this witness was on a roll" @Kay Kay remember they wanted NDZ to be president? Take a guess why "I think Dudu Miyeni only has a Senior Education diploma  A third of the GDP: R1.4 trillion It could even be more looted judging by the new AG Report that only 18 out of 297 municipalities had clean audits The two she mentioned are also implicated WoW!! policies and procedures are not important Des Van Rooyen was a backbencher in parliament when Zula appointed him Minister of Finance Well said @Kevin Allister Simon "I saw those veterans at the Zuma meeting with the ANCYL at UJ a few days ago "Also looks that the BEEE was cooked "@Kay Kay His speech as IJ can be considered inciting a revolt "I dont think so @Siya Dilimeni @Dominic so many businesses people are immigrating due to BEE @Kevin Allister Simon just search for NPA in the search bar "I have hope that SA will get on its feet again but I am so scared of the endemic violence "Both the women at the NPA have flawless credentials "So @ Yony Bren I must be a sitting duck to be raped and killed "We all have choices "I can walk safely here at night @Tony bren do you even know me to make such a statement? Just last night a couple was killed in their own home in the EC "Ok we are cowards Yep @Anne M @Siya Dilimeni 😊 Yes Chair "It looks like he is a troll "My heart is in SA Point of order Chair...according to troll rule number 3 we are happy that the troll is gone The spammers are on steroids today The DCJ has one of the most analytical minds I came across Is Swissport not an ACSA sub contractor or am I confused? Thanks Dudu Miyeni is really a nasty somebody You mean involved romantically? Thuli has a white fiancee I saw their engagement photo online I'm happy that she has a companion These people were very dramatic in their looting "She is relating how it happened True @Gareth Davies they had no decorum or integrity A Board Chairman who should not be involved day to day running if the company is shunting a CEO around @Gareth Davies☺ Drama par excellence I am sure filmmakers will make doccies "Not just SAA "Bullying in the workplace is rife in SA "Spot on Dominic 😂😂😂😂 "Very sad "Tense is not the word Sometimes I watch the commission videos later on YT that I couldn't watch in full The paper trail font lie "It's the first time I see her so slow Amen Exactly @Anne M they cant stand women with integrity and morals The corrupt ones @mxolosi buthelezi...need I spell it out? "Semantics @rosalind gerber what are you referring to? "I see the scales  Thanks @rosalind gerber Definitely @rosalind gerber 🤗 "SA maize forecast is bad "The Unions are implicated in state capture as well The tripartite alliance is the worst thing that happened to SA Yes absolutely @Gareth Davies Exactly what happened @MIKE LOCK Communism is dream sold to the poor while the oligarchs live large "Yes look what a magnificent billionaire the previous union leader @MIKE LOCK there us a real strategy in keeping people uneducated hence the 30% pass rate "Miyeno was being obstructionist in dealing with the witness What???. "Miyeni had no guts to face Thuli All against BCEA Could have been @ Raymond Fitzgerald...the SOE looters were always acting in accordance with Zuma and Gupta orders "Legalitiespolicies and procedures out the window And so institutional knowledge was cast aside to make way for theft Hand picking the pliable candidates Vast difference Job descriptions of an auditor and CFO is a world apart Leaked "Totally "Gavin Watson was in cahoots with 'black excellence' And a 'collective' "When people told me at the dawn of democracy in SA that liberation movements are never successful at government What a dynamic leader "@Anne M News24 is the most trusted news in SA "SA is a poster child in the world for abject poverty "The Gini coefficient is 0.64 I look at all media including credible international media but remain discerning Its everywhere @clive oconnell but other countries have not been pillaged like SA except Zim and Venezuela Kalandra Viljoen was found to be complicit in money laundering @Jayden Bango🤣 Zuma said the ANC will rule until Jesus comes @Anne M he is talking about the documents that disappeared of Thuli she gave to investigators she went through a heck of a lot Incompetence!! "He had to finally admit that he is not the silver bullet that could turn SAA around I think Jarana was also influenced by the rotten apples that is still on the Board In fact that is what he said in essence in his press release for his reason for resigning UetvZumas legal fees are still being paid...terrible! *Yet "Death threats No he didn't @Dominic This advocate looks ill Dudu must go to jail She left under duress The Guptas are living large on SA taxpayers money and left a path of destruction in SA.I really want Gigaba to answe for his treason "By standing up together and saying not in our name I am serious "I feel her pain We can start a YouTube channel to start with inviting all SAs and the diaspora and have people on the ground in communities to advocate for peace and love
Robert Russell,@Derek Main .... there is a wealth of retired acumen in our society.... run pre-awarded tenders past them to see if there is value for money..... before the final awards
Kapn Krunch,they will never leave the private sector alone without us they have no money they are communists they dont understand business they just want its money look at ramaphosa a supposed business man announcing land expropriation without compensation with no plan on how they will do it giving investors cold feet the man doesn't understand business if he did he wouldn't have done it like that am I wrong? what sort of business man does such a thing he didnt even reassure them and as a result we hit junk status shortly after cause and affect was just saying
gavin dw,It seems like this miss quinana has some questions to answer
Thami Ngwenya,China is a communist country and no2 in the world monopoly "Money laundering does not form part of PP. iT IS A SEROUS CRIME
Bernard Matolino,@Kapn Krunch You are misrepresenting Cyril Ramaphosa for your own propagandistic end @Pastor JJ You are right. It is wrong to misrepresent a President @LYD online tv Hallo friend @Jayden Bango Is that Kwinana coming to testify? @Noluthando Gosa 😂😂😂😂😂😂 @Yolo More It is like rumor mongering The judge must not listen to this with such keen interest. It is really like he is over enjoying it "@Dominic Przybylski thers are watching on TV "@Yolo More This is one sided Every witness will tell the story to suit his or her side. Until they are cross-examined.

Cerebis,CR was no 2 in the ANC Collective.....All ANC office bearers are on trail in this commision I have seen many very compitent black women lately. Why are they not in the cabinet President? Agree! This lady ans sizwe of SAA springs to mind on this committee list Maybe it is time for Judge Zondo to attach a trauma counselor to his team? They just cannot be left unaffected by all this evil corruption and crime. Last days are indeed upon us! @mxolisi buthelezi After taking over the new aircraft....lol
Wilson Hishono,this leader of evidence also ...seems to be in need of guidance too if it was Ms hofmeyer shes just sharp ukuthi... this one is not applying any analysis Ms Myeni is a mastermind or KINGPIN or architect with no signature ... Shes not guilty because she did not sign any thing and everything at this point are but just allegations

Black agenda i see here she thought he was white haha The radical economic transformers (the problem with zuma and his people was that they sought corrupt ways to introduce radical economic transformation. It only benefited them.. mxm) This one was sanctioned because she went with the white cabal at SAA "No one must go anywhere Miss Hoffmeyer must relax... We need to give other young colleagues a chance! Ya`ll act like you were born experts mxm Kanti when is Mcebisi Jonas coming back???

"How many of you felt for Jiba on the Mkgoro commission
Kevin Simon,They practiced with BNP and Koroneka then scaled it up. RET! Then they needed idiots in positions. QED. State Capture had become State Policy. Get Carl Niehaus in as well. Magda. send utube link please. This was Zuma looting SOEs in order to pay off supporters under the guise of BEE. Set up these contracts to be annuity income. The ultimate would have been the nuclear deal. If Kwinana and Duds have any honour they would insist on appearing at this commission. Not holding my breath though 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😎 Hoo hooo there are emails😊. Said. Nhantsi was parachuted in onto a burning platform. Perfect candidate. Qualified yet lacking experience. Easily manipulated. Rubber stamped what she was told to. Language issue only. She knows she's been abused. What this commission is demonstrating is Black excellence as well as Black malfeasance. Interesting contrast.
Ambani Muilambudzi,😞😞

Khaya Nomoyi,Hey Ms Myeni was at another level and no one could stop her.I wonder whether they have ever read the King's report on governance. Thanks Mrs Mpshe for being brave and standing to the incompetent corrupt board members.
Wildthing,dont need BEE with people like her it is really sad how they changed the process to benefit themselves and in the background they where pushing the race hate to hide it arrests need to happen soon because the longer they wait the more is stolen or evediance hidden. ha ha when she looks straight ahead the scales look like earnings Unions should be closed to save SA unions must go fast. They tried to downgrade her at work and no Union members so Unions are only used when they needed. true she should be reinstated as CEO

Gareth Davies,@clive O’Connell that BNP guy was a total idiot. Did you watch his display at the close when he was pleading that what he’d done was in the interest of black people. "@ Magda Swquin 👍@ Yolo More. 😭my heart went out to Dr Dawa last Friday when he related how he’d lost his house and his inability to gain useful employment. "@Magda Sequin You expect? "@Magda Sequin In the horror category @ Moahi Hlapolos. "@Raymond Fitzgerald I agree @ Noluthhando Gosa. Mahlangu is a 💩 who could not remember his lies. @Dominic Przybylski.

Simisani Moyo,can someone please make a drama series on this!!
Moahi Hlapolosa,Someone should make a movie out of the state capture. It will win an Oscar These people were so complacent “ ....will his mind” I’ve heard that before The president is applying his mind SAA is a mess. She was trying to stop mess These people are compromising her evidence This issue of the investigators is troublesome Some documents were not read into record in today’s evidence because of incompetence So this is how Jarana handled the turn around strategy
Mr Q,mmh these employees lived a life of fear and pain at SAA Gavin Watson ain't black malfeasance.... DO NOT generalize!!! corruption and greed dont have color.. wake up she is tired of all the drama and stress There are Americans living in the streets too I've been to Bangkok Thailand... there are people sleeping in the streets too a lot is gonna happen in SA in the next 10 years..
