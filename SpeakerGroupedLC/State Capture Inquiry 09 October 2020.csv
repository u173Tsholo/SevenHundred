Thieves are having chest pains now. Hawks are moving to fast for them😂😂 @Previous what are you asking? @Previous.... butternut? arrest him in his firepool or his hiding in his amphitheater @Freddy even if he was still president it wouldn't warrent special treatment. They forget that they are servants of the people and not GODs "he was even given the option to testify on zoom. when he frequented the compound he didn't worry about his health @Mente go ask the nurse who birthed you @Previous yesses was that really our president 😲😲😲 anc did us wrong for very long @Gaum also he will never have peace until the day he goes back to the dust that he is "@previous even Zuma didn't have requirements. An ordinary citizen could've done much better then that thing. Anc must stop forcing their choices on us zondo must just remove the previous title of president of that thieve from his mind and just see him as thd regular thieve that he is en summon. They give him to much airtime "pretorius will be crucified for being white because he is arguing this very point now. watch the space. If all else fails @Lwazi swty what's the problem "if an ordinary citizen is summoned to appear in court "zondo take off that kid gloves. You are giving Zuma ideas now to say ""leave me alone!" @Gala let's leave him messages then @blake haibo but whole day? 🙄 @blake fine but other days I'll be watching👀👀 @mabasa call him and ask him where he is. How must we know where is Pravin. @pastor they don't want that truth all this for a man who said he wants his day in court. So whats the problem now "Pravin will come @previous you must email the commission and ask them. @Gala the detractors amongst us will always do what they are sent to do. "@Previous no I'm serious. You can email them. I just don't have the email address but as a citizen you have thd right to email them. Not rude "the ""Pravin"" bregade is just following the eff rethotic. The pillar that says make as much noise about the ones we hate @rohan I think he is trying to cover all bases so they those pr Bono lawyers have nothing else to fall back on after this @Mbasa you don't pay taxes so don't worry about our money. When Zuma gave our money's to guptas you didn't say anything. Zuma is one of this countries worst curses. Even ancestors will agree "missing the enca chatroom lol they saw all of you complain about the sound yes pretorius it really is coincidental😲😲 "@Amen it's not about who he likes. He won't like anyone so the butternut is summoned. What does the brigade say now😂😂 His lawyers now looking frantically for any loophole they can find @lufuno go love in with Edwin Sodi. the wealth you could've have he was living in and driving. Don't get it twisted lol nihaus the clown. Wonder how his mom is doing @Thando 😲😲😲😲 @thando 😢😢😢😢 I missed you my hubby sabc is stingy with screen time today it's a pity enca chats is off. @pastor can you ask them what happened?

Ntsikelelo Mgxigxwà,morning guys mr.Zuma forgets he is no longer the president
Shivuri Mpanyaza,is time to payback "since last of last year they talking about Zuma. Zuma is criminal man he deserve to be in jail
Smangele Xaba,Morning:goodvibes:
Isaac Marutha,"Zuma must just come clean nd attend the commission "he think he is above the Law  "Zuma supporter must be charged as well they are Idiot  "Mr Zondo is not going anywhere what is special with this Zuma "Criminals deserve to be jailed  I don't see any Scary sign on Mr Zondo
Rory Lee Farnham,If he does not appear he must be arrested and jailed where he belongs. "Zuma This man is a blatant liar. He is a Gupta puppet.
Theko Malangeni,"people must go to jail now "zondo must catch the big fish "these people who doesn't want to appear in commission
FieliesSA,"It comes from a public protector subpoena him. He wont come otherwise Zondo extremely methodical and thorough. Zuma has no leg to stand on @ALTA Amen @ALTA Madonsela brushed of comments of becoming the first female president. She said we need to focus on getting the right one first. Now that is presidential material "Only people interested in instant gratifications and wealth support Zuma. They dont want a better No no no we need sound! Gupta curry vapours from all the gupta links are corroding the mic's:D:D:D Oh YEAH Not even my wife can have me that day 😀 You have our full support(Most of us atleast) To think Zuma is sitting with his laywers watching this :D. Hi Zuma! """unlocking cash""... Meaning holding back funds from other departments for wasteful spenditure (looting)" I think he is a chat bot
xolani mzolo,but Zuma himself established the commission SOUND Done DCJ is clear trust you me JG Zuma will pull 1 more stunt
Peet Venter,@bongile sango 😄It's more like bats! Zumpie is probably watching this live feed. eNCA sound was fine. Zuma's lawyers too should be charged with obstruction of justice and defeating the ends of justice. Zuma can zoom but testify he will.
styx ndlovo,You going to jail herdboy
MUSA HLUNGWANI,Zuma is a character and half His lawyers are misleading him though Who’s here today ( witness )
Mpho Khoza,@Issack Marutha arrested for being idiots Including Magashule's all need to be whipped then arrested grand mfethu Is DCJ aware of Morons who support Zupta outside
ma baker,DCJ not in the mood for nonsense. JZ will get his sapoena today. arrested Bandile Masuku health MEC Gauteng cleared of any wrongdoing. ????????? I give up on SABC
Will,Hiding from the law = Lawlessless. I thought Zuma wants to sing like a canary... Zondo vs Zuma. Zondo MUST win. A Zondo win will mean a win for SA @Yolo More Zuma must go to jail once and for all Pravin does not have 34 witnesses accusing him. Zuma has. Zuma is the clear issue Zuma need to understand. period Malema told Zuma not to come. They are buddies buddies Zuma just lies No truth coming from Zuma's mouth
Foday Bangura,Weldon I like this commission of inquiry
Jenny Whitewaves,If Zuma gets away with this the commission has failed this is a watershed moment do we live in a legal controlled state or political controlled state I think I heard in the commission that if the implicated person does not appear then the implications are taken to be true any one else remember that No way that DCJ has not spoken to other chief judges for interpretation of the law about this he had lots of time. He going down the road the constitutional court would find because he's asked them DCj passed geography he knows this is JHB not Stalingrad even if he comes and has total memory loss He is needed to make the Zondo findings less able to be contested because he would have had the opportunity to put his side @Kerry van Schalkwyk exactly this is an insult to every person in SA @Kerry van Schalkwyk also insulting to those whose chances of becoming employed and dragging themselves out of poverty were ruined by state capture and the corruption it engendered @Amen Eugen you can't go to court on a charge of theft and say you don't like the judge because he has been hard on other thieves You have to have better reasons than Zuma has Just a last hope @James Dreamer That was a real reason rather than the judge doesn't like me or my families don't like each other @James Dreamer No lawyer representing those witnesses have complained as they would have done so if merited recusal. They have objected to certain questions and that dealt with one by one @James Dreamer we see as non lawyers the reasons for recusal have to be much greater than a harsh question or two @James Dreamer lets get him here and the judge the questions as we see them put. He is saying that the questions will be harsh before the are vocalised @James Dreamer we can disagree but looks as if the legal minds are not going to fall for it Thank goodness Zuma's attempts to control the legal system failed eNCA had a different Adv Hoffmeyr explaining this is only a small step to get Zuma before the commission he could easily avoid appearing Public Protector has lost bid to stop parliament's questioning her fitness to hold office @rohan barnard hope parliament gets a move on and she's thrown out Spread the story do your job or pack your bags We can see what will be in the commission's report Zondo;s got the story Masuku MEC health Gauteng fired @Mzalwane Mzala he's been fired as MEC breaking news enca @Phakamile Khuzwayo Discharged means will you leave your job please. Fired means will you leave your job. All in all he will not be at his desk tomorrow @Phakamile Khuzwayo no sorry discharged don't include a reappointment only a goodbye He may be reappointed If you discharge your employee he's gone @Phakamile Khuzwayo what will be will be but this kind of action is not done without some basis
Freddy Matlala,"Valencia :washhands::washhands::washhands::washhands::washhands::washhands: Zondo sir
Siyabulela Mente,if Pravin Gordan failed to appear to the commission.. what. makes Mr. Zuma. different? :please don't blame Zuma for the sound
LB,Zuma has been above the law for too long. Not any more! For the sake of SA Zuma's first appearance was a waste of everyone's time "Zuma
Wildthing,now listen Zuma supporters ha ha Eion R20 that you wrong Asandra you talking of some one from Wakandla not Zuma Gary it did not work. There is a whole bunch of ANC MPs shaking in there boots when hearing that. The joining of the dots This is a very smart Judge still to far away he should be here next week.
Elwyn Schenk,What about Dudu Myeni who failed to appear Zumba bragged he would like his day in court and he would implicate many people. Now he is dead scared. Man of straw.
Gaongalelwe Makhetha,Read the section that gives me powers. Yes Sir As I understand the law.
Isaac Patsa,Mornings. Mornings All The difference is that JZ occupied their highest office in the republic. and we expected highest level of ethical & moral standards from a sitting head of sate . But he failed us as a county horrible

Eion Gaum,"Believe me @Michael Wild Make that a R1000 @Valencia J AMEN @ Humbulani Mulaudzi Unfortunately not in SA
Dave van David,Remember he must come and substantiate his spy Accusations he remembered 35 years ago but fail to remember his call to Themba Maseko 🤔 he is now behaving as an inspirational hero to criminals... criminals are excited by him ducking and diving the law🤔 DCJ Zondo 54 Millions of South Africans are behind you... only ATM and Blf and AfM and Hlaudi voters are against you🤔... ATM won only 2 seats... Sleep well DCJ don't be bothered... sharing state TS information to private citizens amounts to Treason 👮‍♂️ he is afraid that he is going to EXPOSE himself more of a joke let alone the allegations... hence Humiliation in his letters 🤔🤔 Khwezi is smiling wherever she is... Redi Tlhabi is gonna do it for you girl...
Jan Nare,I got the impression that zondo is afraid of Zuma.
Moleti Moseki,This swine steals from the south African people and he feels entitled So if he doesn't appear can he arrested for obstruction Who is paying Zumas legal fees? I hope it's not our tax money Is he still receiving his state benefits from the tax payers. Zuma is being implicated in so many things. He needs to come and give his side of the story. If he doesn't give his side of the story then the judgment will be based on what has being heard. So it should be easy to arrest him. Bloody agents. He is still waisting our tax by not complying. Did Brian Molefe every appear before the commission Your duty is to the people of South Africa not the ANC party Let's go for Let's It's a criminal offense. I guess His lawyers are not advising Zuma correctly cause they want to milk him of every cent. All lawyers study from the same books right 10am 16-20/11/2020 He is repeating it... so no one can say they didn't hear😅😅😅 The screen is small now Answer Mr Tsotsi
Michael Motsepe,Zuma must appear before the commission. Theres no way he mustn't account for his Crimes. His likes and those of Magashules have brought this country into a mess

Mtokozisi Baleni,guys this is not a court of law. lts not going to say Zuma is guilty or Innocent. It will only make recommendations which will be challenged in courts. Still a long way. @cavin Davis becareful with that statement... Zuma uses opportunities where law is lose and unclear to his advantage and buys more time. I see nothing wrong there. If you wish to get him fix the lops in law. He will do it over and over again it. "Zuma was Umkhoto Wesizwe intelligence boss @phakamile it means his not stupid as most of us think here @Cruda you know nothing about Zulus i suggest you stop it. @Phakamile hes been mislead by biased and a pushing narrative media Zuma will be summoned and will appear.... End of story @Bongumuzi Big headlines as if hes found guilty It will be live from Nkandla.....he will take them to court for security breaches again....

One And Only,why Parven was not forced it is his right to ask the chair to recuse himself if he not comfortable with him. people are not treated the same here "we all know that this commission was Made for Zuma the fact that some1 is accused it's doesn't mean the he has no rights. who was the vice President at that time why did he stop or expose corruption that took place at his watch if the vice President of that time is as clean and transparent as we understand why did he expose corruption that took place for 9 years. now he is willing to come and testify "why did the vice President of that time not expose corruption in that 9 wasted years they speak of. now he's willing to testify Mzalwane they clutched but did nothing that's we are where we are today I hv a feeling that this will in a very bad way that will affect most of us in this country. just watch

He should have just sent summons. KG Kagiso You were killed in the pst if you worked with a white man. This is why Zuma will never work with bo Oppenheimer & Ruperts.. "Adv.

TT Mabona,"Thank you
Adele Mohola,ZumaaAaa😫😂😂😂😂😂
Rita,judge zondo what Mr Zuma thinks of you or the commission is irrelevant. you need to do your job for the people of this country "I never said there should be exceptions if judge zondo requests his appearance then he must oblige. did judge zondo ask him to appear @sabelo im sure judge zondo won't forget Gordan had commitments at the time. should he needs to appear for whatever reason judge zondo will do what is required without fear or favour dont you think? I dont believe judge zondo needs to explain what he needs to do. Zuma has hung himself Kg Kagiso and whats your point wow you go judge zondo........... whoooo whooo... ubaba coming to the zondo commission 15 nov i wait with abaited breath @ vuyo appear or be arrested I need time to deal with all the uhumms humms throat clearings
Bubele Stofile,the sound system is interapted by the negative forces of the underworld
Dismond Nakanyala,Classic man JZ he appoints zondo in the face of CR mr president now how do you know he was not advised by his associates Move on the answer you seek from Zuma can come from his Luthuli colleque once they come on the commission then we can know how and why we are at this crossroads

Maeko MoChana Charlton,✊🏿Why are we still using Apartheid laws?🤔 Dankie chair for the leadership✊🏿✊🏿☮️
JK SEDU,But why didn’t Zuma work with Ruperts like everyone just to have peace? Zuma should have worked with WMC to make sure that they get 100% ESKOM SAA & Gov business. We all do that!! Evidence leader is said to have been Pravin’s personal lawyer. 😂😂😂😂😂 Bantu Education is the only reason why we focus on Guptas who ate only 3% of contracts at ESKOM 80% of major ESKOM SAA and Government contracts aren’t dominated by WHITE COMPANIES. Why didn’t he work with WMC???? Arrest him! Next month it’s Malema who’ll be in court. WMC RULES!!
Singi Mathebula,But who is Zuma in the lives of over 52 million people mara? General amnesty on condition they accept and pay back. he wena Dominic🖕 "rohan@you not different . We are now in level 1

Pheladi Lamola,I heard her as well Is that right @Andy.😂😂 The wenzenists are hopeless. They are too far gone. Nobody can help them now. And then? Whoever is messing with the picture must still be in shock from what transpired about JZ So how did it end with MsKlein yesterday? I had to stop watching just before 6pm. Thank you @Tommygun. I'll have to revisit yesterday's proceedings. I went to eNCA but came back because the comments are turned off that side. I missed my community We are analysts here. It's wonderful to watch. It's all of us Thapelo. I hate it when they put us on live TV because come 12 o'clock they'll cross back for news and we'll miss important bits. Eish Well said @Naledi Barron. Sounds like Bandile Masuku has just been fired Makhura thinks he's clever. The SIU says Masuku failed in his duties but Makhura says if he's not found guilty of corruption he'll reistate him. What does that even mean? I'll wait for the SIU report. Not sure how I feel about Sullivan's report. It's Matjila @Sabelo Nxumalo Did Malesela Phukubye give testimony yesterday? What's the difference between fired and discharged in terms of this Masuku saga?

Blocked the spy. @Christopher Peters 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Bandile Masuku is temporarily removed until SIU clears him. Makhura is playing summersault @Naledi Barron. It's hectic.
