alphaus Kaira,hello

RAMAPHOSA BOUGHT A RHINO FOR R18 million read about how RAMAPHOSA started NUM how Mbeki looted Zimbabwe minerals how Ramaphosa lost the opportunity to lead SA TO Zuma the point is both Zuma and Ramaphosa gvts are full of amasele Zondo is also captured Theodore you have a point why and who killed Agrizzi banks not THE RESERVE BANK the true is all these gvts are captured and they act holy. today the same guys with money in SA have deliberately led SA into a shocking 84% to GDP debt. this is bad and you call it a state Playing our Africa's second biggest economy like a casino Oppenheimer Rothschild we don't need to convict Zuma coz Ramaphosa will soon follow yeap Apache true especially the new dawn of Ramaphosa true Bheki Fana uthini who will replace the ANC? who is calling the shots in SA "I asked a question Fana step aside from this conversation you look ignorant know you talking sorry for that Fana I withdraw my words I support the DA I apologized Fana but it's rare when the ANC POLITICISES LAND exactly Dennis this guy is lying Sales Abdulla respect us please. Sal just stick to the program please Abdulla I used to support it but ANC = ZANU PF I don't trust revolutionary political parties am 100% DA Fana no doubt. The only party with true accountability distracted by sellouts am glad the ANC will Lose the up coming municipality elections "Luna because the ANC is blocking funding look at Johannesburg what they did to Mashaba ANC is known for politicizing governance issues despite that ANC is behind all these developments the ANC is the black jesus to some yet the so called liberators are the biggest looters of this country.

bhekizizwe nkambule,true Boyabenyatsi who is not corrupt in South Africa? let him rise up if you think it's only Mr. Zuma who was corrupt then your brains is corrupted "just leave Mr. Zuma alone stop hating Mr. Zuma and focus on yourself "if Mr Zuma is corrupt then Theodore John ​The Queen of England is a shareholder in the Reserve bank of SA. Germany is also a major shareholder.... is it also Mr. Zuma? was he responsible for this? but that's where corruption is...Fana Nkosi ​zuma is not in the league of powerful business leaders Fana Nkosi ​zuma is head boy from nkandla.... nyalo -ke sowuyanya Fana Nkosi ​state cupture and arms deal waiting zuma ... and you will get the shock of your life Fana Nkosi ​ungathukani nkambule...nawe ungadzeleli "@Fana Nkosi  "I still respect and salute Mr.Zuma our struggle fighter For me Mr. Zuma was my first black president it is unfortunate that people believed everything they were told by media I still say if they had a proof of any thing to send him to jail... he could have long gone to prison but they have nothing. Thank you Nxamalala
raymond thurston,yes ammie we have long ago faced the music & will continue to do so as long as we play the race game. and not admit to reality & who are the people that continue to sell us out. "if any one of you who are smart unduly benefitted from tax payers money
john karanja,we have to save ourself .tuangamize corona
Michael Lawrence,this guys body language just looks questionable looks very on edge
David Joza,How many millions had been used already for this commission? The Anc government had caused us.
Theodore John,Guys. what we need to appreciate as Africans is that our economies are indirectly controlled either by the Western countries or the Eastern countries. The corruption we see in Africa is induced by outside forces. How is it normal that SA's reserve bank is privately owned and that most of its shareholders are not South African? SA is one of the few 6 countries world wide with a reserve bank that is privately owned The Queen of England is a shareholder in the Reserve bank of SA. Germany is also a major shareholder. That is why wealth redistribution in SA will be a very difficult thing to achieve. very powerful people indirectly own and controll this country @nkambule is very easy to be connected if you are an influential politician. And why hasn't it changed. the reserve bank of SA is the oldest central bank in Africa founded in 1921. why hasn't it been nationalized till now. what's stopping the government from.?
Jacqui Baumgardt,"hey @Lebogang Maseje - the epitome of corruption
Lebogang Maseje,Zuma was corrupt
Thulani Bukani,limenemene lotata

apache black,rampant theft and fraud from politicians is preventing nationalisation of reserve bank. thieves in charge Gucci revolutionaries have looted the country beyond recognition. "who is president? Cyril monopoly on theft and looting ANC cadres the ANC is franchising criminality.... LoL
FieliesSA,In the words of Smuts Ngonyama : I did not join the struggle to be poor. ANC looting and keeping the money for themself
dennis oldude,We need to ensure that we have franchised voters who can't be bought with a food hamper and a t shirt otherwise we are beyond help And J Kop says he he he he who didn' tbuy7 teh voters And all this accountant does is pass the buck to the 'back office'it's not his fault he just gets he big bucks Wouldn't it be nice to get this thing moving at a walking pace rather than crawling long the way it has been going for the last 2 years? Auditors and lawyers are obviously in competition to see who can lie and get away with the lie? In both cases they get paid exorbitant amounts but bear no responsibility for the outcome a
Bridget Mabusela,Dnt care which party replaces ANC. Just want Herman Mashaba back in JHB.
Sal SA,This inquiry is of public interest please stick to comments and opinions that are related to it. Suggest to take private matters offline to another forum. It is very distracting Exactly the reason why our country loses billions. Our People are conned and side tracked.

Goitsimang Mogorosi,Can the commission please bring that Auditor who didn’t do due diligence in this regard?
Elton Josea,chair yes chAIR HELP ME IM STUCK IN A TREE His junior colleagues has been under the impression he is boss. hahahahahah
Nicollette Ferguson,"ammie Fana..Anc had promised everyone will get a RDP house... 26 years later why have they not done it! Look at all the municipalities that had failed with the annual audits? Who was the Corporate Governance Officer of SAA? That would have exposed this looting. eh eh eh... hmmm 🤥 Nolan 100% but who did the half year audit? If you work for PWC you have to sign a declaration of truth. I would have... why did you not do it sir? 100% you have TO declare any irregularities PWC jail time Mr PWC You have to declare all irregularities Did he sign the audit off? What? body language He works for PWC... why can he not answer these questions? "The deliverable list requires all GL accounts 100% It should be yes PWC "Why does he keep on looking at the ceiling lol or if its painted.. "So why was it not followed up "That is a lie What 60% "Yes Cheers guys see you all tomorrow 🙋🏼‍♀️🕊
Alex Ngoy,MR. PULE MOTHIBA HAS NO CONFIDENCE IN WHAT HE IS TESTIFYING. WHY?
Rudolf Gaweseb,BoRiNG
greenspacessa,PWC Jou lekker ding
Nolan_on-air,Haha! Listen to this guy panicking PWC must be held accountable for this behavior
#dm70,This PWC auditor doesn't know what he is talking about. It's so obvious that he is hiding something.
Alvino Theunissen,Mr Zondo always have a excuse with aircon and lighting wasting the Tax payers money not completing the process. Mr Moshiba playing confused! Chair dont sleep can you please follow?
Samantha Barnes,All the giggling? Are reported irregularities in awarding tenders a laughing matter? May the law take its course against those found guilty of squandering tax payers money. Exactly. The slower it takes the more lawyers earn.
Wade Solomon,ANC PWC man?
HALO,The anc must fall! "ANC should be ANL Democracy is one of the biggest political scams. Illusion of choice. Wake up! Yourll sit by and let governments do all this corruption. We must stand together against corruption. Anc only cares about stealing money. We need a white government. I'm not even white but I know white government will do a much better job. FACT. How could this government let crime rate become the highest in the world? The african race was not ready to lead this country. Many african politicians worked hard but there's too much corruption Anc is corrupted "Look at how many people trusted Jacob Zuma Obviously! You should bloody know by now that the entire global society is run by unholy people. Human society is heavily influenced by demonic forces. If you dont know this then you sleeping You see people like to sin and they many are comfortable being slaves to money so some may actually fight to protect the corrupted economic system. Majority of humanity doesn't even know the situation we are in. There is spiritual war going on all the time "People care more about pop culture and ""celebrity"" news. People are not aware to what is really happening on Earth." Its why only a few people witness miracles "The evil humans use black magic "Witchcraft "No man The mass deception is happening now. When you realise what governments are really like I dont how you can just ignore it You know demon forces lie to people just so that they can get people to do horrible things so then the demon forces make that person rich or whatever. Its all made to make human fall from grace A demon deal will make a person seem like they have magical powers but in reality that person has caused separation from heaven and the demon is the one who actually rules that person Why do you think evil magic practitioners have to do horrible things? Its because the demons hate humanity and by influencing humans to do evil things that person will lose The Lord's favour. Wake up. "You must stop sinning. The Lord is holy Unless you experience you wont believe. Many people fall for the deception of evil spirits because they see the works of the evil spirits. "This life is about the choices we make. Heaven wants us to be holy. The Lord is holy People think that there's no such thing as morality so they dont feel guilty about sinning but deep down many always feel bad after sinning. Majority of people side with the devil "I guarantee that majority of people dont know how powerful humans can really become. It all comes from The Lord If everyone on Earth becomes holy we can rehabilitate this Earth and create a utopia. But the prophecies were given for a reason. So I just got to try and expose people to the truth. Your gotta make your own effort though
