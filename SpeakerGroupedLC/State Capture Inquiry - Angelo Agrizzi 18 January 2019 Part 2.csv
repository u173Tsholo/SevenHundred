Aubrey Moloi,where is everyone oh I left eNCA because sound is bad & a troll named Yose. Now I can you see you guys "The commission is 'captured"" too via the secretary - how many people are not tainted in this country except me?" @Khalid Mather I see he will take leave Have you ever thought what would happen if Agrizzi says they paid the Chief Justice also? I would pack my bags and leave Sata Afrika Mara why is Dudu Myeni not arrested Lindiwe is the same whatsapp group as Nomvula/Bathabile. "Remember the SIU was done with Bosasa investigation 10 years ago. The file is gathering (or gathered already) dust at the NPA offices The law enforcement is still a joke. They bundled a simple case in the FS - vrede farm. They will not succeed with Bosasa we need to change our constitution. We vote for political parties that elect people to sit in parliament. therefore the party that wins controls parliament. No accountability at all..... @Mo P The Anc is arrogant Our problem in this country is old people that carry bargage from the past. Let young blood lead "CR said it is a legitimate contract. From what Agrizzi is saying "Remember corruption started with the arms deal "Cr left and became a conduit for ANC in business "They are tired of carrying bags of money via liquor stores. They now want it directly from the Reserve Bank Who is enabling the corruption @IamAman Dempisi . Is it not the ANC requesting bribes? Hlaudi's legal fees were paid for by Bosasa "if the ANC cannot manage a simple municipality We will only nationalize during the time of EFF Gavin Watson said it is for Andile Ramaphosa Foundation as per whistleblower. CR said Andile had a legitimate contract. Somebody is lying and we must build a border wall too. "We must thank DD Mabuza and his bogus branches from saving us. Was it not for his change of heart "South afRICA ke banana republic thanks to the ANC "Women that died in abusive relationships always spoke of 'give him last chance""; NO last chance" Leave Oros - heart diseases will take care of him from the many burgers that Guptas bought him CR received Billions from PIC to buy a stake in ALexander Forbes and lot more WMC companies that benefitted from govt. His fingerprints are everywhere. He tried teaching ANdile the art but we see now @KD Sibisi i missed that about Oros Ok .

Khalid Mather,"Welcome  "Why do people want to make the chats a volatile environment  what was the media statement regarding secretary? Take criminal leave? is that like sick leave but South Africa She is such a thief :O "Corrupt ANC women 😞  "I think the age of elections are coming to an end "South Africa is a big cash cow for extractivists and mining magnates "and his brother in law Patrice Motsephe made his money from dehumanizing mining  its insidious now they trying to kill activists at Xolobeni :( 😞 so sad SeaArk "best time possible  and pit latrines didnt SARS CHECK any of this criminalism sies "too many last rounds....and they are not stopping their evil ways  the Xolobeni saga will unravel the rural support for ANC now they know not to lol true lol "black people got to stop hiding behind the veil of collective ignorance  Agrizzi is tired and he is being grilled now "because he gotta admit he benefitted publicly  "If you are ignorant and cause a crime you still guilty of a crime stop playing dumb you @Buyiswa Mnyani are you believing your own lies? "i think time to block Buyi  she lost the plot 2017 hamba gahle Buyi He is feeling hot :O bye

Bongumenzi Nxumalo,Hlaudi Hlaudi Remember Zuma saying those who point fingers are also corrupt Ayeye Ubaba kaAndile ThIS FORCE OF MINE THIXO
Dan Bourne Yeshurun,ANC ON TRIAL I want them to slap Dudu Myeni with a mean subpoena Zumas can't go to jail.. not even for vehicular double murder Ginger doesn't care zumas have been enriching ppl for decades.. it will be hard for blacks to give Zuma up "inquiry commissions are the new jail sentences in SA. someone lays a charge on you the only way to bring down corrupt high profile people is to also implicate yourself I am seeing.. "Dudu Myeni Zuma will be doing alot if heavy breathing and saying ""I donte rememba""" lol no it was a donation age is 3rd or 4th issue... u need to drain the corruption swamp.. imagine all the hundreds of billions lost by corruption actually went to SA fiscus.. so many people would still be alive wired question to dodge weird I think its hilarious that an Oppenhaeimer implicates an ANC minister says alot ANC are paying the bribes for favors and SECRECY Zuma couldn't capture Thulie 😂 Buyiswa..... "quiet shifting change away from ANC. greed is greed blame* not change she is confusing business corruption i.e. WMC and saying they are responsible for political corruption ANC "in vice versa
ramotodi moraba,"Smith "It's time to exposed mayor  ramaphosa function will make deal with zuma function! No one will prosecute evry1 has smaller nyana skeleton . bathabile master KG this government feed only old people "donation  hlaudi very gud for opposition moyani nxt this last 4 month is enough for ANC "this 17 million people who reserve SASA "Whr is ANCYL
