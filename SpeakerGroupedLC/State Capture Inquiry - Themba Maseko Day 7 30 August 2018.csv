Sindiswa Moolman,There we go.... "If subpoenaed  I think it was mentioned that Gigaba and Pravina will appear here either later today or tomorrow @siphiwe mathibela @siphiwe mathibela The inquiry is based on the recommendations from the PP which are enforceable. The President had no option Saxonworld was a regular cabinet meeting venue. "I always wonder why the BLF continue doing so "Ouch...@Thando Nkutha "This is the best testimony so far. It is specific and makes it easy to have the links @Lorna Kavanagh Can you please stop campaigning guys? We want to focus on why we are here. I will get her number for you @J Ganasan Or the madam @J Ganasan He fired Themba @Auti Mjita I agree @makhosi nobhatyi Now I understand why the departments were instructed to use the New Age to advertise government events and vacancies. Jimmy Manyi must come and testify here. Its no longer about the organisation now @Sipho Mahlangu. Its about the country and the fact that he sold us to foreigners. An assassination called car accident @happymaboane. The other party in that accident must come and explain. Jimmy changed to Mzwanele. and they love him too @Thando Nkutha "two of those ministers died.... mhmmm Yes Zumas cabinet was 90%corrupt @kwado kyei . But I can say now 10% of CR cabinet may be corrupt because there are ppl who remained from the previous order. Heeee what happened to Baloyi kakade? Who is next??? I believe so too @Mbongiseni Jonase
zamo Maluka,what a cool guy themba and truthful waiting to see Gigamba😁😁😁😁 "your president is implicated mos 
Thana Ndlovu,sound is horrible mmhhhh chair is slowly today @Abdul ..i wish people were saying the same thing about Mentor cant wait for Gigaba lol yes I want to hear what he has to say Ajay Gupta though Former Minister of Finance Ajay even promised Mentor that sge will be the Minister Nothing can justify corruption And go to jail We must strike..shut down everything if nobody is going to jail People stop undermining Mentor..she tried her best @Mzala ...thank you very much.. people much listen carefully Maseko is mentioning Gigaba... meaning this thing is new I want Malema to cross examine Gigaba after his whitness🤣😂😂😂😂😂 He got Nkandla😂🤣🤣😂😂 benylin😂🤣🤣🤣
makhosi nobhatyi,We are listening carefully Mr Maseko we are behind have a courage to tell truth Mhmmm Gordhan that father is so brilliant All of this is about 8 years ago "Where are they? You won’t find Gupta here I assumed if they will come to testify "Maseko is competent and confident
Thabang Khalienyane,we only need the truth nothing else..
cris calvins,strong man n courageous is Mr Maseko grigamba is coming too???? Melusi the home affairs guy @GEORGE SOLOMON BANDA do you watch Izikhokho they usually joke using that word @noko yamebetlwa respect I agree but they have cases to respond too regardless of position they hold in gvt so everyone In jail is not a criminal bt made a mistake???? @ noko come my guy anyone who holds a higher office must conduct him/herself in a justified manner "corruption is corruption its not a mistake @ nomthandazo true that imagine how many RDP houses would b built with all that money @noko yamebetlwa with guidance from the PP and recommendations from the judge they can open a case my guy @noko yamebetlwa I agree but rightfully a criminal has a place in jail or payback the money eg check the Marikana Inquiry @noko yamebetlwa so you agree an inquiry produces some results @noko yamebetlwa now you talking my guy who is guilty @noko yamebetlwa is it only JZ? I guess also some of his ministers also got pieces of the pie baked by e guptas wats happening thre @ Marvell? eish or they disrupted it intentionally
Ndlela Mkhululi,Ronweni mbhele
Domenico Tomé,Lucky for the country numerous government officials will face criminal and civil charges for their actions and to recover the stolen tax payers money before Inquiry is completed. "These Ministers and other government officials who signed any documentation that allowed corruption and fraud with state funding to happen
siphiwe mathibela,Will Zuma come to testify? Will Gigaba come to testify? I'm not sure Guys Why did the president agreed to this inquiry... I think this inquiry will course peoples lives? What do you think "Yes "They say he was born in KZN...but we don't believe it Guptas...are controlling the country guys...WOW NOW WE KNOW.. Every department there's a Gupta brother.. @noko yamebetlwa...What RESPECT are you talking about baba? We are not going to respect criminals "Yes The truth will come out very soon... I agree @abraham rambuda @Mohammed Abdul tell them guys!! corruption is not a mistake @noko yamebetlwa Why do you allow to be Used on that office? @noko yamebetlwa Now you're taking...Who is guilty vele? Minister Chabane now....that means all our minsters are employed by the Guptas.. Bostol...for the one with flu Who is this Millicent now...lol We're back
Joseph Thobejane,yes he will where its cigaba born ajay guptar its a stering

GEORGE SOLOMON BANDA,is mr Melusi also featuring here? how ones appearance has no space and credence in this world of today colonil mental inculcated into poor africans by their masters as way of dividing us grigamba ia a racial foul word whose hidden or open meaning insinuate hared and rejection along ethnical or tribal lines.i guess so "ooh no
Philani ngcobo,I'm from KZN and I am a Zulu it's not nice to hear people mocking Mr Zuma about his heard.
Xolani Mcoyana,we mocking his head not Zulu
Ms S J Mokoatle,ya neh
abraham rambuda,@noko yamebetlwa respect is earned bro is not something that you can demand. You get it through your conduct @Thando Nkutha who are you reffeing to? @peter pott colaborate to do what? @J Ganasan What are you smoking bro? South Africa is now a joke @Philani Madlala please mfethu tell them @J Ganasan why do i have the feeling you are a racist My brother I am a psychologist and can read between the line @Millicent Shozi of cause they have earned themselves a celebrity status and i am sure you can't stand it cause they are exposing Zuma @Orefile Macheoane you are ryt and they dont even care about this stupid as they know it wont have any impact @Millicent Shozi No we must give Zuma a round of applause because he is Zulu from KZN
Queen K,Noko ukhuluma ngani? Does that mean we people kills and rape we must respect them because they made a mistake? A mistake is you do once not for all these years and then you tell us they made a mistake?mistake my foot!!
MCEBISI MBUSI,our people lived in shacks long time but all of a sadden ANC government spent millions of billions at GUPTAS Anc must fall
Mzalwane Mzala,ANC renewal Imvuselelo ANC Mentor testified about things that happened 8 years ago and others are testifying about things that are more recent. @J Ganasan No comment 😀😀 Maseko was GCIS CEO when Mandela died and that was not 8 years ago. The Tshwane council is live. ANC leads ANC lives Adv Maleka There was a vacancy in DPSA It sounds like the Xoliswa Sibeko case as DG of Sport and Correctional service Commissioner. @pheladi lamola You're welcome "Xoliswa Sibeko was pushed to Sport and the Minister then Themba James Maseko a solid comrade that we know from the sturggle days. Bomafikizolo don't know him and try to rubbish his name Those who refused to listen to Jacob Zuma in a May Day rally were not white. ANC is the people's choice ANC the hope of our people The people have proven time and time again that they will not be dictated to when it comes to voting. ANC they vote This is the renewal of the ANC
no frog,wasting money at end no one will be prosecuted watch the space!!!!!!!!!! yes Nomtha can anyone tell who is in jail right now as a result of sittings or enquiries if you are politic lover be prepared to be played i think they must call Guptas to came answer all allegations but no where to be found
Jonathan Palivili,thw biggest mistake was the ANC running this country... The IFP or any other party would have done a much better job...
Ibo Thabo,"JZ was and is a gullible to be fool on everything from woman’s body "Why the ANC was sleeping all of the days What people here think for those South Africans still standing & supporting JZ?
J Ganasan,"another day this guy has the most awful teeth - yuck Mzala - tru. 8 years ago Mentor had the body of a supermodel "Gupta must be feeding Zuma and his ministers lots of curry and whiskey. And when they leave  lets drop this commission and have one on HOW CYRIL MADE HIS MILLIONS South Africa should consider becoming a colony of AUstralia or outsource the government to New Zealand Yes Jason - we all know ANC is corrupt to the core . full of useless thieves He was taking Mentor to Sun City for a weekend of bonking GOlf tournament ? Likely story. Bet he scored a hole in one Gupta must have supplied the holes "The Chairman is seen scribblking "Just block Raguel ABraham - what gave u that idea? how absurd that lady in the glasses is cute Abraham - can u see my middle finger between the lines? she is cute thanks Moolman. You da man ! Mamoloko - do you like his teeth as well ? The cabinet meetings and the whole government is a circus run by clowns Orefile - that is such a lame story "Maseko as are all ANC Masekop's minister bent over backwards ? Are they both gay ? Maleka - cmon - why didnt you ask that question Maseko comes across as an incompetent fool. Waste of taxpayers money How much did they offer you to leave ? @Noko - all ANC is garbage Now we have another thief - Cyril The cute girl is looking at me and smiling "Moko - don't vote based on color @Sipho - you are wrong Moko - all parties should be multi racial. with members who support the party policies @Millicnet - its NOT your land. We are all Africans. ANyone can own land Shall we trace all land back to the original inhabitant and give it all back. Where do we start? Brain drain ? hahahaha - all the duds who cant get jobs in private sector end up in government Ooh - i just saw a cute black girl in a pale yellow jacket she cud be my 3rd wife @ Millicent - I'm just a red blooded male. Happy go lucky @Millicent - u sound jealous blessers? whats that? "@Millicent Shozi  Vote DA Maleka - please dont smile - ure teeth are effing awful @Millicent Shozi - traitors? why @Millicent Shozi - its multi racial @Millicent Shozi - ur racist theres the cute black girl again\ @Millicent Shozi - leave ur husband. come with me @Millicent Shozi - ok . but i have to have sex 3 x a day. can u handle it "Milli - at 2 hours a round  vote DA Democratic Alliance 👍 only truly multi racial party South Africa for all races ANC wont change - now another corrupt bastsrd in charge - Cyril noko - just chill. vote DA Oh no - the lady lawyer with the bad teeth is back now noko - u r racist. DA is a multi racial party haha - the ugly fat journo is back Marx was a fool COmmunism failed everywhere else @stunner - they all bald 🤣 noko - thats the most stupid thing Ive heard. every one is valued in DA Chairman and that hottie look pl;eased with themselves Communism makes a few people ridiculously wealthy and 99% poor
Philani Madlala,"I think only men can help this enquiry "She tried speaking controversies After the enquiry it's gonna be court proceedings. The enquiry can only make recommendations and by that time maybe Zuma will be dead "I just wish this commission can be done in 6 months compared to what they previously predicted {2 years} which will be too long. People must be jailed here "Don't judge people calling them names fseg eff Why involve EFF here? This meeting got nothing to do with the EFF: don't confuse assemblies
sbo dlamini,msholozi is going to Jail..this it too damning for him to walk scotch free.... the question is -How was Zuma Captured??? "@Liwalam Madikiza

Lungelo Dlaba,Imagine such audacity from the Guptas
peter pott,"Gupta behaved like many rich fellows Maseko is trying to tickle our ears with some additional information here adv maleka is seeking a newspaper headline "don't blame pres zuma ganasan! every where is like this. We heard yesterday that steinhoff r12 billion pension money is a permanent loss. gone. money for 1.1 million employees he is scared to implicate CR in this evidence😀😀😀 "answer rambuda! can the confirm if he really spoke to them "😀😀😀😀😀hola msholozi "nawe you should have stayed home. you wanted msholozi to say to I "" phuma la" "don't say that. Steinhoff "government appoint staff "as you occupy that post there is another nxasana? how much wena did you get Mr Maseko? how much was the offer and based on what???? We are in a rush here baba "goodbye for what? Hamba you missed your dentist appointment to put a false teeth in the gap Adv Maleka? "public works concourt judge. he is going to nxasana judgement. maseko scored undeserved money from pres zuma to buy him out. he doesn't want to disclose the figure this guy ministers end up dead. haikhona! pres zuma chased him away for that reason "😀😀😀there is someone Mr Maseko must have fired

Nozipho Thembeka,how much did Zuma get ?
Orefile Macheoane,Greetings sons and daughters of the land They will try and keep the name CR17 out of it because that is another can of worms We need to understand that most people that were intitialy in this syndicate are still in high positions today My challenge is we are having a comission with missing witnesses. We need the Guptas themself to come and testify Then this is a fruitless exercise because we are acquitting people that add no value to the case. This shouldve been a great example Guys politics is just a game We are just the pawns We need to be alive to the possibilities of being brainwashed by the elite. Msholozi watched The Godfather There is no honesty yet. People are just giving their versions "i remember when Oscar told us what happened the night we lost Reeva Saxonworld is Union Buildings. We just didnt know The truth needs to be tested. always We cant believe everything we hear at first glance i honestly believe no one is being 100% truthful. And that is the reason some are refusing to come forward. This enquiry should have the whole cabinet as witnesses "The only people that know exactly what happened are Duduzane "Can we be reminded that only white collar people have privileges of inquiries Maseko is not bothered by what happens from here on in. For him this is leave. how does the public benefit from this? What difference will knowing the truth make? "No one is going to jail. No one will ever say ""i stole money"" @Thando Nkutha so far do you think anyone will get charged? phela for now everything is circumstancial No one high earning individual is jailed without reasons like murder "We have since discovered that people have been misusing funds in all SOE's. Mama Vytjie misused money from Transnet Mr Maseko is in the same league as Panyaza @Petrus Mthimkhulu name & shame Everyday i cry at the money being lost by the taxpayer. But tears mean nothing when the rich get richer. "@Millicent Shozi i asked a friend yesterday. What can you do to affect government decision making "We thought by voting for people they will stand up for you and represnt your beliefs Power corrupts. ABSOLUTE POWER in this case Lol The word reshuffle is the reason we are here For all have sinned... "On the other hand "Until we have a proper balance of youth and experience "@Kamogelo Nkosi in summary The core values @Kamogelo Nkosi So they have managed to get Trollip off in NMB but now there is no one to failitate the municipality "Behinf closed doors @thabiso phungula No one thinks like that people are happy to hear news and not deal with the nitty gritty If you tell people today that Julius Malema is still an ANC member they will lose their minds. @thabiso phungula correct Haha Limpopo and mpumalanga are the strongholds of anc... KZN is the capital Mmusi is just like Obama "Im happy with the work of DA in Jozi. But Pretoria sis not run properly
Lorna Kavanagh,nobody will ever know exactly what was looted and what Jz got. Advocate Maleka is so thorough. the Guptas will never get extradited back to SA. the commission needs more credible witnesses like Maseko... he is articulate. Advocate Maleka

Zuma is the crime boss for the Simone fact he had executive authority. ask roads lead to him and his ANC faction "😦Not ""thuma mina""😂😂" who and when is the next high profile witness?? like a minister
