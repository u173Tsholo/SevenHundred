HALO,South Africa had the highest crime rate in the world only after 1994. This is what happens when unholy people run governments "Whatever the case with this country The whole world is being deceived "The Rothschild family in London own the reserve banks. Only North Korea "But you dont only blame governments for the state of the world One person can get killed for exposing the truth. Therefore we must all unite and make a change on this world for the better. Stand up and take charge. Dont get influenced by pop culture. Wake up. "But words alone cannot make you believe "I'm not even religious but I will quote the bible Read the 7 deadly sins and resist them. Read the 12 commandments from the bible and obey them. Read the 99 commandments from the quran and obey them. This will give you some understanding. "You don't need to follow religion. Religious TEACHINGS were meant to guide people towards thr truth and to be better learn* Keep peace of mind This life is an gift meant to be enjoyed. Humans caused alot of suffering so our cosmic parent has to exercise discipline. Think about the wonders of creation. We dont keep creation running. Majority of the body's functions we dont control. Life is meant to be beautiful but humanity has been horriblly misbehaving. repent your sins. I hope the truth gets revealed to you Spread love and positivity. This is how we heal each other and this planet.

TheVaultdweller,Secession for the WesternCape is not the best idea. It will just make SA weaker @Stronger together How will splitting off be a solution to the problems of the country? "If we vote out the ANC @ ncamisile Radebe True words spoken Yes like the EFF
P B,crime though...... "I'm back living in the UK now "do people honestly still vote ANC Form a new party! "I noticed that ""some Africaans"" white people (around 2000) have their own ""white town"" in northern cape "I agree "I feel sorry for everyone not if there is no jobs?. "nobody cares anymore! n look at the taxi leader "if there's no respect "I agree with you Radebe "I agree about the 3 trillion but as it stands today "that's the best comment ""strongertogether"" EFF is a waste of time! I cannot believe they are still a party! note I didn't say political!" "Mozambique pity for your country! we may have different skin colour but we ALL the same underneath! makes me sick to see your coun5being run on REVENGE... "I lived 2 years in CT and was region manager for a foreign company "So I understand that's mostly why the country's a mess! unqualified people running businesses and also the government!
PC.61,Mr Molefe my utmost respect for being a brave citizen. One suggestion though is don't rely on CNN and MSNBC SABC eNews etc for news about Trump-FAKE NEWS. Watch Fox on youtube for a balanced view

Dominic Przybylski,The people who have money and land (i.e. the rich) are a minority in every country. "Labor "@ncamisile Radebe History is in the past (by definition). In the present we are heading into a situation where human labor will no longer be needed or wanted Looks like we will all become unemployable and will all have to live on subsistence grants. Robots are cheaper and more reliable than humans. "@ncamisile Radebe If you are online the amount of free training on the Internet is awsome. The training I got in 1982 was free and available to black and white at the ""height"" of apartheid." All that was needed was to pass an aptitude test. @ncamisile Radebe Hey that's company politics... It happened to me. It happens to people regardless of race. It's why I went independent and worked freelance. Yup @Phil Boyd I remember. I was advise to leave the country for the sake of my career by the biggest employment agency (I remember them saying they could not even offer jobs to coloured women).
