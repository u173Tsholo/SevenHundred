Sylvester Tyhali,Guptas again "Whats the name of that dark beautiful girl/lady sitting at the back Maseko is about to snitch 😁
Marvel Ramatshela,Guptas always Mr Themba Maseko seems to be a reliable witness. @Sabelo.. Not even lottery win will make us forget about the Land. We need it by yesterday. Hawks are corrupt. That entity MUST be disbanded and closed. They are implicated everywhere. We can't have an justice agency that is sinister. Hello to you too Zinqa phantsi!! "Agliotti Bernard Ntlemeza is just a fool. They used him. He's got no game plan. "@Thuso - Lets be positive "@Thando - He will take a stand Watch and learn. We need 5 days of cross examination for JZ. He's got a lot to answer. Though I know he'll deny everything #David - 30 days will do?🤔 "The Guptas are nowhere to be found Eish.Thats true @ Colanesh Tomorrow Solly Msimanga won't be a Mayor of Tshwane by the way...😃😃Politics oh Zizi Kodwa is also here. The best Spokesperson by far hey They should have locked up Ace "Mbuyiseni is intelligent  "Fils probably come from another planet. lots of African brothers are intelligent I've reported this @Fils de l'homme. hope they'll intervene. we can't continue to be insulted and discriminated by this man I've blocked him too "Red Berets are thinkers And it's not really about race - corruption gas no colour. They must all go to jail "people need to relax "@Joseph. All I can say is most of us now know how to vote. No food parcel will deter us We are not stupid loyalist for specific parties. We vote wisely for the better of our country. 2019 will be the most interesting years in South Africa. every bite will count this time I hope we are done with this race category topic. Thanks Let's meet tomorrow. I'll make the register. fine for late comers EFF is the Future!!!!!🖖🖖🖖🖖🖖🖖
Teddy Ntsente,...and we are back...
Sello Lekgoathi,Guptas all the time 🤔
stanza monyai,Mr. Maseko knows what he's talking about and am so impressed
Lindikaya Myeki,Advocate Mokoena is still the best in term of leading the witness.
DALUXOLO DINISO,he knows every think i am also very impressed he knows everything
Nkululeko Malandela,....
Smally Lengesi,guptas take the SA
Thabo Modibedi,.......😏😏😏
bernard ntaote,Mr. Maseko appears a very credible and impressive witness. let's see how he fares under cross examination. "My assessment of evidence adduced this far there is a clear case of corruption. why not go straight to court and lets the culprits face music i avail myself that is as a new friend lets concentrate on inquiry guys Hello Xolani Hence my position Thuso that we go straight to court.
Ziyanda Filita,so many people are going to be implicated here
Sabelo Thobani Masuku,their trying to make us forget about LAND
Keneilwe Mmutlana,We havent forgotten about LAND
thando cezula,Maseko is level headed The land is coming...thieves must also go to jail Phantsi nge Hawks phantsi! Uyaxoka Marvel! What about Agliotti? What about Brett Kebble? Those were not blacks! Hawks were used as a bulldozing machine by Zuma loyalists People had their names reputations dragged through the mud because they were incorruptible Captain Masilela must come take the stand Berning Ntlemeza must come before the enquiry as well! Thuso Ramaphosa will effect investigations believe me! Even now we know that Hawks are compromised! Indeed these criminals must be paraded in front of the whole country Guys do you think Zuma will ever take the stand? White taxpayer's money? That would be the best and most fulfilling piece of television! Witch hunt!!! Because Zuma was in charge Duze! He was never going to implicate himself by establishing such an inquiry! My preconception comes from the fact that the Guptas landed on Waterkloof! You can't land on Waterkloof without the clearance of the highest political office bearers! LOL David please don't insult my intelligence Friends of the state?
Kgutsang Setloboko,Ajay was the main character😁 @Van Heerden you always watching
sendo sityebi,ey guys are like women u talk'n'eat u gud at multitasking yho
Sibongiseni Maseko,Bring back the scorpions because these hawks are useless
Kristi Borton,Zaza
Mogau Tsetsewa,Scorpions were out immediately Zuma became an President
rendani siphoro,we need to go through cross examination to identify gap and lawyers always do root cause analysis not go straight to the point
Thuso Blessing,I need New Friends 😃 Thando are you special? I don't even think that the report of this inquiry will be taken serious. Just like others. waste of tax money I have to believe you Comrades
Willem Perold,knock knock
Dan Bourne Yeshurun,hey bring back the scorpions.. simple hawks are involved in heists and turning blind eye on ANC hitmen thuso we must see convictions ANC started the Hawks. All roads lead to ANC high profiled witnesses this year?????😳 thando. there will be a lot of throat clearing you all are moving too fast. when was it said that Zuma will take the stand? lol ace was there Cathren it was a Bond that was an older different Gupta in Mbekis cabinet might have been legit tho. no ill reports those ministers must be dealt with those useless ones that howl for supper in parliament "personally Cathren I don't get you """coloured"".. but her ancestors were colonizers" "today you can say you are a ""honey badger""" no need to educate me. I never called anyone black... and I used quotes by the way so thanks David they still have the economy as overwhelming majority of land. they didn't end up too bad you need to read a book on etymology then.. because colonizers knew that black really means NON person so thank you oneazania please stop black is a modernized title... but I did say look up the etymology "oneazania don't play semantics with me. if you wanna educate ppl true marvel. I'm done ???..... davids I think he is grandstanding here because he didn't recognise constructive advice 😂😂 back to the inquiry "when someone puts a seed in an egg lol if you can say black then you can say pink but you stared it😂😂 blf ADEC ADEC✊ Holomisa is Savage on candid cam 😂 bye guys
Xolani Mkhize,THUSO IM AM AVAILABLE BERNARD............? OF COURSE WE ARE WATCHING THE INQUIRY NJE ? I DONT KNOW ! I WAS NOT AWARE ! IM NOT SURE ! THAT IS WHAT JZ WILL SAY MARVEL what about MBUYISENI ?
Harry Garry,hi everyone

Eric Khoza,"At the end of the commission Men in suits with ties are far morre lethal than tsotsi's at the corner of the street at night.
Victor Mkhaliphi,WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAWYER?????
Miranda Valashiya,The was never the Hawks. They were Zuma's informant. That is why nothing was done to MAGASHULE about the dairy MATTER. CIC knew them before and he warned Zuma But he never listened. because they were same WhatsApp group.
Sam Thembani,yah nee
Lorna Kavanagh,yes Zuma was in charge Duze. JZ needed to keep Guptas happy

J Ganasan,Why are there so many bald men at participating at this hearing Are there any honest ANC leaders "@onenation - really sad. A country with so much potential  Leaders were not strong or principled enough Why are you guys discussing black or white ? Corruption is corruption . Are you trying to feel better about yourselves if a white politician was also involved ?

Nduduzo Zondi,is Maseko a pipe smoker...I can share some potent high grades....
Joseph J,Bottom line is white people will never work equally with black people they have programmed themselves to think that they own africa. The only way ti deal with them is through armed conflict. We can win we have to fight really hard look at Vietnam in the 70s america had better weapons and tech. but the Vietnamese were still victorious. the only way to get them out it through armed and bloody conflict eff eff eff @ryan castle your rhetoric Zimbabwe was forced into economic proverty by sanctions from European countries they were never given a fair playing field. "@ryan castle white people automatically assume that we cannot run our own states because we are ""stupid"" but the truth is European powers will not allow it." "@ryan caged go back to europe and help their economy. black people care about freedom more than money. whites will never admit that they want blacks to be their slaves @ryan castle your lame talking points im in america and the first thing a racist says when he is exposed is he has black friends. if you have black friends then your friendship is inherently abusive @ryancastle black supremacy in numbera not in power for whites still own most of the land. stop lying to the world and yourself. but we will shiw you black supremecy really soon when we have land @ryan cage armed conflict is the only answer we must give our blood like the Vietnamese did to rid you oppressive sneaky snakes from our motherlands
