Aubrey De Bliquy,It will be great if Trump exposes the banana republic fiasco that is American elections for decades. Did anyone seriously think these parasites were going to let Trump win? LOL Hey Alta What did I miss? @Val Speirs Did you check the vote breakdown.?Trump got a greater proportion of African American support than any republican ever in history. People ain buyingwhat the zombie left are selling. I think there was skirting of the regulations at Denel because of the specialized market and management did so knowingly and discretely with government consent for business not corrupt reasons. It was a consensus of the collective. LOL @Tickle McVetkoek LOL He is saying that there was a long standing practice of skirting the law in Denel because of the specialized nature of the industry. If she dissented she was the dissenting minority on exco mabe she never told him because she perceived him as the champion of these deviations from the regulations. OK That is the commissions mandate. Find the facts. Not judge ayone. That is the problem with centralized collective policy. The collective can't dictate the market or the law they are subject to. It is regrettabky the nature of democracy that any little idiotic idea can grow up to become national policy. @Heather Durr Like superman. Trump fell on his head when he was a baby and is now immune to brain damage. Maybe that is why he did less evil than Obama or Bush where can I apply for a job with the Guptas. I want a ticket to the gravy train. @SanFran Arnold They defer to a UN critique of their vehicles safety. "Never forced them - if they dont do as I say fire the and get someone else to do it How could not be serious if he resisted the CEO. excuses it was like he was sleepy yestrday "Do people defending Zuma by demonizing so called ""clever blacks"" ot see how self deprecating their argument is?u" I think the best strategy is for whites to join the AN en masse and hold them to the freedom charter starting with the land equity issue. We cannot have peace with vast gap betwen rich and poor. It is the problem of the collective US @Kgaogelo Zana After USA has been outed as the banana republic of all time Our corruption does not rise above petty crooks.. We are watching a rule of law USA does not have. The cup is half full. @johannes mailula Do you think the deep state was going to let Trump win after decades of fake rigged elections? Of course they would rig it against him. Look at the record turnout. @Pienaar van Wyk Hehehe Classic comment "He wasn't negligent "@zip reeper whats the ""H"" for?" @Tshifhiwa Elmon Madiba This commission is only a waste o money of you believe this corruption cannot be stopped and will continue ... If that is so we better arm ourselves for the jungle.. @LionView I think so because we have no choice but to fix this. We are at the dawn of the recession of the millenium. The NWO elite parasites have our destiny mapped out. @LionView It is a deep rabbit hole full of designed intrigue and obfuscation and disinfo and decoys that IMHO leaves us in one of the darkest ages -- mostly because we think we know it all. Often it is when man is most certain that he is most deluded. Hello @ALTA 😀 "And the reason is when you know all the answers you stop doing science @Alta. I may have been making coffee. Hehehe lovely to hide behind a collective board decision. "When we open our arms to 250000 immigrants a year Hi @Naledi Barron Youve been scarce. @Naledi Barron its11h00 in Cpe Town Thanks @Naledi Barron with milk no sugar and this collective guilt race card pulled against whites or blacks or whoever is not helpful and not accurate.

Is this his answer for real? @Anwar Syed DCJ tried to help Dudu to give her side of the story but she refused. He couldn't do much about her.

Anne M.,@lindi hlongwane That's somewhat of a broad question. What specifically do you want to know? Hello @ALTA 😘 "Dankie @ALTA Yes This Commission was set up to investigate corruption in state organisations @don luc @lindi hlongwane "Each advocate has their own style Did you see my earlier greeting @Pastor J.J ? @Hdg 20 Definitely. I will give him that - Ntshepe concedes certain points (possibly minor). More than what most others have done. Why is it a joke @KyleGreenZA ? Okay @KyleGreenZA . Whatever you say. Why are you watching it then? DCJ flabbergasted! @Krishan Shunmugam And that's the sad part. The number of people directly & indirectly affected by all this looting must run into tens of thousands. "Yes And day in and day out we hear more and more @R.m. B. Me too @Cilly Vos The patience DCJ has is phenomenal. @Rahab Takalo True @Pheladi Lamola And that group is getting bigger and bigger every day. "No @ALTA I think you're thinking of the farm murder that happened up north. Van Breda happened in the Western Cape.
Tommygun,"Sweet very...malleable... Question is did he know or have an inkling of what was happening? Was he really completely cluless...in which case he is clueless. You women dont need anyone (men) to stand up for you in this forum. Y'all great communicators mostly. "@Luna but they shldnt have been fired? CHarges were trumped up Mr Ntshepe happy to be a rider and punch tickets on the runaway train that was Denel & VRLazer. "@zip reeper Ja The removed board members were anti transformation.... Small oversights by many people lead to HUGE errors. Id speculate they had no real evidence... Did he get a wedge of cash when he resigned? Problem is you need to allow some flexibility in running a business and you hamstring it with too much regulation and assuming all are trying to rip you off. Tricky balance. he also paid 1m to Supras son for flying lessons out of Denels cash He just wanted to be mr popular rather than unpopular.

Do not even get me started with the EFF @elton van neel Not very surprising. Biden has been on the news (Breaking news) for like the past week or so. How many times do we hear of Mabuza. Easy to even forget he exists. @ Abraham Varghese. CEOs simply instruct PAs to keep/file documents. Their responsibility isto takedecisions Liar caught out! Ntshepe must simply admit he was given instructions to “bend rules”. No need for him to admit that he got a cut . Only political pressure. @Zweli MxhegoBefore 1994 Gupta criminals had no chance in apartheid SA as “non whites’. After 1994 they were given a chance as “blacks” (They call it BEE) .

Why only Guptas related companies were given businesses with all South African SOEs? Very suspicious or not? A Group CEOs job is to keep documentation?? Not part of any decision making. political appointments will never save any country. Life style audits and all bank transactions are more than enough to nail these corrupted CEOs. All SOEs were running like that. That is why our country reached at this present situation. Want to move the Denel forward to where ?To the present situation? South Africa want to see proper actions to be taken to the corrupted and all lost money must come back to the treasury. Tax payers already contributed almost 1Bn rand for the commission's work. just of blood pressure and blood sugar people don't resign. They will take medication. Accept that mistakes are made means admission of guilt. Punishable offence. State can recover the money. no.1 Qns Done.
