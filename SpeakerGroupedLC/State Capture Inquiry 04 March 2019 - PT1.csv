Neil Fraser,How difficult can it be to name a file correctly? Surely you arrive an hour earlier to ensure that they match? File drama continues 15 minutes in and still trying to sort out files and index You'd think by now someone would be put in charge to get it right "Thando - Sincedile Shweni

Carl Theunissen,Torture on a Monday morning. We are all being re-programmed by the aliens. "#fuzile dazana is that the advocate? Shame @Felix Muyoba The management of Eskom warned the government still in the time of Mbeki that they should start to build more power stations. They didn't listen. Mbeki later said government was wrong. "Have you read that article But it was the guys at Eskom who told Mbeki to to build more power stations?? It was the ANC government that didn't want to! I don't understand your bonuses story. Mabuza is happy that there are people like Felix that fall for their stories. "@Jack Sparrow I'm agreeing with you - my comment starting with ""But it was the guys"" was aimed at Felix. Can't stand DT "Electricity is rather pressing @Tommy Anderson don't start with this nonsense. Bye bye Tommy. Blocked! "Correct @Bridgette Kekana! These people can only sing one song. Bla

Lucky Mduduzi Mabaso,RFP Request For Proposal
Francoise Phillips,Why is the SABC not broadcsting these commissions live on tv and radio? The public deserves full and free access to these shocking revelations. Time we start calling loadshedding what it really is: black outs. Time we call state capture what it is: ANC looting of our state. So this should really be a commission on inquiry into how the ANC looted our state.
Dams daily motivations Madamalala,mokgoro is a little bundles of state capture These cover all the Aspects of state
Vuyo Mfecane,Volume please
lindokuhle mbanyana,Yes South Africa is going to change bit by bit even though the will be people who will be corrupt and this eskom thing is killing our economy
Lawrence Maswabi,Just tuned in after being loadshed. Thanks to Eskom
Stephan Dolk,something smells of BS
Felix Muyoba,I for one think loadshedding is apartheid product because the capacity of eskom was just designed for the few and now the masses also want energy and therefore the capacity is insufficeint.. @JS Bach and @Joel Mzayidume you guys are wrong!! @Jack Sparrow those guys who ran it (eskom) then were short sighted..they were not following the strat plan..all they were interested in are bonuses.. @Joel Mzayidume no man..factual incorrect.. @Jack Sparrow understood but what happened to the profits eskom accummulated before then? why didnt they use that to expand eskom capacity instead of asking gvt? remember gvt has other more pressing social responsibilities to attend to @Joel Mzayidume you see people like @Tommy Anderson.. @Tommy Anderson you are blerry racist then you should go and live on another planet! "@Tommy Anderson the problem with you is that you have lost your privileges and therefore angry at that..forget about that era everybody has rights..the problem is that not everyone has privileges @Tommy Anderson @AFRICA AZANIA agree
Jack Sparrow,"@Felix Muyoba Nope. Eskom generates less electricity now than they did then but don't let facts get in the way of your predjudice @Felix Muyoba In 1998 Eskom predicted that demand would outstrip supply in 2008. The ANC was too busy feeding at the trough to take notice. And then in 2008 we ran out of juice @JS Bach But you can't deny that Donald Trump was caused by apartheid @Felix Muyoba any build programme would be subject to approval by the government. Eskom couldn't go it alone "@Frik Brits we're blaming apartheid for everything @Tommy Anderson to donald trump @Eslon Eslon ...and Mabuza is just one heartbeat away from president
Joel Mzayidume,@JS Bach you're right. it's ANC's fault @Felix Muyoba what is stated by @JS Bach is recorded fact. @Felix Muyoba no problem stick with what you believe in. @Felix Muyoba how much profit was that? Remember Eskom was funding the electrification of black people's homes. New build required serious money from Treasury Sthule siyabuka nje
Melamu Izzo Mokoena,m
Tommy Anderson,SA government is finished under ANC Vote VF+ Apartheid was the best thing that happened "What nonesense My new campaigne: Malema must fall ANC will not deliver. Vote responsably JS Bach you have no power son "Of course I am SA lost all quality of government in 1994 We need a white only government to pull this country from the toilet and make it working again Who is the reason that we have business of the day like this? Don't tell me what to think little boy I have all the rights in the world Everything under ANC has failed EVERYTHING siviwe slara videos dont lie idiot Who is scared? People that can not live by rules Eskom NEVER had load shedding under white government FACT siviwe slara Are you thick upstairs? Like Malema? Eskom served the ones that did not steal electricity "Julius Malema is the biggest problem causer of our age "The fall of the ANC "If the blacks are so powerful "The ANC stole so much money that the government is crippled ALL of them are criminals "You had FREE education and electricity They clearly didnt get all the corrupt ones "And besides more farmers died in this era than blacks in apartheid. Apartheid was a front you used to get the international community's attention "The last 25 years was a lie and look for yourself what is happening. In order for something to be able to be broken down "They shouldnt have stopped with Hani Just like thorn Malema And Andile "You are in such denial nothing can change your pathetic points of view "Thank you "In order for south africa to move forward "Secondly to change the government to honest hard working people Thirdly we must get the 4000 farms the ANC is sitting on that are unproductive working again by WHITES that have the know how Fourthly bring back the death sentence "If there where honest people in government Vote VF+ I would have had D Zuma hung if I where president ALL the Zumas I would have taken out all the thorns "The ANC and EFF and BLF is all talk Vote VF+ "siviwe slara I agree "The only way forward is to remove the cancer that is still poisoning this country "Thando Nkutha You have no power "I speak truth into power No the DA is rubbish "It might not happen at the ballot boxes "You have many things to say No its openly "Reuben Trotter Exactly "National Party was a mistake like de Klerk Canaverde2 Thats the truth! Bridgette Kekana Waiting ... "Im still here "If they can only see the solution Too many years eating pap and smoking in shacks have limited the abilities to see and to think "I am a racist I dont cover up what I feel by blaming other of my own mistakes "The Zondo Commission is talking on behalf of a board of directors "No solid conclusions will be reaches here today That is a valid suggestion yes They should be tried in the High Court "Yes its true "Yose Human Not all whites brought indians in as sugar cane slaves "If you deny this "Our team never lost "To all South Africans

Brenda Hughes,Tommy #blocked
Reuben Trotter,Would anyone just give up what they have come to accept as theirs? Casting blame at the past does not deal with the present challenges. The reality has to be dealt with. It really seems as if there isn't a real will to solve this issue.
Canaverde2,The SABC is working just as well as ESKOM and the government. I admire the patience of Justice Zondo with these second rate advocates!

mmasechaba tsakane nkuna,Hello √ó----
Nivan N,have to say something . . . how on earth can a ONE MAN (Zondo Commission) come to any conclusion in this SAGA . . . This is a TOTAL waste of Time & Money. The commission is working off SIU reports that these people have made years ago . . why through a commission . . . this should all be tested in the Highest Courts with a Panel . . . not a ONE MAN sho @Tommy . . . not just today . . .
