Akhona Gala,His voice is gone already "Zwane is a fake heartless comrade :elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: As I was told chair 😂 why didn't you go to those details? Hi Ace:goodvibes: @Thobani Mkandla lol Akhonamandla Gala not Gasa yes my friend lol @Thobani Mkananda sorry for spelling your surname Nkandla lol "lol SABC Live chat is very active today @abc Stripsils aka Medikeel 😂😂Zondo is in with a Vosho!!! "@Musa Mabunda 😆 he seems to forget that he's under oath look at the sign language lady when signing the Database:washhands: @Yolo More lol 😂let's see how long is he going to remember 😂Zwane uyaxoka yhooo mfondini 😂aai Zwane 😂Pretorious is wiser than him 😂getting edgy now
Lindani Moyo,Seems he already has a potato in his mouth Can someone prepare diapers for Zwane please @Thobani Mkananda He is going to need them ASAP @Thobani Mkananda I withdraw Honorable Chair. He can't even look at the Chair Hi ACE @Thobani Mkananda Please prepare diapers for Zwane. It's getting hot here Zwane is confident now. He can even look at the chair. Zwane has won the morning. We thought he was going to break. He has stood his ground unfortunately. Zwane has won the day "Stealing in the name of people Zondo is a bit polite when it comes to high ranking politicians
OS Muzik,"""If I know "I really want to see how the DCJ deals with him "The ANC takes the responsibility for honourable individuals in the organisation Too much alluding Mr.Z! "Everyone is at fault here! Starting with the human settlements minister down Companies have their own skeletons which they hide! Tired Mr. Zwane? Stop delaying and this could be over sooner! @Rox The commission needs to submit recommendations by end of March! I expect Zondo may ask for an extension. Then there will be a commission of enquiry into the Zondo Commission! "Shamilla Batohi needs to set up different investigative units
Maxwell Sibiya,"I'm trying to be like ' ahh He will probably suffer from amnesia all day long. but I'm excited his here I don't remember. It was not me. That's not True. etc.... Can someone give him a 2 litre of water. Eish... work work work. I'm gonna have to rewind this.
Douglas Masuku,"Mr. ""You will walk next to your shoes""." This will be a tough but to crack @Thabang I think Zwane is wrong to think he can hide behind the lower Officials. He is the political head who has oversight. He could have sought legal advice. @Mbuso We can still see his shoes😉😉 @ Keegan A LOOTER continua "@Mondli Abv. Pretorius has already emasculated Mr. Zwane. He made major concession this morning. It's going to be downhill from here. This man in now the one ""walking next to his shoes """ "Ace will come and do ""Quantity Easing"" with the commission" The witnesses looks like Duduzane. is he not?? There will be no further extensions to Zobdo @Thembisa. it will be down to the wire. Zondo will focus on the main looters to make the deadline Quite right Pula. SaPOona???
Mike Newlands,I cant lie I really did not think he would pitch up Amani suit BMWX5 and all - but there he is ! Can I greet all the liars & thieves watching at Lootfreely House - enjoy - although you have stolen SA blind & destroyed our SA😠 -at least we the poor have some satisfaction in watching you squirm😀 @Craig Johnson This guy one of ANS's top dog liars in parliament- lied when he said cabinet had approved comm of enquiry lied when he said did not Switzerland to do Gupta's bidding @Craig Johnson I agree he is fed up "ANC Liars in parliamnt Lynne Brown "@Carmen James ""not wait I did steal but apardhied made me do it""" @Craig Johnson 😀 "Its time these ANC thieves just said :yes I stole the peoples money  Is anybody at Lootfreely House watching this and saying where did we the once great ANC go wrong? Probably not! I wonder if the 100 subsitance farmers he cheated out of a trip to China for training in dairy farmers are watching? He took all his friends instead in thier place. Unbelievable If anybody wants to understand the corruption in the ANC NEC and Lootfreely Hse- buy ACE MAGASHULE THE GANGSTER STATE. book and be very scared @Canis Africanis more than we can afford! @teboho ramolotsi But crime does pay have you seen any of the thieves from the president downwards in jail? That is why our country is broke Zwana & friends are living proof Did he actually take the oath? @Elton Josea well he just has to lie his way thru this commission then his life goes on he knows nobody in the ANC go to jail sadly a minor inconveniance for this liar! "@MM G well it is - but at least we know why we are unemployed Who thinks the ANC will lose Joburg & Tswane next year? @a b c Fair coment but these a the metros and generally people are well informed. Not as the rural areas @Xolani J Masemula Mmmm I agree to apoint but the DA/EFF unseated them for a while a big no vote wpuld would put ANC out @Hlemphe Abiel Semelane well we keep voting them in so we only have ourselves to blame. @Rubin Naidoo he was very responsible he treated hinself to a maroon Masarati as a reward @Rubin Naidoo I am serious he had the same colour as Tony Yengeni - who was convicted of drunk driving (for the 3rd time) in CT in his Masarati. He had a wihite one before that -I think Ace's 2 sons have a least one Fararri between them! @Canis Africanis well that is there job- sadly its not broadcast on the TV channels thus the poor who really need to see the ANC thieves in action @Phillip Cwazibe I knew of one but of course they would have one each ! @Phillip Cwazibe wonder what all the ANC NEC members have hidden under tarpaulin in there garagaes "@Andre Ackerman The Hawks only arrest who the ANC tells to arrest @Precious Ntshangase exactly I remember when the ANC MP's clapped and shouted thier support when Zuma killed off the scorpions-they now new they could steal unhindered and they did "@Owen Nyilika well ""the ANC steals in billions not millions "" to quote thier own minister Gordhan" @Michael Wild 😂 i hope so but he knows no matter how guilty lootfreely house is behinf @Michael Wild behind him Ever wondered why every province is bankrupt & corrupt except the WESTERN Cape now we know why @Thulani Sokhela we expected the apardheid government to be thieves we did not well i did not expect the anc to be worst! @Ismail Petersen Hey Ismail dont send him to our prison we only take high class liars thieves & criminals this piece of crap needs to go to sewerage dept in Joburg and do time there. "@Mandla J Ngubeni & the money they steal goes to Cuba for holidays and europe giving emplyment to europeans who build tFararis

Christopher Peters,"Mornings wow we have another guest @OS Muzik DCJ should have kept that speech for Zwane Kickoff What position does Zwane hold currently? Tx saing lots of words meaning nothing. lol ouch prepared to throw officials Lies do not have an origin. "This is the first point They decided Mr Mokwoena must take the fall. Is this a opportune time? Tokio told him that it was illegal. he will not mention the name of the Premier. Going to Saxonworld is not a sin anymore. "@Simba dont want to put him in the room where HOD signed. He does not know the PFMA Gonna run "dont allow him chair Did they resume? Dit is hartseer He does not know any of those Acts. None of them do "This is why officials win all labour disputes This is the same person who threatened somebodies livlihood. lol geeezzz Surely CR can chase him out of parliament now. and now? Pathetic he did not want that. lol sy kollegas gaan hom dood maak. "He cared about the people Remember these thugs thought that Zumas reign will never end. So it was never necessary to clean up their Acts. 1652 never happened @Eric Sithole Expensive muppit. had to go procure money at Estina. @Cerebis very funny Mr Allooted Mr Allooted "Enjoy your weekends
Mandla J Ngubeni,Hope he will tell the truth "These guys are heartless Blame shifting game as usual As I was told by who? This thing of political deployment has brought us here as a country I understand Zwane was just a mere teacher "The commission is now getting to its climax This guy sounds intelligent but why didn’t he bother to familiarize himself with the law This war room thing came with Zuma’s regim I was also wondering the whereabouts of Maleka "The stupid thing about this looting Now he has no way out How can give somebody such a high portfolio who has no clue what’s happening You right Peter He is now exposed and embarrassed Not knowing the law is not an excuse in a court of law "When he was advised to stop illegal process Now he is in trouble 🧐 Uhleka nton ngempela

Zackes Makae,Morning.. hopefully Mr. Zwane will remember something today because it seems like all the skelems don't remember anything "after Zwane we want his father ""Ace Magashule to come answer too" his mother is ZULU and his father SOTHO so you both have him
Lehlohonolo Lekhoasa,i so wish NPA can speedly arrest this people
Vuyisile Ngesi,Mosebenzi truth is going to be forgotten Saxonworld curry messed up his voice but further messed up the memory memory loss in action so early This is the same guy who went to Switzerland to negotiatte the Gupta mining deal... DCJ tearing into Zwane's lies... DCJ slowly roasting a liar...
Fred Desrosiers,"@Connie Mose the best one was the witness who could not even remmember his wedding anniversary told by whom? "Is ""as I was told"" the new ""I do not recall""???" oh oh. trowing low level people under the bus. @Noel Nel. I think we will get to that point. There is nothing in the PFMA of a database. is there a proof of the instructions given to him? uhhh. both of them should be put in the same jail cell ok. 2nd person under the bus. accounting officer "yep. go DCJ he should quit now before he gets roasted Mokoena should look to see how many times the bus rolled over him today. Zwane is determined to blame Mokeona "Can someone describe the war room please do not sit on the sidelines. many people here should run for office please also businesses like Eskom should not be run by government

I'm just concerned that we won't hear one another @Philip Cwazibe It's both means Msebenzi: Work and Worker @Philip Cwazibe Indeed.

Now he's crying foul as if the commission is thumb-sucking the very piece he quoted repeatedly in the morning How much does this Zwane know about the PFMA? @Michael Holmes That's my conclusion as well.

The smile on his face is an insult to the public and the commission @Tee_R The Chef Order comrade 🤣😂 "Why doesn't he answering questions directly though? He just talked about ""activities"" now the chair is asking if those activities are a new point or pertinent..." Sapuna is subpoena 😂🤣
Val Speirs,Zwane sounds choked and looks intense and nervous. "Ask the question "" Why did they allow the tender process to collapse""?" Why is it that Zwane the MEC does not know the law? There was an intended fraudulent purpose to allow the proper Tender procurement process to expire. Zwane does not even know the regulations he has to follow ..quite convein How was Zwane appointed he knows nothing is unqualified 🙈 Officials must now tell the MEC how to do his job 😳 ANC aboard the gravy train. The bottom line is a lack of qualified Ministers and Officials who are totally incompetent. "Leave Trump out of this

He looks like a man abandoned by all his friends... "a minister who says ""Togeda"" is automatically part of that other guys group who left school in Standard 2" He looks like a man abandoned by all his friends... he's strangely acceeding to many serious questions Is this guy Zulu or sotho? Or is his just corrupt? @anchor hahaha @anchor looks like any response to weather he's Zulu or sotho is retracted lol "@ Phillip. Very true and strange.

a b c,I was gonna say that this guy's gonna get cooked... but it sounds like the curry already cooked his throat for us... He's sweating from the chilli in the curry he had this morning Ace... you seemed to have told this guy a lot of stuff "Hi Ace... could I have some of your money please Yeah this mango doesn't look ripe... If you listen carefully you can hear the fire slowly starting to crackle for Strepsils here... Strepsils should just tell the truth... @Xolani 😅😅 @Akhona 😅 lol Lol he's a follower of Bushiri now...?? @Yolo More 😅 Lol @Canis I don't think oath means anything to these people... "If we got a rand for every time we heard ""database"" today..." @Anchor 😂😂 It's rough out there "This ""smooth criminal"" be moonwalking his way to jail soon..." So it's settled then... Norman is definitely related 😂😂 "Yip... I read his answer as ""Yes... we're definitely related""...lol" Only if people are sufficiently informed of the ANC's incompetence @Mike Clark They replaced the guy playing online chess with this lady... 😅😅😅 Look guys... anothet person wh wishes they were American Go pillay in the park Kumaran... this ain't America...

Wasn't he supposed to do 4 years? It's been 26 years Thulani... we have new issues to deal with... You hear that ANC? Give Botes his last bread back! Nah Mike... don't send him our side... let him go to KZN... Gauteng doesn't want him.. Tge problem though is we get old Thabo back for about a few weeks before he kicks the bucket from stress... he's an old timer you know... 😅 "Though I'm curious I think I'd rather vote for Mickey Mouse than the EFF... at least mickey won't make things worse... "@Xolani yeah bro... that's actually the answer I usually get Civil war is unlikely... the most likely occurrence is usually civil unrest... war is a pretty big word... @xolani true that I heard Zwane made a break for it... I'm cool with Pretorius handling this one No they're just trying to find Zwane who's probably slipped through a bathroom window by now... "Reporters say that Zwane was like ""Screw this"" and run out the door" *ran Oh there he is... Yeah he knows... that's why he's smirking... We have incompetent ministers in power people He shouldn't have had all that curry last night... Someone better get down there and give Dry-Throat a pack of Strepsils... Lol That's what happens when you're appointed based on connection rather than qualification @Christopher Peters I don't think that Bushiri wristband is saving him right now... Lol he's not being intimidated... he is just being asked questions... Zwane could open a bakery with all these waffles... Lol he had no idea what he was doing! Didn't even know of the act... Lord have mercy... Oh my... it really makes you wonder about the other ministers... So even the legal officials were clueless?? @Alan I'll get the truck ready @jwarha21 eish It's very shocking chair Waffling again... Where did they go...? SABC you lack focus sometimes... @Craig Johnson oh lol @Yolo More hahaha... always appreciated my friend 😅 @Deborah I don't think he'll admit that he has a degree in lying and stealing But we all know what the worst part is... not much will be done about this That's the thing... there aren't many real consequences to this... But how many of 'em were built? @Melvern tell me about it... Pretorius called him out on this nonsense... Which people Deborah? Be careful what you wish for... new people does not always mean better... This is just going on and on... Lol... Jan van Reibeck has entered the conversation He wouldn't be laughing if there were actual consequences to this whole thing We're getting nowhere with this cookie... we can see he's incompetent...there doesn't seem to be more to it... The real heroes will be those who put criminals in jail... The type of water that makes you talk nonsensw

I will carry the job title on my shoulders but not the responsibilities that come with it. The remuneration is fine with me though. Such is the calibre of our leaders in this country. The question to this man should be: What was your understanding of your own job? "Typical of politicians who don’t consider themselves Is this the guy who took members of a church choir to India?

What an embarrassment. You'd think the ANC would learn but they always appoint this kind of people. You're absolutely right @Craig Johnson. But Ramaphosa is doing the same. Bheki Cele doesn't belong anywhere near ministries. Mapisa Ngqakula.🤦‍♀️ He never read anything. Mokoena should've recorded Zwane when he was threatening him. I was thinking the same thing @Precious Ntshangase. He could've given away mining right for 5 cents since he never read anything. Sorry @Kumaran Pillay. Wecan't help you with your wish. I agree with you Lindani Pretorius is getting old. Zwane didn't answer why he didn't attend that meeting They're back. I just checked eNCA. Bye He's not aware of it even in 2020. We are led by fools I wonder how he left this municipality he keeps referring to. I think we need to introduce CPD to these politicians. Mandatory CPD. @Lucas Maloka I used to say I wouldn't even wash my car with that T-shirt Side note: Are these guys not allowed to take off their jackets? "You would think so DCJ.

Itumeleng Dikobe,Zwane is trying to spin a lie and nothing is catching. Dom Dommer Dommest. But look at the smirk on his face when clarity is seemed. "Wait wait wait
Ayanda Diliza,The evidence leader is roping him in slowly. Zwane's illusiveness will crumble when the assault begins. now we're getting close to the 'war room'. The assault is about to begin He's not clueless. He knew exactly what he was doing. He would rather use ignorance as a WEAK defense than to admit his role in the looting. The investigators can prove if he knew about the Housing Act before April 2010. They only need to go through govt bulletins during that period. The commission can still prove his perjury; especially regarding claiming not to know about the housing act. "Zwane's favorite song is ""It wasn't me"" by Shaggy"

Does Zwane know that there are In-Year Monitoring monthly meetings in the departments which track progress of the implementation processes? Or in Free State that is not the case? Zwane can't claim tiredness now when he was never tired of looting for over 10 years What stupidity is this of an MEC not aware of imminent withdrawal of funds from his dept yet he drinks whiskey with national minister at looting parties? Possibly there was bad blood between them. These people in power will someday not remember they were in government and looted resources. I so wish their existential history would be erased as well. They're a disgrace to the majority of SAns. What nonsense is Zwane saying to say he doesn't recall responding to the minister's letter. On coming back Zwane must do the Mokonyane.
