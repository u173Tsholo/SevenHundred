You are rit no one can tell the correct answer "if that will be must get support from his mps we can not blame Ramaphosa cause all the Mps who surrounding are corrupt but remember they can point you if they see that their plans are failed David Cele is rit
carnoth ngomane,@Sindiswa Moolman I shall wait to be seen @Thami Nobela why are the mp's divided? @Thami Nobela Clearly you cant substantiate you facts let leave you to it @Thami Nobela no it is not and JZ & ACE are the principal reasons for the disunity @Raven Penny i have been grappling with that question as well "@Josias Maluleke thats their major drawback "discordance "People are advised not to vote for the ANC with reasons @Cerebis indeed its all about ANC "@Derek Main Thanks you @Derek Main Ethnicity & populism play a huge role in our election and the will make it hard to oust the ANC @Suicidal Animal what prompted your question?
Mbombi,"hi everyone thanx Ann what invoice are referring to wat invoice are they referring too il be be back I'm going to download the memorial service of Gavin Watson "Ramaphosa is the weakest ANC President Bcos he doesn't have control of ANC NEC ANC is so decided under Rama even Mp's are divided no one is blaming anyone here I was just stating the truth "those Mp's belong to ANC "ANC as a whole is decided. from Branches divided you should be asking why ANC members are devided there was never Unity to begin with brb Ngomane is the ANC United? this live chat reminds me of mig33 üòè "not just ANC "Pastors are corrupt
Raven Penny,pipe dreams the fight back is already ousting cr 17 there is nothing that the anc Wil do to the anc yes but his between a rock and a train agree agree this country wil take long time to recover that's the problem because they were never United just pray for a better sa no the culture this things go long back agree who wil come after if they fall what monster wil arise i he's to young to be the main guy just a fall guy no hang on there's more money to steal dololo they wil never stop voting for anc the anc was once a glorious movement just greed what is better yes i agree are you beki celes son the lost one i fully agree anc supporters don't want to see the truth anc supporters are being told that apartheid wil come back so wrong food parcels at the service have a safe and blessed wkend
Pastor J.J,@david cele And your dog died toooo @david cele But no stress David. U and I are still alive @david cele I can get you a brand new dog. Its a pitbull @david cele We can name him Ryan ja Do we really have an Honest Political Party and/or Politician? @Derek Main Your statement makes a lot of sense. However they got it very wrong in NMB
Eugene,hello hi brother's and sisters that's struggling in South Africa South Africa has a mental health problem. It's not a crime problem. Apartheid. lawd like affirmative action and black economic empowerment is clear signs of apartheid. who are the mentally disabled? The black people that do get degrees do get jobs.... just not in South Africa who wants a war in South Africa? do you want a civil war in SA? replay yes or no
SENZO MABASO,"Crime; Corruption
Kung Fu Kenny,Floyd Shivambu must pay the 1.5 Million he stole from VBS pension funds haha 1.8* @Amos Tjiane Ramaphosa himself is also corrupt. @david cele Not floyd? then must be a fake article
Hein Schreiber,Apollo Grand available on the Google Play Store. Go have a look!
Tappies Smit,They are devided because after all the commissions..DOG eat DOG..hehehehe zuma tries to steal the copper in the cables to sell it to pay Hanekomr spoton Onkabetse !! Then we all are moertoe..we are not far from that anyway Judge Zondo is showing that this man was not fit to do his job. ANC people vote for the anc and then strike and set everything alight and destroy infrustructure and then again vote for anc. the anc are failing every South African..finish and klaar. I agree david.. The Watsons were never on the side of black people..they became rich by stealing from the poorest of the poor cANCer policy in schools are PASS ONE PASS ALL... Apartheid will never come back...to me it is dead..I dont socialize with people who believe in any form of apartheid Then that is anc apartheid.. The cANCer will struggle for the next 300 years..they dont have the ability to move on Dont answer a fool regarding a war
Nonzy,hahaha. the copper thingy is funny DA and EFF could have neutralized the ANC but both parties have too much pride. Just dismantling the power like they have done in taking over the metros
Onkabetse Seatlholo,South Africa is a mafia state under the leadership of a corrupt president and corrupt anc. spot on cele our people must stop to vote this useless corrupt anc i support your view cele this inquiry waste time and taxpayers money as nothing will happen to those who are exposed by the inquiry i don't talk about watching it barbara tell me Barbara what is the purpose of having the enquiry?
makhosi nobhatyi,Now this witness voice is getting away humble to lie @David cele you sound like ben10 now I guess you were born in this democracy so you don‚Äôt understand I did read your statement it‚Äôs an insult to me and disgraceful "Valence Watson says Agrizzi is a pathological liar
Josias Maluleke,"@Bedazzled DA & EFF have no policies except to insult the ANC "@Carnoth Ngomane They simply do not have anything to say about the country's issues hence the insults @david cele vote for who? "@Derek Main not holding fort for any political party all I say is opposition parties must come up with progressive
Ntuthuko Buthelezi,Please name one anc policy that they have implemented and change the lifestyle of black people
Gareth Davies,@david celle. It‚Äôs the law.
Blaze 613,"I am voting anc next time anc does a better job than apartheid...viva anc
phemelo seothaeng,Yes we will not stop voting ANC . "Insulting my parents won't assist you with anything wena David Cele  "David Cele you must be smoking nyaope David Cele my parents are extremely poor and they are not corrupt.
barbara broadbent,We need the daily entertainment!!! "Onkabetse
Neville Watson,The ANC really run this country to the ground with incompetent thieves "Incompetence play a big role 
Lindythefinest,david cele you are very foolish
Derek Main,@Onkabetse Seatlholo I agree - the ANC is corrupt to the core. @Josias Maluleke At least they are not as corrupt as the ANC - the ANC has perfected corruption. Everything else they touch turns to s**t. @Blaze 613 Then you're a fool - just like all the other ANC voters. @Josias Maluleke How many party manifestoes have you looked at? "@Josias Maluleke Besides @carnoth ngomane UDM - Holomisa has shown time and again in parliament that he is the voice of reason. There I've done it. @Raven Penny That's just yet another ANC BS story. @Cerebis I agree with you. Not sure what other factors are at play there but Bobani is very suspect. "@carnoth ngomane Exactly. And let me just say @Josias Maluleke Surely those people should have realised by now that the ANC makes many promises but doesn't keep them?
mafuta,agreed @makhosi nobhatyi . How does a camera lie ?
Naledzani Mashau,"You are right David
clive oconnell,News today ‚Äî Only 6% have a passmark of over 60% at mathematics in SA universities. What chance SA future in worldwide economy
Cerebis,"In this and other commissions "@Derek Main Agree SABC.....Will Cloudy come? "I had high hopes for UDM and Cope @Suicidal Animal Anybody that wants a war in SA is mad and evil
Lee D. Hendrix,....Naledzani Mashau‚Äã...That is the fact of outside governance the president. His venue is instructed from Europe.
