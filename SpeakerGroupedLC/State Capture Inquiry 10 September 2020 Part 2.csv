Mondli Nohashe,In my research. This old lady will be turning 62 on Monday (14). Zondo must excuse her now to relax. Every time a question is imposed she becomes more confused. "Ei ! It's going to be the end of the day . Guys we are fooled here  @ Elton everybody lieeven Baba lied Ngo Tsotsi aba bonke I said long ago. This is a movie. Nobody will be prosecuted here. Waste of tax money These all crooks "Waste of timee  "@ Frank  Nite Nite

Smart Guys,leave the chat makhosi
NOXOLO GUMEDE,Shoo this woman is extremely long winded! Not sure of her guilt or innocence.... But to me such behaviour constitutes a lot of shadiness. ABSA dodged a bullet when this gogo Venete Klein resigned. "Why does she like changing questions to suit her. Zondo asks what board's attitude was @PeterDolan totally agree with you. Zondo is extremely smart. Why did Eskon board settle on a year's salary on employees who weren't found guilty? "I think ABSA graciously requested she ""retire"" 😉 😉 as opposed to them exposing her incompetence! #VeneteKlein" #VeneteKlein loces her own view hey! How many times must she be told #StateCaptureInquiry requires board's view not her own. She's an arrogant fool! 😡 "As long as this Auntie is trying to justify herself "People like #VeneteKlein should be compelled to be questioned on ""close ended qustions"" requiring only YES or NO answers.... Else StateCaptureInquiry will continue till 2050!😡" I am grand sharp with this tanie shoo! 😡 #VeneteKlein kwaaa Kwaaaa Kwaaaa!!!! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Arme man wat sy is getroud met! He'll only get to sleep tomorrow at 4am...Shell be taking his ears off!
Mlungu Mkhonza,mhmmm great work from the team leader🙌🙌🙌 people are taking to people here
Mangalani Mangalani,@Supreme Monakeng Gerry Nel won as witnessed by conviction & sentence @Supreme Monokeng Who decides on stronger points? Your opinion or courts? @Melor Hadebe Thank you for clearing for him. Poor Judge Masepa was not aware of Dolos Entualis principle of law. I was embarrassed by her understanding. @Supreme Monokeng Pls go read on Dolos Eventualis @JONASNOBROTHER You premeditated murder & Dolus Eventualis are 2 different aspects! @Vanessa Van Vuuren When do I get the price?😂😂😂 @Supreme You don’t seem to understand how our legal system & sentencing work. SCA correctly indicated that Judge Masepa got it WRONG! Now you want to use some logic. We only have one legal system @Supreme Strength of argument is judged by courts and not hearsay or personal bias. JONASNOBROTHER State was fantastic. Hence they even forced Oscar (despite protests from Barry) to go mental hospital for a month. @Supreme I am afraid to burst your bubble. That is not true and you are free to check the transcript. BLR claimed the state of mind & GN forced mental examination & BLR protested. "@Supreme You got it wrong! BLR wanted to use that in “mitigation of sentence” and GN was smart enough to “steal that glory” from BLR. Hence @Supreme. You are not entitled to your facts. “Pistorius stood in the dock today to hear Judge Masipa say she would allow the state's application to have his mental condition assessed.” @Supreme They played a losing card and GN was SMART to understand they are on the defensive. "@Supreme By the way @Supreme No I am clear you have no legal understanding. Everyone is saying that based on Dolus Eventualis! @Supreme Correct because you are debating like a layman.
Harris Hlongwane,:thanksdoc::thanksdoc:
Zolile Dola,Mr Makhosi.so you mean Mr Tsotsi he is innocent he never get share on the money have been stolen with these Crooks? he just helped them to do what ever they wanted to do.
Ghost Mapetla,"What transpired did happen on its own What Baba says is correct wrong or write is clear he didnt share the same view with baba The reason is known by Mbai & Nkandla those were the orders of Baba and we must protect our leaders They could not wait for 3 weeks the real board didnt want that Some sold out but others didnt know Those who were axed are those who were perceived for the new game lo what did these this people agree to here Baba wanted it to happen like this NO questions Those who were axed are those who were perceived weak for the new game This are the soldiers we must die before we get Zuma and the Guptas The plan was to bring there people dark or blue Babas instruction and wishes were respected at the end and the gate of greed took over

climate124,It was not about what they were doing wrong.. it was that they were not doing anything "all this sweet language clothed in legal
Tay,She is a sweet talker and she easily diverts... @Thulie ABSOLUTELY The DCJ is very persuasive and has a way of extracting the truth... @Glynn you are spot on! She is cornered now yes Sweating and all struggling to concede... @Nokutenda Royal The old woman is lying too much I don't remember when I got married because I'm an African man @Gift Magano yes Doc that is a killer question... A settlement is payment after a dispute!!! I agree with you chair but at the time of making a decision it was the right decision. It CANT be! She FINALLY gave in This Advocate does not lose his composure at all... She is protecting baba Spot on DCJ! The DCJ wants her back tomorrow Yes I remember but I don't remember The Chairman is smelling blood Tannie is in a difficult position after asked to protect baba ...Context of directive from the top..

JONASNOBROTHER,"@Mangalani not withstanding judge Masepas possible misinterpretation of dolus eventualis @Mangalani they're definitely 2 very different concepts. let me rephrase for u. Even if we accept there was incorrect application of dolus eventualis by the judge the state did poorly to prove beyond reasonable doubt

Frank Jordaan,My popcorn is nearly finished🍿🍿🍿 Fireman he was slow this morning but he has found the 6th gear. Bring a fire extinguisher - that chair is ready to explode. Must now remember all the lies. And now Mr Amnesia Koko entering the picture. Koko sold his soul to get his job back. Bongiwe well said. Also true Bizana. My blood is blue😂😂😂😂 And that decision to bring Amnesia Koko back cost us poor taxpayers billions. Rudolph he was supposed to testify but the tannie has been occupying that chair since this morning. If she once again say ' if I can remember correctly' I am going to drink my bath water. Samuel he is hitting all the right spots. How many careers and people did these hyenas destroy in their quest to get their dirty hands on the public purse😭😭😭😭 Bongiwe he was on the board. Sorry Bongiwe. I see what you mean. John they have been doing it for so long it is almost 2nd nature. Now defending Koko. It was part of their sick plan to bring him back. Why did you not walk the extra mile for the other executives Pinocchio Klein Nope. Was also waiting for his evidence. There goes the memory again. Bongiwe so obvious that they all protected him because he was going to open the vault for them. So sick. Nape😜🍿😅🍿🍿 Charles she should ask Koko what he is using for his amnesia. Lesley they want to establish why she was part of the decision to retain Koko Elias he is cool and calculating. Elton😎😎😎😎 Koketso I think we are all shocked. The tannie was so concerned but still agreed to bring Koko back. Eddie those 3 did not fit into the scheme of things. Very selective memory tannie Klein Now we get to the names to replace the executives. Elias you are so right. Sonwabo they did not want him back. Sonwabo so cold and callous whilst destroying people's lives and careers Another lie. Ngubane gave the names after receiving it from the presidency. Brian jip. Mulugisi just like the evidence from Pamensky. Everytime he was in a corner he brought up the issue of being new on the board. Come clean and admit that you were told to bring in those hyenas. Eddy😁😁😁😁 Mondli I will hang in there. Sleep well guys and girls. Back tomorrow. NOXOLO count yourself lucky that you are not married to her.
