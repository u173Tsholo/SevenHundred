Im going to miss the regulars @Aubrey De Bliquy Which century was this?🤣🤣 @Marius Strydom Ek kan nie wag vir die hof sake nie. Gaan krioel van lekker kry "lol @Aubrey De Bliquy The price of a lockdown packet of smokes could have bought you a house in those days here we go snap @Magda Botha indeed @Valencia J There is a real lack of a decent party to vote for in SA @Blake Yogi totally agreed Just blok Piet. We all have tried to reason with him. I have no time for such negativity @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee Hahaha some of his own medicine
Gina deW,Confused about the starting time - Zondo said last night 10.30 'cos of the late night they had last night
Heather Durr,Trump's brain is still MIA Tllib Sadik is a Gupta stooge or not? The Twitter account says 9.30. "My guess he has fled to Siberia @Blake Yogi no until after 9-Kennedy was so grumpy shouting at the witness that he as a private company was obliged to ensure Denel compiled with the PFMA and that he could get in trouble @Gray Lawrence Hey there Gray Where are they "Hi @Valencia J He is not my friend and he is not learned in the ways of respect What is the issue with Zondo-was he rude this guy sounds like a Sunday morning minister @Teunis van Ree Hi There more politics-sigh This guy is paranoid @Lerato Moleke I am Bi-Polar . I take antidepressants and mood stabilizers. My head is not in the clouds-stigmatization of mental illness must stop @eliasmnisi72 that is highly offensive for those of us who live with mental illness
SanFran Arnold,Adv. Kennedy is coming into his stride. I love how he is firm and without the emotional fan fare. Yesterday he was on fire @Gina deW No chair said 9:30 "@Xolani J Masemula gm @Phakamile Khuzwayo it should be looked into for sure. @Xolani J Masemula hope you are well "@Joshua Borias gm "@Thabang Letsosa the sound is ok Denel was profitable under his leadership "@Smart Guys Former Denel Group Chief Executive Officer and current GCEO Mr Tlib Sadik @Thabang Letsosa always a pleasure "@Simphiwe Kubheka Former Denel Group Chief Executive Officer and current GCEO Mr Tlib Sadik "@Simphiwe Kubheka gm @Sherwin Peters gm @Tom GM @Valencia J do you see me?? I also greeted earlier @Quinton Ndzinisa gm @Nemabubuni Geoffrey gm "@Nemabubuni Geoffrey yes thanks "@Valencia J you are so right. This is no longer about me or us @Piet Vast 🤣🤣🤣 @Sherwin Peters yes he is @Sherwin Peters yes indeed. I just hope Adv. Kennedy is on fire as he was last night. "@Anti DA - it is not as fiery as with the other work streams "@Anti DA - They are all tough "@Anti DA - Pravin is back 30 Nov. JZ Monday. The evidence leaders are mostly SC and some are acting Judges @Anti DA - SC is Senior Counsel and JZ is 16 - 20 Nov. It surely cannot be the Monday that has passed "@Yolo More my lady Y @Anti DA - I am sure that he is "@Anti DA - always a pleasure @Anti DA - I disagree with you completely @Sibusiso Cilo I don't believe that Pravin is a crook. He kept the Gupta's out of the treasury @Anti DA - He does not do that. I don't think you and I are watching the same thing. He has so much law in his head that he runs his comments through everything. @Anti DA - you struggle with the law @Anti DA - again you are lost. DCJ has to be careful about what he says and how he asks questions in order not to jeopardise the commission. You remarks smack of racism "@Anti DA - Being the second highest judge in the land "@Anti DA - It just seems that you are not only as your handle suggests @Yolo More yes queen👏👏👏👏 @Anti DA - as you please. Yes bring on the Burger "Guys even if @Piet Vast is a troll @Naledi Barron Greetings lady N @Anne M. did you see me greet you? @Anne M. yay:virtualhug::virtualhug: @Valencia J indeed "@Valencia J agreed @ALTA nice one @Valencia J I am with you ladyV "@Anti DA - I am going to ask you nicely the first time "@Tay indeed @Valencia J for sure lady V "@Pastor J.J hello there @Roza E hello there @Pastor J.J the race card whichever way its used is horrible and it shows the character of the person using it.

Its horrible what was said today Burger is sooooo skelm @Blake Yogi he is on point. No mess no fuss

My point is this is what happens when an handul of elite are allowed to print money out of thin air. Modern day slaver. Brilliant. Invisible. Effective slavery. Hello @Alta. We have our power going on and off like a yoyo since yesterday. Im on a PC. Poer just came back. Sorry.

Catching up needed🤣 @Heather Mr Kennedy is everything 🤣🤣🤣 @Joshua🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ CAs are all up in this commission. @Austin I am waiting to hear if he will reveal anything valuable or just hide @Austin true 🤣 @SanFran you are correct. They all have different strategies and so far; they have all done a great job @Anti it isnt an enterainment channel. Listen to the info and follow it you will then understand why Senior Counsel is so pricy @Tay 🤣 Then the tough questions follow 🤯🤯🤯 I dont think Chair struggles with English @Anti. His command of the language is excellent "I had to block Anti. Cos of people like that that SABC has another commission stream entitled ""Clean"" cos some are very disrespectful." dirty @Yolo like they are implying this one has become dirty 🤣🤣 Fluent English is not a sign of intelligence. That is only a perception "@Thanda I must say I am with you on this. If it happens Hey @Naledi🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ 😱 Not on my side @Valencia.

I wonder if Mr Burger had all the information... @Tickle McVetkoek they (EFF) got 0 seats yesterday? "@Tickle McVetkoek Thankfully yes @Freddie Van Rhyn because they have no real concrete policies beyond ideoligical kaka. THeres no nitty gritty of getting stuff done and a future.

There is big gap between rich and poor. @Mzalwane Mzale who won the most wards? @Valencia J is there a limited amount space in Capetown? for housing projects @Mzalwane Mzale people believe in the leadership of CR17. @Mzalwane Mzale okay. so the DA is in second place? @Mzalwane Mzale people are tired of the DA @Mzalwane Mzale I think in Lenz @Bandit ZA it's deal they made with Telekom @Mzalwane Mzale so DA is the biggest loses 😂😂😂 @ Valencia J well stated 👏👏👏 @Nemabubuni Geoffrey for sure. 👍 Thabo mbeki was the best African leader GM melds melds @ Sibusiso Cilo Pravin is man of integrity. @Mzalwane Mzale DA is racist party they don't want change. @Mzalwane Mzale 🤣🤣🤣 @Mzalwane Mzale for sure 🤣🤣🤣
Mzalwane Mzala,The elections have come and gone and the numbers speak for themselves. The numbers say the ANC is not dead or dying. The EFF contested all the wards (96) and won 0. Still the EFF was not the biggest looser. @Angelo Doubel That would be the ANC. Gayton Mckenzie's Patriotic Alliance took a ward from the DA in Johannesburg @Angelo Doubel I think the real story is the downward slide of the DA. @Angelo Doubel The DA lost most wards Al Jama-ah took a ward from the DA in Johannesburg @Valencia J I did not mention that because it is not true. I don't tell lies. The Freedom Front Plus took a ward from the DA in JB Marks (North West). I am looking at the IEC figures. You can name the ward or municipality @Valencia J @Freddie Van Rhyn That will not work if the opposition implodes like the DA is doing now. The DA lost 4 wards to smaller parties. FF Plus is dealing with the DA @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee I was saying the EFF contested 96 wards and won 0 but still it was not the biggest looser as that title is reserved for the DA. The Patriotic Front did well as they gained a ward and lost nothing. The IFP did well as they successfully defended all their wards and took the Nkandla one from the ANC. @Zicelo Sokhela They really saw flames @Megan Diedericks Things are bad for the DA @Angelo Doubel Those who leave it for the FF plus say it is not pro-white enough. @Phakamile Khuzwayo For the first time since its formation the EFF contested more wards than the ANC (96) as the ANC chose not to contest one of the Knysna wards. The return was 0 wards for the EFF. "Freedom Front Plus performed well as they lost nothing but took a DA ward in JB Marks @Phakamile Khuzwayo The EFF was never a ward winning party. It gets council seats through PR list. They have previously won 1 or 2 wards in the North West and nothing else. @Anti DA - The DA lost a ward in George (Western Cape) but not in the city. @Anti DA - The DA also lost 3 wards in Johannesburg. "@Anti DA - The DA also lot a ward in Mfuleni lost @Anti DA - They had 123 and they now have 120 wards Sorry @Anti DA - The DA had 103 and now have 100 wards There are no political party schools in South Africa. There are public and private schools. @Anti DA - The numbers in Cape Town remain as they were as all parties retained their wards. The provincial MEC can force a school to accept a pupil @Thanda Sibisi @Anti DA - DA support is declining throughout the country and in the Western Cape IEC is announcing election results live "The ANC retained 64 wards "The DA retained 14 wards @Thanda Sibisi Yes in the wards that were contested yesterday. The EFF won nothing The ANC can not be clubbed with the DA in these elections. Even the Patriotic Alliance performed better than the DA. "The ANC scored 70.8% votes @Nemabubuni Geoffrey The IEC confirmed the strength of the ANC @johannes mailula I agree Mashaba must stop being stubborn to get his party registered. His logo is not far from the one of that party I had never heard of before it complained about Mashaba. @Simphiwe Kubheka The ANC wins Is there an all inclusive party somewhere in the world @FieliesSA? @Simphiwe Kubheka That is what the ANC is doing @Simphiwe Kubheka Looters are getting arrested Such chats do not win elections. @FieliesSA Maybe I should ask for your understanding of 'all inclusive'. Are you talking race? I mean interests. @Simphiwe Kubheka What is 'arrests with no prosecution'?

Magesh Difa,this one looks innocent. I can't answer you. In case I incriminate myself
BanditZA,Because the EFF had nothing to lose? 😂 @ALTA 🙏🏽 "I wonder why SABC is running two streams Are you guys in this chat doing this political thing because people around you stopped listening? Or because you have nothing intelligent to say as regards the commission? Everyone knows EFF is a joke. Problem is DA and ANC are also jokes 😐
Tom,GM Dames and gents of the jury
Freddie Van Rhyn,I know of 3 instances in viljoenskroon in freestate where people were granted RDP houses. which they sold to their neighbour's and moved back into shacks on the field opposite the house Valencia j if you talk about it then you are branded a racist Tommy gun money talks guys the only way to vote ANC out of government is to start winning the municipalities. then they must start repairing the roads and clean up the towns in that way people will see that things are moving for the better Alta that's what I meant by repairing the roads if we cannot convince ANC voters to vote for another party. then let's convince them not to vote ANC. every vote that does not vote for ANC and abstains is a vote for opposition Why does Julius Malema refuse to debate Helen Nortne I agree whole heartedly with you. I love this country

Anti DA -,... This commission is now boring.. Tooth fairies need to be investigated for stealing coloured people's teeth. @SanFran Arnold - I see...who is the toughest lawyer? This Piet guy is a troll? @SanFran Arnold - Is it true that these lawyers are getting paid 36000 per day? Just block the Piet Vast guy. He is just trolling. Pravin* An arrest warrant has been issued against Ace Magushele. "@SanFran Arnold - What do you mean by SC? And when you say Jacob Zuma is appearing on Monday I have blocked that Piet Vast guy long ago because what he is doing constitute as spamming. @SanFran Arnold - Is he still moaning about this commission being biased against him? DA won how many wards? @SanFran Arnold - Thanks for filling me in. I am waiting for Jacob Zuma's and that crook named Pravin Gordon day. Zihle you are also a troll? @SanFran Arnold - The problem is the commissioner doesn't have strong command of the English language😴😴 Were these wards in Cape town or what? @SanFran Arnold - It takes Zondo 30 minutes to construct a single sentence in English 😴😴 @Mzalwane Mzala - Was the voting specifically in relation to wards in Cape Town? So clearly Zondo struggles with English. . @SanFran Arnold - Can you tell the difference between Zondo and the guy that is being cross- questioned in terms of how long it takes between the two to formulate a sentence in English ? @Blake Yogi - All I am saying is they should have employed a better English speaker to head this commission. Zondo is slow in constructing his sentences and this makes me fall asleep 😴 @SanFran Arnold - Have you even listened to those interviews where you have judges butchering the English language because their command of the language is poor? @SanFran Arnold - No I am not anti - Zondo. I just call a spade a spade. It is very clear from the day this commission started that Zondo struggles with English. Lol Zuma is another fool if you are insinuating that I am pro Zuma. @SanFran Arnold - I mean really taking 30 minutes to construct a simple English sentence like how are you is something Zondo suffers from. @Kevin W - Really? You expect a deputy chief justice to speak English like that? @Person of interest - Okay let me just put it this way. Let me not say Zondo command of English is poor since most of his groupies are taking offence of that. Let me rather say he is not articulate. @Nemabubuni Geoffrey - Fine I will just say Zondo can't express himself clearly. @Kevin W - LOL Zondo is articulate? You are making me laugh. So can someone enlighten me on wards that DA lost? Was it in Cape Town? @Megan Diedericks - I see. I was just saying that I would expect a deputy chief justice like Zondo to have better communication skills . @Mzalwane Mzala - How many wards did they have in JHB before the votes? @Nemabubuni Geoffrey - Have y Have you listened to the Chief Justice speaking @ Nemabubuni Geoffrey? @Mzalwane Mzala @ And what about in Cape Town? DA had how many wards? And now are left with how many? I want EFF to become an official opposition party. @Gerald Victor - It is eloquency. @Mzalwane Mzala - Is DA's support declining? Naledi Barron talks too much. @Trevor Arosi - And I wonder why the Chief Justice doesn't speak like that. Lol I am so excited that the DA is losing support. Coloured people in Cape Town will still cling onto it though despite the fact it does absolutely jack for them . DA new policies are created to preserve white privilege. @ALTA - are you taken? @Valencia - I remember saying Cape town coloureds. And if you veg to differ. Tell me one thing that DA has done for cape coloureds? @ALTA - Under EFF you will need to have a black boyfriend.. @Valencia J - Cape coloreds are morons . Everyone knows that. If not then why do they continue to vote for the DA? @Peet Venter - It looks like the DA may merge with VF plus😆😆😆 since they are having a tug of war on white afrikaaners voters.. Lol Zihle.. @Peet Venter - Do you think DA will succumb to to VF plus terms and conditions? @SanFran Arnold - Race will always be a factor every where we go and ignoring it is simply being ignorant. Are you trying to tell me that DA doesn't cater for a certain race? @Peet Venter - To be honest with you as a black South African I would rather vote for VF plus than the DA because the former doesn't hide it true colours and I like that. DA is a faux party. I asked Valencia J to tell me one thing that DA has ever done for Cape Coloureds and she couldn't answer it. Meanwhile she is a proud supporter of a party that marginalises and manipulate coloured ppl How many Coloureds left the DA citing racism within the party? And these cape Coloureds still continue to belive that a party which is established to protect white privilege cares about them. EFF is the only party that can liberate us. Lol. . Maybe Mashaba party then. . Ghandi was a racist.. EFF will grow? @Tervor Arosi - There I agree with you. "If EFF was pro poor and communists DA hides its racism and EFF doesn't hide its racism. That is the fundamental difference. And I can only deal with someone who shows me their true colours than someone who hides that. Gerrie Nel should do the omotoso trial not this. @Nemabubuni Geoffrey - What time? I hate DA with passion.

Megan Diedericks,"The problem we have with voting is who do we vote for The DA have lost the plot why not sabc 😂😂 @Anti DA - Have you forgotten that South Africa is part of Africa and having a proper command of the english language is not a prerequisite for being African @Anti DA - please go away The fact of the matter is that all parties in some form of leadership position in this country has failed its citizens an we as citizens need to hold them accountable for that failure. @Trevor Arosi - agreed absolutely What a surprise... Anc wins @mpumelelo mangali - very true @mpumelelo mangali - I watch that speech that Joe Biden gave at the senate it was very moving So Ace is just thief he has not quite reached racist status yet.

That is all that is needed. @Piet Vast = Troll Did not get the name of the fellow testifying now. @Sibusiso Cilo. If Ace is prosecuted at all. (Anything can still happen from dockets disappearing to witnesses deiappearing or getting intimidated). No way he will not be successfully prosecuted @Phakamile Khuzwayo and they send their children to DA schools.

Welcome @Pastor J.J @SanFran Arnold a certain Myeni comes to mind 🤣 People playing the race card usually use it as an extreme to force their opinion/narrative. Dont start a conversation if your not prepared to listen or attempt to understand someone else's opinion Bye @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee "@mpumelelo mangali I dont agree. To treat/call other people racists without facts "The ANC has overplayed their hand. They have ignored their own constitution in order to ""maintain party stability"". The top 6 decisions is more powerful than their laws..." IM struggling to read this witness... @Gerard Victor The ANC top 6 decided that the stability of the party is more important than the ANC's constitution... @mpumelelo mangali I want to extend your statement. We must stay away from race biased leaders. Example The ANC.DA and EFF do not qualify. Im looking to ASA to fill that need... "@Nemabubuni Geoffrey What do you mean? Is it day dreaming to hope for a better @Mzalwane Mzala. Its its ignorant to assume there isnt. The fact that a lady is vice president of USA is a big step.

The Western Cape may soon become independent. @Anti DA It will happen under VF Plus terms though.
