nathi mathe,But he is talking about wrong things that happened before his arrival 🤣🤣🤣 He doesn’t want to go down alone😂😂😂
Sbonelo Mhlongo,Mzwanele was well briefed by his legal team. I can tell. Dismantle this Rolls Royce?? why do i hear police sirens?? in the flesh @Jabulile Mazwane pleasure. Manyi was well briefed TNA Phumla Williams is corrupt Ms Williams is at the center of Manyi's submissions.
Soso Fuuu,Sam stop smoking nyaope we know that stupid song about S.A becoming Zimbabwe YES EFF IS READY TO GOVERN Whites must forget they will never rule this country Pule can you prove that EFF looted VBS? then stop making stupid allegations wait for the commission there is no mention of EFF in that VBS report brain shivambu is EFF now? he is the organisation? these people are busy saying EFF looted VBS but they have nothing to prove that mxxm Pule and Jan you are talking from experience nyaope boys we will never get the land ANC is/was never radical they are scared of white people people will sell back the land to these people because they want money and food so the land must be administered by government "People took money instead of the land before because they were hungry @Mnisi you are misinformed chief read EFF constitution instead of hearsay what you are saying is incorrect 😂😂😂 uyabanyisa umanyi 😎😎😎 heee umanyiii tshini Thixoooo😂😂😂😂 Mr Maleka will stick to the rules Manyi

Showdown,When does the real fireworks start???? Corruption does not exist I am ready to corrupt also................. "Nothing wrong with greed You all are too suspicious!!!! THERE IS NO CORRUPTION YOU ARE ALL JEAULOUS FOR YOU ARE NOT CLEVER ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT GREED IS don't you all see how rediculous the system is???? Everybody fools another!!!! "Thato
peter pott,"adv maleka attempted to water down this evidence by claiming that he doesn't have the documents.😀😀Manyi is a lawyer imagine the day duduzane come here look at adv maleka. They must wait. They are costing us a lot of money
Thato M,Critical issues relating to procurement and supply chain operational procedures and approvals He's got paper trail as proof from National Treasury submitted to the Commissions legal team Manyi is on point. Supply chain management at GCIS was being looted National Treasury report was made available on procurement irregularity at GCIS I wonder were Themba Maseko was at this time of R64million? "Manyi will leave the media favourites wanting. He's got evidence Which system? Oh ok @Showdown Thought this was a meaningful engagement not platform for sarcasm. Cool What was Phumla Williams doing? Unbelievable @Thabiso Pooe @Sthakathi Khumalo @Monique Jones ANN7 licence was renewed by Mutlichoice which is headed by Mwelo who Mantashe son in law. a faction against Zuma's within the ANC *not renewed @Monique Jones I meant the channel's licence was not renewed. Therefore no longer on air. Perhaps snippets still available on You Tube "Manyi - truth to power @Monique Jones no. Not anymore. But he is mentioning reports and exhibits from National Treasury investigation. @Sthakathi Khumalo what other proff suffices in legal terms? @makhosi nobhatyi evidence led in legal process isn't about shortness / length but substantive facts. "@Sthakathi Khumalo nothing @makhosi nobhatyi argue better. When Ms Williams was accusing Manyi of wrong doing did you apply the smae principle? @Sthakathi Khumalo Deputy Chief Justice is on record as saying the evidence before isn't convincing and called for more people to come forward. That is already telling "@Sthakathi Khumalo ofcourse "DO you guys know who the biggest suppliers of GCIS are That'll give you an understanding of why Williams is painted in positive light and Manyi bad without hearing their sides in full Manyi is on Adv Maleka's case 😀 @Zizoh absolutely Manyi will take Adv Maleka & team to the cleaners. He is solid This was a substantial input. Factual and evidenced based
kenneth mampa,Grounevald is number one racist from FF+ "Der nthng wrng with Juju's cuzin receiving mny

jacky mnisi,"The EFF's policy is that Land should belong to the state and The ANC stance says it should be returned to the people. EFF want state capitalism  "If you have read Animal Farm with clear understanding @soso how am I misinformed? they pronounced it the way I said it. this was an exchange also in Parly between Julius and the President. the president even went on to defend our people and said they are capable of ownership. The Eff and its followers love to act like they are beyond reproach. they don't want to be called out for their blunders! Manyi seem to have his story altogether but all this will catch up with him.
