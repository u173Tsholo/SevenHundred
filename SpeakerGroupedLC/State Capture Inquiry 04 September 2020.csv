Serepa Le Mabona,"Just joining "@Carmen James "@Sirshin "@Mthokozisi Ndlovu
Carmen James,Adjourned for 45 minutes Correct Serepa La Mabona Judge giving counsel for Vincent Smith time to study Afrizzi's supplementary affidavit which apparently only arrived last night. Kev Smith ......I don't know where to start. LoL "The problem is none of these crooks ever thought that the day would come where they have to account for their actions. They normalized lying Vincent Smith Phuti S 11am Mike Clark there are ministers who have repudiated Ace's assertion....Hanekom and Manuel among them.Why should we believe Ace Magashule? 11 am Oratuwe There has been an adjournment to consider Agrizzi's supplementary affidavit that arrived last night Pleasure Derek Govender jasper dougal Who should control Agrizzi's affidavits? Thabo Maneli Mama Action is done for now Today is the turn of Vincent Smith He will answer to the question of his BOSSASSA 'LOAN' Mike Clark I am not defending all ANC MP's.....I am just wary of using Ace Magashule as a credible source Samuel S we are adjourned until 11am Sadly they lie after taking the oath S. Skosana they use particular evidence leaders for testimony of the same type...All this evidence is about BOSSASSA Very unfair for Judge to rattle Notshe like this.... What rubbish are you talking now Vincent Smith???? Vincent Smith trying to excuse his taking of bribes....Never!!!!!!! a b c Taking bribes from BOSSASSA TV Gee that is an important question. Amazing how so many people mentioned at this Commission are now dead!!! I love Advocate Notshe Notshe on fire!!!!!!!!! Go Notshe..... Notshe has no time for nonsense Notshe is a bulldog!!! Noshe doesn't have time for nonsense.He wants to see black and white notshe has time for jokes Tefo Victor Kolatsoeu Notshe on fire today jabulani majozi I agree with you. We sometimes confuse competency with charisma "I actually dont think that that was Notshe's point at all Kanti Smith was friendly with Watson and Agrizzi???? This sounds like Mokonyane's car story yesterday Why did school fees have to be paid immediately? Never thought he would have to defend this These people earn more per month than many people earn per year......And they cannot pay their children's school fees......RUBBISH!!!!!! Why are @ANC children studying in the UK??? BECAUSE @ANC have messed up our South African universities I am a rural boy!!!!!!!!! Eish!!!!!! I wonder how his daughter feels about this!!!!EMBARESSING his child. Expose the lies rural boy!!!!!! Bank of Agrizzi doesnt provide documents Lady T Advocate Notshe providing documents from Smith's daughter's university "Lady T Forget it Smith......You are toast!!!!! Exactly K. Morule....My point exactly. Why was he borrowing from Agrizzi if the big boss was his friend? @Derek Govender he keeps referring to the fact that this transaction is recorded in his Company's books....Trying to push the narrative that all is kosher. "But why does Mr Smith have to keep on borrowing money @Prns Chrmng Agrizzi is not in this chat room Hehehe @Prns Chrmng All these madalas at this State Capture Enquiry are a big embarassment.... Always having CASH FLOW PROBLEMS..... I dont trust politicians that are not financially responsible ''@mixdd 1 They feel entitled Judge Zondo He really loves his lunch @Malonsta Knight
HBWorx,Whats goins on here at the zondo zoo gossip and tea party lol "When are we goins to talk real state capture like on a geopolitical level Just gossip and tea party here
jasper dougal,Why are these things not addressed in chambers before witness testimony starts ? Frustrating to say the least "Why are we waiting  "May be a long story  "Goes like ‘Chair  At this rate it will be time to finish before they even got started! What about the classic ‘ I don’t know what I don’t know ! "I think they should do replays of witnesses caught out in obvious lies  Some Lying thief called Vincent Smith When will Mr Magashule be invited for a sit down ? "Any guesses as to which comes first  "How about we go and make a nice cup of tea  Tomorrow "Unacceptable that even now there is no forward planning  "All these thieves will never see the inside of a prison cell  Just Window zDressing Make them under a polygraph test "I reckon that they are all sipping a cocktail  I must be the only UK person to be watching nothing at all ! Yes "How about every time they stop like this  And ZA toon ! "They lie when taking the oath  "This is like drawing teeth  "Mr Smith never expected to have been caught out  Why has Zums never been invited back to finish what he started? What is the ANC without Commrades ?
Donald Ngoako Maponya,"Hey banna
Kwakhe Mthethwa,but im truly disappointed with my anc leaders they may defend themselves but they can not defend themselves against ballot box in the next election will meet them there i can promise them.

Phuti Sekwadi,"vincent Smith "what time are they starting thanks
Mike Newlands,Does that sound about right but I guess where the ANC MP's are concerned does it matter? They are all corrupt. As ACE says show me a minister that has not benifited from state contracts @Carmen James well I guess someones lieing but thats the trouble with ANC who do you believe!. Zuma called Hanakom an enemy agent! Was he lieing.Manual is guilty he watched billions stolen did nothing @Carmen James There are 4 anc mps in parliemnt caught telling lies after taking the oath.Joemant_Peterson aplogised for lieing & is chair Police committee you cant make this up @jasper dougal Ace and the lads are sitting around the boardroom table chowing steak and egg sarmies right know no doubt laughing the stupidy of the South African voter @Eion Gaum Again apartheid . Its the old story I am a thief but apardheid made me do it. "@Sirshin Moodliar as they always do Thief of Thieves you mean😄 He ran the committee to defend Zuma Nkandla scam sham committee. @Thethelela Mbuqe if his lips are moving he's lieing @Thethelela Mbuqe If his lips are moving he's lieing "So Is our beloved Vincent defender of the poor Smith suspended? If not why not Its scandalous but unsurprising. This hypocrite has no shame. @Ndosi nods I held the entire ANC in high regard before they became the gangster they are today. Sadly there is not one I respect!🤧🤮 "@Ndosi nods comrade I am sure he was very very uncomfortable sitting in a 5 star hotel sipping exotic drinks. NO NO LIAR THEY SHOULD MEET YOU AT YOUR OFFICES THIS IS STATE BUSINESS U DO NOT MEET AT RESTURANTS OR HOTELS. Its sad the ANC cannot understand they are the guardians of our money casual meetings in hotels without diaries and officials is NOT the way you conduct yourself. "@Ndosi nods This man can gain our respect very quickly he can say he failed and tender his resignation right now! Sadly "We need to remember
Jacqui Baumgardt,Ace is a master manipulator - he;'s probably the most dangerous man in SA right now @Thabo Maneli that was yesterday @Thabo Maneli - she even threw her husband under the bus @Canis a 5D "Exactly @Lady T - lol!
Derek Govender,@Carmen thank you just switched it on now was wondering what was going on "From an accounting perspective it's incorrect to record a personal study loan transaction as a ""LOAN"" in the company business books!!!!" @carmen but it's an accounting flaw Smith is lying through his teeth @mixdd1 exactly my point @abc surely he will hv lots of time in prison to do that @shabangu theres no more money to buy ppe hehehe So far only Agrizzi is out on 20k bail yet he blew the whistle @Muller Pretoria was a beautiful city its no different to jhb cbd now Not cheese sandwich ..... chicken licken @Garth i hear you loud and clear bro The problem began during the take over in my opinion.It should have been an evolution not a revolution.then these guys could have learnt how to run a country seeing that they were fighting in the bush @Lindani exactly my point @ABC a party that can run a country as though you running a corporate company In fact it could be more we don't know what else has been borrowed behind closed doors

Samuel Skosana,Has the commission started yet? Many thanks Is this the only evidence leader they have? Comrades are still stealing as late as today Oversight means : Find ways to steal Red flags mean orange overalls Once a thief always a thief We Africans are God's step children I seem to recall that he was a teacher Mr Notshe is slowly gaining my confidence and respect "He was scared of Zuma Did you repay the loan?? Watch this space. He is stuttering now Adv Notshe is a master of exposing corruption "Did you repay the ""LOAN""" What a smart way to conceal CORRUPTION Spot on Mulisa The respect I had for this chap is now gone forever "True

fuzile dazana,is he cracking the bus is coming he going under the bus why not going to the bank kickbacks
Tommygun,Conflict of interests or possible one. Was he ever _really_ expected to pay back the loan? @a b c at least Uni fees are easy to check "Oh Aberwystwyth People in government need to do an introductory Ethics 101 calls before getting a job. Course And what happened with the other 300k after school fees were paid? "its a very long time to pay a loan over as well His audited loan amount happens to be a convienient exit door/get out of jail card. "I waonder if the full amoutnt was mentioned in his audited financials what was Agrizzis memory of the loan? odd with all these assurances of collatoral/ shares and abilities to pay back in 8 yrs that there were no agreements whatso ever. Maybe this is one of the few who thought of plausable deniability when getting the cash...

mixdd1,Nothing untoward about getting a loan from someone working for a corrupt company. It's like these ANC people think we're idiots. No interest on a loan of R600 000 over 8 years. Must be nice. "If he was taking a personal loan that he would pay back Is there anyone in the ANC that isn't corrupt? The most shocking thing is that these corrupt politicians see nothing wrong with their actions.
