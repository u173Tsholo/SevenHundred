San Terence Manyike,ANC is the future.‚úä‚úä
Tlhogi Dube,Sitting in a double bed ? @Thando Nkuta have you ever spent 7 years by your self in a small confined space. Stop dismissing people pain chief just listen "@peter pott 2011 was the last time SAA made an operating profit "@peter post go check your facts Coleman was part of SAA in 2001 @peter pott do you understand the concept of going concern? @peter pott Im not her spokesperson you choosing to quote lies for no reason Andrew coleman chief!!! Dudu Myeni tried to throw around that lie @Thando Nkuta chief google the financial statements dude @peter post its not sad the business model of airlines now requires them to lease aircraft. That way they able to use the best aircraft every 2-3 years without sinking millions. @peter post you can challenge the cost of the leases and whether they are favourable to SAA. But the concept of leasing is standard in the industry. @peter pott Boeing releases new aircraft every 5 years imagine having to spend R10billion every 5 years to buy aircraft it makes no business sense when you can reduce the risk. Lease = right of use chief owning something out right doesn't always make perfect business sense "@peter pott SAA collapsed because of bad management (especially cost)  @Mpho Kgomo she is giving background and details on her role.
Mark Carrier,ANC is so corrupt but EFF is communist !
peter pott,Mr katz is president CR personal advocate. hmmm! "masilela! he was the deputy president in this ""rotten cabinet"". meaning he must excuse himself too following your reasoning" Barbara now speaks like she at the bar. Here is just one question: was the lives of black people improved during the turn of Barbara Hogan as a public enterprise minister? yes/no Mr Q. which year? back then cannot be the answer "Dude. that was not profit. We sold our fleet "Dube. Here she is out of her own mouth Dube. don't attempt to be her spokesperson. this are comrades fighting their own personal battles in the public gallery. How Zuma treated kathrada is on the table here sadly is that we don't own majority of the planes we see at our airports. We are leasing them. for how much ? dube. You got to be kidding me. model of airlines?really Michael katz name comes so often in this discussion.lol "Dube. Now long ago SAA was in parliament. They confirm that they are paying R283m pm The is where out problem is. someone accept a role as a minister. And she goes to outsiders to help her understand her job. well done Judge Zondo adriaan lakay is looking for a job
hassiem fisher,its not easy to remove someone from his position unless due process have been followed.

He and Ramaphosa are BEE billionnaires. I wonder if white people used to complain about the apartheid government as much as they do about the present day government. Can they just call Zuma to this commission so he must end this once and for all. The jokers are wasting our time.

Michael Myers,that's right hound. it's a shame @hound How is it possible for these people to run a black country and its resources. did anyone also watch the job summit. South africa has no serious technical jobs directed to the black people @hound @marc South Africa president said they'll start manufacturing trains with the new company gibela. 61% is owned by France and 30% by South Africa ..... How are South Africans moving forward. this is a lie. And most of the investors I saw were German Indians Chinese..... yeah. I was researching everything I could and most of the job training is done outside of Africa . they are no manufacturing of phones or anything most is from China and Europe that means we are dependant on these countries and continent for our clothing food and shelter. South Africa is labelled the best of Africa.....i disagree. South Africa is economically dominated "the problem is the black government the ANC has deprived the people of money to develop in education supposed to cater to the majority. that being said blacks are the majority
Takalani Luthada,people who were elected by 2007 in polokwane are all who led the countto these mess and Malema now he makes a lot of noise about them whereas he campaigned for them and bet with his life
