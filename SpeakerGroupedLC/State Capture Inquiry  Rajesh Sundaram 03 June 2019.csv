makhosi nobhatyi,This is going to expose Zuma We are starting to the Guptas whistle blowers now this month everything will be out I agree @Magda Seguin Zuma and Guptas were looking quick money to enrich themselves with tax payers money "@Zikhona Zondani money is in Dubai "They are fighting those who are against corruption like Gordhan Nothing "@Zikhona Zondani exactly that is my problem I think we should support those who stand to defend the country from corruption "No one should steal from us I love wat is been revealed here I am waiting those guys who run away for 2 years to hide after they expose them "@ Keith S. Dinabantu 😃😃😃 we must protect the sitting president @Magda Seguin I think Zuma courts everyone in surprise coz they didn’t expect this to happen but were given him to much space to do whatever he wants so were too scared "@Keith S.Dinabantu he read everything old man knows that going there is like supporting Ramaphosa "They are attacking Gordhan because the man is a machinery to fight corruption and state corruption Manyi buy new Age "@Andries kgwax Gordhan he spoke out when there was allegations level by NPA This state capture mustn’t divide us instead unite us to fight any action of corruption and state capture no more that we allow to happen "I was shocked and seeing as embarrassing report PP findings @Andries kgwax watch the space "We voted ANC not to defend but expose corruption and those whom done wrong bring money back and sentenced because they belonged in prison "@Derek main I said to you b4 elections we are not voting for individual Here we are talking about the cancer which is eating our country which is corruption whoever does that we should rebuke them and must go to jail "All Money was channeled to Guptas companies  Share holder Zuma
Rushay Booysen,Gigaba All Zuma's Pawns at play @Gerry Roman Duduzane and Jacob they learned to work in tandem like other African leaders where their kids was doing the work in the background The father of Radical Economical Thievery sold this country out. The hangman in the olden days would be waiting at the gallows for the traitor. @0Sweetgal0 no this is not days of our lives "The Guptas Human trafficking Duduzane
Thando Moroka,"Gigabyte
nhlanhla nkosi,gigabite🍆 home affairs DG @ thando
clive oconnell,I can’t even get Home Affairs to answer a phone in one day Couldn’t put ' in visa correctly. Couldn’t leave SA 5 months to rectify after solicitors letter (bribe) If your a cadre employee it’s your job to follow ANC laws 1st.
Robert Russell,@clive oconnell..... true story....LOL!!!!! There is constant debate about who invented Live Streaming.... none about who broke it.... @Thando Nkutha ....that was the EFF who stole Grannies money
Gerry Roman,The common denominator is Zuma We live in Doha. We applied for an unabridged birth certificate at the SA embassy here for my daughter 6 months ago. Still waiting!
Mulunghisi Mulunghisi,is this guys will give us full details if this ANC are not fixing themselves now they are gorverning this country for the last time now
hilton modike,sound please eish that's sad actually how much did the guptas steal from us @nash dube pple must remember that opposition party's aim is 2 unseat any seating government.zuma was the worst by my opinion.eg he persuade RET policy when he was cornered 9 month B4 his term where is the Gupta family why don't they come back Anc isn't a problem our leadership are the one stealing from us not the Anc.so because the own the all the arms of law nothing could be done @nelson musoliwa they realised that since he is a deliquent they will steal as much as he can and give duduzane crumps he won't tell the difference
Bongani Dennis Jamela,Gigaba and Zuma are in deep waters
Amanda Watson,"All the people brought from outside SA were supposed to transfer their skills to locals
Magda Seguin,I see there is decorum on this forum since I stopped commenting.I couldn't take the harassment and racism from the trolls A lot of people at Home Affairs must have recieved bribes to expedite these work visas "I saw an interview on ENCA with this gentleman Sounds like human trafficking and slave living conditions "@Albert Noah yes Zuma is pleading poverty saying he must sell socks and hats but he must have nested the money away offshore True @Zikhona Zondani "This man is very brave Apparently a third of the GDP amounting to 2 trillion was stolen @hilton modike the entire NPA Hawks and IPID was captured...Jiba and Mwe Mwerebi was Zumas deployed to see that nothing and nobody gets investigated "Zuma was mentioned throughout this commission 🤣Zumanomics Mbeki is an economics graduate from Sussex University All the politicians who pushed for Mbeki to be ousted and went to Polokwane to have Zuma instated as president are all complicit in his theft including supporting him for 9 years And Malema was the most vocal in support of Zuma "EFF is in serious financial trouble And another R109k for Afriforum News reports said over the weekend they have until Friday this week to pay Afriforum else they will seize assetts "Fact is And then the PP closes the Estina case and says she found nothing wrong Manuel said he will donate the R500k to the VBS victims He said he wants no agents or middlemen involved in the distributing the money "The EFF hate Gordhan "There are many being praised "Anyway "Yes Are you even listening to your own reasoning @Andries Kgwax? So in your opinion the rest of the population has no say if they didn't vote ANC? "The country is bankrupt "Dream on The citizenry are who exactly? Hearsay like when investigative journalists told the country for ten years about state capture and everyone said ...give proof.Well the proof is here isn't it? I never worked for the state and played my tax thank you.Dont project Zuma theft on innocent citizens @Topsy Kretts speak for yourself "Millions are hungry and have no jobs "Everyone wanted Cele "ANC WAS and STILL is the ruling party "ANC is the name of a party "Making excuses for Zuma is playing the victim game Read the Constitution then you will understand democracy at it's best.We all are intelligent educated people in this forum..I HOPE "Did anyone spot Manyi in the room today What a toxic workplace AAN7 was...terrible In any case that TV station was a disaster "Never forget that ALL Zumas wives had the same perks @tabze did Madiba bankrupt the country? The CAPTURE SURNAME IS ZUMA That is the same app used by the Saudis on their women in the country @tabze do yourself a favour and read the 2001 World Bank definition of state capture.It is long but very explicit.Your Freudian slip is showing. I remember when he left SA in a hurry..he ran for his life @Topsy Kretts where is YOUR petition? As long as people do not violate YT community rules we can debate as much as we want to..
0Sweetgal0,Cant they get on with the case?

Albert Noah,@Thando Nkutha DG hOME aFFAIRS @Naledzani Mashau. Actually this guy published a damning book on his stay at ANN7. @babette fagan Already out Maybe Google for it Book name: Indentured - Behind The Scenes At Gupta TV
Naledzani Mashau,It seems like the cat will be out of the bag today. This witness is ready to spill the beans "I'm with you my brother The president? Amen! Or he wanted to say the former president? "The ""Big Elephant in the room "" is about to get out of the bag? oops" "The ""Elephant in the room ""has been exposed  I said it categorically that this must be the last 5 years of the once glorious movement and still say it Not really fools because they didn't know what has been happening behind closed doors "You can sugar-coated it the way you want
Kapn Krunch,there's no one man it points to a vile corrupt party that's still in power 60% of our nation voted for the ones who allowed this to happen they sat quiet while an idiot who hasn't passed grade 3 looted this country they were quiet because they also got payed the same people who voted him as president shortly after he went on trial for rape
Zee Zondani,and to think that some of us voted for Mzwanele Manyi into parliament 🤔 "What did Zuma do with all the money he looted the sound is fine we were most certainty not going to vote for the EFF """me"" and the 10 millions votes out there" "@makhosi nobhatyi  "@Mulunghisi Mulunghisi  @makhosi nobhatyi 😂😂 "Zuma last week said he is clean Who trusts what Malema says? the man praised zuma for years and claimed his blood is blue and green and how he will never form a political party against the anc 😂😂 who can trust that? "how ironic that while zuma is on the hot seat "I wonder what the party with social media votes is going to do this week where is facebook and twitter inaugurating malema? "only people from the daycare have the guys to call others ""fool"" 😂😂 ." @Mzalwane Mzala indeed imagine someone calling you a fool for voting who you want in power? unbelievable!! and this thing of these daycare goers calling people fools and idiots for not voting for them is deeply rooted in the eff. the fools voted. live with it! who must we vote for ?😂😂😂 😂😂 not vote for them because they are crooks. that is just a weak argument. "@Thami Ngwenya sadly that is all Derick ever does here 😂😂😂 Zuma- the mafia boss "derik must be eff because his statements are exactly that of Malema ""we must punish the anc by no voting for them"" shame 😂😂 zoyvotela u waya waya le anc 😂😂😂" "derek wow he must really feel something huge in his chest and ego "I am not condoning zum "u confuse us

Helped her to launch a party in Nasrec @Granny Mokwena Not so exciting to me cause Rajesh wrote a book already on this. Its like am watching news repeat @Neo Thebe Very organised gang lol @Albert Noah Remember that Indentured last year lol. Zuma was a part of the news content editorial @Magda Seguin All were captured. See how NPA pursued Pravin. They did so cause Pravin was very strict and against wasteful expenditure @vincent kolobe Trump learned from Zuma cause he says he's clean but the report says he's not! Zuma has got himself to blame... he's so or such a domkop @Simon Davies @makhosi nobhatyi Zuma economics were about involving business chaps to loot. Mbekis was to involve business leaders to employ citizens and help grow the economy. @Caron Hill Wow. Thought you've decided to be offline totally. Glad to chat with again... Are you goog? "@Magda Seguin Yeah anyway I always maintained @Magda Seguin .. Spot on! @makhosi nobhatyi Hence he never pitched up on his inauguration right? lol. Malema is funding FF-PLUS and AfriForum EFF assets were seized right? @Simon Davies Big reckless mouth indeed! Was expecting more of trouble than the existing for Malema. @Zikhona Zondani I think AfriForum is going to seize EFF assets this week. Watch the space. @makhosi nobhatyi They hate Pravin for exactly that. I can't understand why media can't show both sides of the story on this..... especially press. @Andries Kgwax Not Gordon maarn @Andries Kgwax Pravin was a hindrance to Zupta corruption...why he was removed and why van Rooyen was installed? @Andries Kgwax Its the reality. He was my boss for 7 years at SARS. Some people didn't like him cause he was strict on expenditure... He did the same with the corrupt Zuma crew and got fired overnite @Andries Kgwax Don't be a denialist of the reality pls... Pravin hindered or prevented all the corrupt Zupta deals. He even gave Malema's funders a lot of problem on cigarette smuggling. @Zikhona Zondani 😂😂😂😂😂

Wildthing,Tax money thrown down the drain another way of saying it is Brown nosing . because he is the biggest puppet +FF is a good choice so Zuma places nut job in charge of SABC while he spends his time working and pushing ANN7 with tax money. ha ha

Yvonne Morudu,zuma must go to jail
Piet Madimetja,former president you said there is no way the can find Zuma. they will look everywhere they won't find Zuma. What is happening today.

Mzalwane Mzala,Hola Advocate Thandi Norman! Proud of you. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU The EFF has until Friday Insults will not stop us from exercising our right to choose who will lead us. So the former president behaved like a shareholder in the Gupta media empire? Ten Million voters ignored insults and voted for the ANC UDerek uya painelwa @Pelisa Vanda Do you choose to be my spokesperson? @sipho cebo 👊👊 @kenneth mampa There was never an official ANC statement about 9 wasted years. Democracy includes the right to choose a government of your choice through periodic voting. @kenneth mampa Give me the link Did someone who voted for Mngxitama use his/her mind wisely? Who used their minds wisely? @Thando Nkutha How do you explain Mayor Bobani and the Hawks' interest in him? To enable the choice of voters there must be a variety of parties in a democracy Freedom of association is part of democracy @kenneth mampa That was Tito Mboweni's formulation. @kenneth mampa Would you agree that a party's election manifesto represents an official position of that party? Freedom of choice is part of democracy

Dan Bourne Yeshurun,😂 I specifically waited for this day at the commission
Pheladi Lamola,Mara Zuma was and is an imbecile. The Guptas were actually laughing at the country (with Zuma) after the Waterkloof drama. Some unknown guy took the fall but Zuma knew!!!
ofhie Muofhe,malema's inauguration on youtube will be held on friday @ 12h00 jail them all and leave zuma alone ANC all the way dont worry its my money i dont trust this indian guy
Ben Cole,There are politicians and officials who give credence to this saying/proverb: “Empty vessels make the most sound.” Will eventually catch up with them. Let’s remind ourselves what Tito Mboweni said during his budget speech: There is no more spare money around. We cannot bail out failing SOEs.THERE IS NO MORE MONEY. Our debt to GDP ratio is too high. We all voted according to our consciences. Too late to still continue to canvass for votes. Now criticise the parties’ policies and what their leaders do and say. Check the dictionary for a definition of democracy. Can we tone down the insults?? "Derek Main "Derek Main and Sipho Cebu
Derek Main,Yep - only the ANC fools couldn't see that Zuma is a crook. Their votes caused all these problems for SA. And they are still being fooled by empty promises. @Andries Kgwax Don't make your problems ours. You still vote for ANC after all this proof of corruption. That's a big problem in my book. @Thami Ngwenya Some things just have to be said. "@Kekeletso Timati Aaah - that old chestnut. When it suits the ANC @Topsy Kretts Only if you voted for the crooks. "@Zikhona Zondani If you can sit here and listen to all this evidence of corruption caused by the ANC and still vote for them @sipho cebo Anyone but the ANC. @Thami Ngwenya Aaah - the race card. I take it you can't argue on the merits. @Zikhona Zondani Anyone but the ANC - they are crooks. @sipho cebo That would definitely be smarter than voting for the ANC. @Thami Ngwenya I'm saying it like I see it. @Zikhona Zondani Have you not been listening to all this testimony? @Kekeletso Timati Sure - why not. UDM "If you voted ANC "@Zikhona Zondani ""Fools"" is putting it politely." @Cerebis Of course people can vote for the ANC. I just think it's idiotic given that the ANC is corrupt to the core and stealing our money. @makhosi nobhatyi As the ANC has done for the last 25 years? No thanks. @Jay Jay I did. There's your answer. @sipho cebo You must be an ANC member. I'll have to draw you a picture. "@sipho cebo You see - you are part of the problem. So what you're saying is that no matter how bad or corrupt the ANC is or becomes @sipho cebo And what I'm asking you is do you think at all before casting your vote? @sipho cebo Exactly @sipho cebo to illustrate that you do not vote wisely. All those who didn't vote for crooks. Yes - more of the same. @Zikhona Zondani Not too bad - and you? Or am I hurting your feelings? @Ben Cole You can block me if you like. @Zikhona Zondani That's a typical ANC fool's excuse. Zuma = ANC "Because Zuma is the norm for the ANC
Sean Douglas,Derek individuals are corrupt ointhe party not the party its selft plz man lets separet this thinngs. Derek can i vote for the party you voted for? anyway what is your party?

Pelisa Vanda,@Mzalwane Mzala so you prefer corruption over insults. To me none is virtuous
Moshoeu Mabusela,"@Derek Main - a fool is a man who decided to discriminate and disadvantage the majority you blaming now. Apartheid is a crime against humanity
Nelson Musoliwa,The Guptas brothers were making lot of fooish acts/games with Zuma because they know he was intellectually flawed So Manyi was drive to NN7 by Zuma end of the story I wonder if Zuma still contend that there was no state capture in SA. Manyi reacted to my tweet about black professionals who are out of jobs; the likes of molefe or moyane angrily today so i now know why tabze are you saying madiba enriched himself in the expense of the nation? tabze i disagree unless if state capture mean different things to me and you. Anyway Zuma was intellectually disable; was not supposed to a president anyway
Millicent Shozi,Can anyone define democracy for me? I want a rich man can anyone connect me to the guptas MAFIA
