Anthony Osauyi J.,let EFF take over
Maat Community,Africa fo Africans... The wealth and power of whites is built on the enslavement and colonizations of other people..This is the end of that "white will not donate to Blacks The Africans carrying out coruptions are following the cultural values of Europeans Africans values is based on Ubuntu "Ubuntu=Maat This whole state capture happened because Africans are out of their minds....Not using African systems of Governance and culture as the foundation for development.. "Those who want dignity must pay for it in the proper currency "Minister Gigaba was and is first captures in his MIND..disreguarding African cultural and spiritual values..Ubuntu There is no such thing as a free market...Just the opportunity for exploiters to extract wealth and the expense of others NEOLIBERALISM..the current phase of capitalism wants to force all enterprise into privatisation... It is not capitalism or Communism...The right is Ubuntu. "Ubuntu=Maat is structured into the fundamental laws of nature There is a cultural unity of all Africans..based on Ubuntu/Maat/The Tree of Life/Paut Neteru etc It is not just about the individual..Zuma Or the other individuals like Gigaba African Governance systems is based on those in governement and leadership basing their personal developement and institutions on MAAT/UBUNTU. African are currently following the Europeans system and values...This is where we are all going wrong. THere is an African system of governance that all government in African and the Black world is ignoring Africans leaders are mostly out of their African MINDS "They have been educated in and with Eurpean cultural values and systems In the African approach to Government..you dont rise to leadership without been trained in UBUNTU/MAAT and progress ur personal development based on this value system The original capture is kidnapping Africans to built the European and white world wealth "This wealth in Europe started and is maintained through the capture of Black wealth THe capture of the African MIND is needed to maintain white wealth. Why do you thin Europe and Amerian is promoting all sort of so called leadership programs in Africa? Slavery and colonialism is about capturing the MINDS of africans...using Europeanised African religions etc THe foundation of African integrity is UBUNTU/MAAT.. A full return to the Africa foundation is the real lesson of this capture... The christ message is an Africa story of the ressurection of the divine principle in man/woman THe divine principle of UBUNTU/MAAT called Shango or Heru that African used to grow and develop leaders. We taught the christ to Europeans to then chage thse message to a white jesus and used it capture and colonise ReAfricanizaion of our institutions based on the Africa world view is the solution We need new African MINDS free of the European world view and cultural values... The first principle of leadership is an understanding and committment to the principle of truth/ubuntu/maat. This is a proble in America and Europe...the leaders there is also capture to do the wishes of the 1%.
Mogale Ramokopa,üò•üò•
Mugisha Bashir,i doubt white people i know are all rich may be if ur confusing them with coloured people... i think it can bring joy & calmness to us black people if rich white people start donating their partly riches to black people coz remember all this divisions we see was brought by this guys. so i believe white + black=Joy love unity success peace freedom. so true Louis Eloff Honestly white people are gud people & i think the reason which makes them fear to support Eff z because of malema dangerous views on race. "Very true my dear Louis Eloff "sorry dear Louis cool dear Louis
Billy Makgapetja,There is time for everything
Andrew Marshall,So to between poor and rich black people @Louis Eloff True @Frans Phala @ Ntuthuko Buthelezi why would you want to do that? A whole minister What baffles me is that Zuma was able to get away with it Nothing really happened @Buyiswa Mnyani the only important this is Cheryls name is Cherly What is wrong with the Europeans system @Worlanyo Kponor how do you get to that conclusion The African approach superior? Strange the the state is not captured by any European countries Now I understand @Maat Community @Gareth Morgan They own 3/4 of it
Kopz Koape,@Louis..You say EFF are racist?..I'll tell u something they are NOT racist..Name one racist thing they have said? EFF is merely reacting to white racism..They speak the truth..They are not racist "@Louis..Remember that EFF had two white members..Those members left however @Louis yeah..Don't get it twisted I'm not a fan or supporter of EFF .. @Louis I was stating facts about EFF ..I have perceived them as a party fighting for equality..I never saw them as racist.. @Zoleka..Yes actually he quit due to pressure @G man keep quite I bet Zuma and many other top ministers won't be prosecuted that's how horrible SA legal system @Thembeka if that is the case then this state capture inquest is a waste of time they should be punished especially Zuma Eish it seems there is alot of crazies on this live chat..Weirdos waitse They won't learn from this Anc is rotten to the core and it will forever be corrupt Anc is going downhill..Down down Anc "That 500 billion could of been used to build schools "The problem as a citizen of SA and a voter who do I vote for when Anc is corrupt I suppose new parties will form in the future with young blood who can provide better leadership..I have lost faith in Anc and I havent lost hope for Mzansi @Mooki..Votsek wena..I say what I like..You don't like it then votsek sani
