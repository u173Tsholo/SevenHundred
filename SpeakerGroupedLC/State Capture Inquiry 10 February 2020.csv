Dominic Przybylski,Money laundering day today "Soon should be time for banks Memela has already dug a hole she cannot climb out of. Commission now has new powers to imprison witnesses who don't answer questions. Cannot believe that an advocate could have been so careless. I wonder what they do before 10:00? Most people start work at 8:00 @Phillip Cwazibe Thanks. It would be interesting to know what happens in a typical day in the life of Zondo. The witness' smile was more like a smirk while she seemed to believe that no-one would be able to fathom the money laundering. @Kevin She looks cute but she is lethal. Hoffmeyer eats little fish for breakfast. """like I mean"" Long answer which an honest person would simply answer yes or no - obfuscation.
Bra Eva Ndlela,We are all here waiting for Cuz Ms N Memela Adv Hoffmayer is the best
adam october,where is what I mean she's in a corner will she be there today
vincent kolobe,"if this memela women does not come to her sense today nervousness is kicking in now......I mean.....I mean.....is loading this spams are no different from the paid trolls you find on twitter or facebook
Mighty Mesolo,😅😅 anything is possible with Memela can they start already😢
Granny Mokwena,i hope she brought those papers to prove her story this commission is not serious about completing it's work! they're never on time. no lies detected
Elvis Malakoane,she will send a fake doctor's note today "The note will say ""I mean I am what I mean"" sick" just check if she did not hit a pole next to airport Scorpion Sting true she is nevers as devil in the church Rob she is not fit to Ruan a bath run a bath This lady is so nevours she is gonna cry soon this lady is loosing her head people any one has isidimeni contact numbers pastor j anyone closer my brother I am afraid she will hurt herself kokstad I think i like that Adv Hofmeyer never disappoint she geared up for them pastor j who were among known suspectc at pp 50th OK thanks pastor she is beginning to irritate me honestly she knows what she is doing wrong Narcissistic watch later in the day Adv Hofmeyer will make speak slower and rationally pastor j thanks sir pastor j I did not know that Mkhwebane is 50 I thought she is 60 or so she looks older Stronger together My condolences sir Pastor j his dad passed away and they had a funeral on Friday Pastor j do that for u now Bev Daniels and those amendments cane at the right time Pastor j yes I think arrest festivals are starting so if I marry a brilliant woman like Adv Hofmeyer i can't lie to her she will see through me -
Scorpion Sting,"I Declare today the "" Truth or Sting Day """ I bet she does not turn up today @Thandisizwe Yeleki ...Hiding in a dark corner. But I will find and sting her out ok @Elvis Malakoane ....Maybe she drives a Toyota? @Ria Sokiri ...Put your glasses or the lights on my Dear
Sherwin Peters,her lawyer might bring a sick note if she doesn't pitch 🤣🤣 it's like waiting for a cellular call centre agent to answer your call... let's do this already "here we go here we go again ... blah blah blah blah "haibo it's getting hot in here

Phillip Cwazibe,@ Granny Mokwena ​i She does not have them. She can not bring them because they implicate her. @Dominic Przybylski ​I Meetings and some administrative duties. @ Dominic Przybylski I missed his wedding because I was too baabalazed and avoided travelling. He was a friend to a friend. @ Rob Nel ​@emmanuel No Zungu are not same as Zuma....never.. two different tribes/clans @Pastor J ​I do @Elvis Malakoane . The further away from home the better. Try Kokstad "@ Esme Van Heerden that is why she did not understand ""conflict of interest""" What is attorney Mbanjwa saying. Judge Zondo educating an advocate. I do not think that Ms. Memela knew that there is a submission by the CEO. She is going to need an ambulance now. I missed it. Why are they having a break.
Thandisizwe Yeleki,where is she ? "i can""t wait to listen" Time waisting Miss Mbanjwa how can a goernment official do not record her duties because i do not understand Miss Memela she says she does not remember her part of duties Adv .Kate Hoffmeyer is sensing all these lies of Miss Memela Hoffmeyer's questions are very interesting it digs the truth Kate's questions are on point Miss Memela ndiyayithanda imibuzo kaKate Hoffmeyer i love Adv . Hoffmeyer memela talks too moch nonsense
Person of interest,"she's already in a deep hole "Kevin Warm for small fish... getting warmer Kate always in charge. especially of 🐠 going from frying pan into 🔥 "She was fighting for Bee Kate will straighten it out before lunch ok come with simple English lol Simple enough now Ms memela? "Jacquie "Pheladi "Very stressed 👍 👍 😂 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Desperation setting in punching above your weight Ms lawyer... Ms Memela you are making things worse for yourself if you continue to treat Ms Hofmeyr as public enemy No 1 "Kevin yes Kevin's surname is Hofmeyr
Paul Buchel,"Where are you? ""Lukkamien"" we are waiting." "@Rob Nel​ "@ Pastor J​ Pastor J😎😂😂 "Here comes the ""Lukkamien"" again." "Keep on smiling Memela "@Sam Monkoe​ @Smart Guys​ block them .it's easy "Eish
Ria Sokiri,"I can not see anything "at least someone told her to try and limit this thing of talking too much🤔 simple English please😅 lawyer 😁 Kate is spitting fire now her mouth is dry lol memela u talk too much
Yonam Daudi,where million are concerned about their is no advocate can resist that temptation
Smart Guys,delayed again Thanks they starting Myra Carol shut up answer yes or no
Rob Nel,An advocate with a lawyer "She is addressed as a lawyer "After every sentence @emmanuel zungu same as Zuma....never @Kevin I think she is HOT Love to know how many buttons on the dress she is wearing "Agree with Zondo She is a comrade that is why she got the job @anya van loggerenberg i agree
Karabo Moshoeshoe,I just hope we not gonna be hearing “Like I mean like”.... @Rob Nel: It’s like asking a nurse to examine a doctor.🤣😂
Bruce Andrew,"Maybe Im stupid Kevin Im with you on that... she's amazing Cold with occaisional jail sentences
emmanuel zungu,The question still standing. When will all criminals who collapse the SOEs are going to be Prosecuted???????????? @Philip Cwazibe 😂😂😂
Kevin,"The more I watch Adv Kate Hoffmeyer the bigger the ""crush""gets....Am i the only one huh ??" "That""s the attraction....hot...powerful...yet extremely feminine...." Hmmm nope....shes mine...i saw her first hahaha If I was Memela's lawyer I would tell her to shut up...ask for recess to be given handcuffs...put them on and re[port to jail... "Esme I think we are going to see the ""dark side""of Kate very soon...." The HOFF is going to put these two lawyers in a corner nobody can get out of. If i am your son Bev then you would be 85 years old plus some 😂 Bev what has Cyril done....in a few words ??? Fantastic.....thanks Bev For the life of me...How can someone as incompetent as Memela be appointed into the position of HOD procurement ??? It is just not logical. Myra i just can't get my head around this. Seriously. The entire country has been treated like mushrooms....stuck in the dark and fed bull...it When the HOFF's hairdo goes a little woes then she is getting irritated....hehehe
makhosi nobhatyi,This woman is not fit to run any SoE 😂😃😃😃😃@ Elvis Malakoane "Tell us whose big fish? You sounded as you know something Her chest is full Answer the question not prolonged Emsebenzini kaHulumeni akufuneki usebenze isikhaya or race but a competitive individual or company to do the job "I don’t think they mean that what they do is threaten those who give evidence showing that they are supporting Zuma Dwelling on is not going to work
Andre Ackerman,"Hi Kevin
Pastor J.J,"Did she say "" I mean"" at all today.?" Things will get very hot soon Nontsasa. They should replace the glass of water with a beeeeeeg Jojo tank. @Paul Buchel ...By the end of today I guarantee that your counter will be broken. I do @Elvis Malakoane . Can I give you Weskoppies and Sun City as well? "Nontsasa "" The Skelm"" Memela @Eliot Chauke" How did I miss that one @Phillip Cwazibe . @Elvis Malakoane ... I made the booking at Kokstad right now.

anya van loggerenberg,she does sound nervous it is an agent finish and klaar lolo lmaio stalling @Stronger together lol thats an insult to sumo wrestlers i like adv hoffmeyer @Jacqui Baumgardt i just did lol they dont do numbers well "avd hoffmyer is what competence looks like..everything is dated what link are you guys talking about Zondo should stop putting words in her mouth was that 22 5000 or 2 too 5000...it is so confusing if they dont say the full number someone please remind her that she is still under oath !!
Michael Michael,tody sounds like she is telling the truth. mama akana nyani she is lying
Eliot Chauke,greetings everyone... who is the witness? i just started watching danki🙏🏿🙏🏿 @Derek Main i agree. Hofmeyer is frustrating the process Memela wana assist... Hofmeyet is selective and only focus on the Narrative i ddnt watch on Friday once u lead Transformation... u become the target. just like ms Memela "Zondo shouldv called Ministers and DG's of all departments... CEO @Derek main. im Eliot
Santjie Ntuli,she's so brave i wonder whats the motive
Esme Van Heerden,"this lady has been trying to bring up BEE since last week i would be terrified to sit opposite this lady in any boardroom I think this lady is used to hearing her own voice only she is much more aggressive in her replies this week our current PP is 50
Ricus Ellis,"Dont worry
Derek Main,Morning all So the Zuma supporters say they are willing to die for him - they should be careful what they wish for - it might come true. I like that all the Zuma supporters are coming out of hiding - that way we know who we have to deal with. @Pastor J Morning Pastor - I didn't see that - let me Google first. @Pastor J Hmmm - very suspicious. Bongo beig there seems to confirm that she was indeed a spy before. @Pastor J Suppose it's not really a surprise. These ANC cadres are brazen in their criminality. Seems like this lawyer is just there to frustrate the process. @Eliot Chauke Very cute. @mandisi ntauzana Yes - Ms Memela is a consummate liar. "@mandisi ntauzana I don't think so - she has got ""crook"" written all over her. Any ANC cadre in procurement is almost certainly corrupt." @mandisi ntauzana It's the ducking and diving and unwillingness to just answer questions and the continuous smiling at the chair as if it is all a joke to her. "@Eliot Chauke ""Transformation"" has become a cover for corruption." @Lex Luger Still Memela from SAA Technical
Noah Kids,Like I said is now prepared
Chesa5,A lot.... Ooooh Yhoooooo
Matt Tshikota,how can u die for... not mch
Pamela Ledgerwood,"I would think that someone who is a Lawyer & Advocate "I thought if someone is employed in a high position with the nec qualifications
Loud Ramakgapola,kunzima
Jacqui Baumgardt,Morning Pastor J she's trying to lead her own evidence don't advocates speak at the same level @Person of interest it seems so @Pheladi Lamola agree She's trying to do a Zuma on the crowd bringing her own advocate to raise objections floccinoccnihilipilification sorry to hear. My condolences @Stronger together @Pastor J - his dad passed away Take charge Chair @Stronger together @Pastor J passes on his love and prayers "Put her in her place Please block Lhen @Elvis - you better believe it - lol! @anya van loggerenberg tx Loo calling Lekker uitgevang!
Maxwell Sibiya,lol. talking too much 😂😂😂
Gabisile Mabuza,what a disgrace this woman is how can a lawyer ask the advocate to use simple English
Vikes Sejato,lol..simple one please I SEE HIGH BLOOD THERE!
Jacob Seoe,Iyooo Memela she's trying to lead her evidence and this thing of her talking too much she forget some questions asks
Pheladi Lamola,There's some arrogance about Ms Memela that I don't like. It's almost as if she doesn't want to submit herself to Ms Hoffmeyer's questions. Chaos Ms Hoffmeyer has had enough of this woman's nonsense Is she not pressed for time anymore? I remember on Friday she said she could only avail herself for a specific period? I just saw it Bev. Thank you You're right @Nkululeko Mdluli. The problem is I'm being very inefficient today at work. She wants to wash her hands off this transaction but it's not possible. Or maybe she's protecting someone
Saresa Myburgh,how can she ask for an easier question - she is an advocate herself - she is acting stupid she is ARROGANT - full stop
Lungisani Ntshonga,few like I mean today may be later
Lorna Kavanagh,So ... the GPUs were bought a year earlier and SAAT decided to get Swissport to do the job and then SAAT sold the GPUs to JM. who sold them to Swissport .... ??? no doubt SAAT lost out big time. ms Memela is just trying to stall proceedings . Come now they are wasting time Is Memela holding up proceefings what a joke WHAT A JOKE... SHE IS STALLING
Dithato David,"what's happening guys
MIKE DURBAN,And also very loooong stories.......Mmmmmmm... Never a yes...or a no........ Gucci Gap lady........heheh Remember......what goes around.........always comes around.......true... Adv. Hoff is one of the best..........very impressed with her... She's clear and concise etc etc...... When one is guilty....one starts singing....heheheh Would be great if Adv. Hoff examines Zumatjie....now that would be fantastic.......
David Tuer,Memela is explaining the roundabout used by all these execs to disguise the reality of the transaction (theft).
Nielan Nagan,she is starting to sound like Sara lady at nugent enquiry
Buti Sipho,lol
Anne M.,Wow! Hello @Pastor J @Pheladi Lamola I thought the same thing @mandisi ntauzana and @Eliot Chauke Did you listen to the evidence on Friday? Condolences @Stronger together @Eliot Chauke Ms Mamela isn't as innocent as you think. Listen to Friday's evidence later if you can. DCJ knows - as always. @Pastor J I find Mortein quite effective 😉 @Bev Daniels Not in my area @Lex Luger Ms Mamela - prviously head of Procurement at SAA Technical
Masedi Matlala,Ms Memela though.....
Bev Daniels,they are stalling because Ms Hofmeyer only finished 17 of her 31 issues on Fri and this lady says she needs to get to East London today and stated that it must not go over 3 hours ...... @Pheladi Lamola see my note Bev Daniels @Pastor J same to you hope your day is fantastic "@Kevin "AS my son is called Kevin as well "@Kevin This advocate is talking absolute BS Ms Memela is going to be in big trouble as Cyril Ramaphosa has passed new rules in the Commissions can and cannot do????? "@Elvis "If people do not want to answer questions or step out of line "@Rosalind that answer was for you check out this site for the latest on the rules of the commission which I spoke about earlier. "Ms Hofmeyer is itching to go I am disappointed as loadshedding at 12 for me anybody else that is in Cape Town @Stronger together Zone 5
Nkululeko Mdluli,Eish things r heating up here no dull moment at all😰😰 "Miss Hofmeyer is like an energy drink @Carol-I L0v3 S3X it's called cadre deployment.
mandisi ntauzana,"Adv Memela is dealing with the questions nicely LOL @Derek Main you are being to harsh Awume @Derek Main what feature is Adv Memela's look is similar or looks like a crook?
FBS APPAREL,this lady is super guilty
Tich Ziny,Even I would be annoyed at the stupid interjection
Amanda Watson,The Commission has been running 18 months...17 of them this morning Only arrived here now @Pastor J How were you to know?
rosalind gerber,what clause? thanks @bev I thought mamela had pressing business in KZN today. @eliot is that what you call it oh crap @stronger together there is obviously chats here that irk who ever is responsible... condolences agreed @stronger together in downloading telegram right now. ground power units just sent you a message @stronger together what is it called... not seeing a link
Joe da silva,She’s lying through that big gap in her teeth BEE at its best hahaha Crooks Loot loot loot Mama you sweating too much The witch doctor is not helping her Simple English lol But like but like but like Like I mean South Africa will never come right when you have crooks running it Remember chair she’s a crook
funicanz,@Nkululeko Mdluli 😆😆 She is so evasive. "@Lorna Kavanagh  There is an invoice and yet no one agreed to the revised offer.
Erik Thiart,GPU as in Graphics cards?

RC Swart,Hofmeyr is on fire today

Meela Monyamane,This lady is not the smartest liar 😫
Bernard Matolino,"Morning folks @Anne M. @Derek Main Thanks guys This witness talks too much And she is an Advocate? "She lies "Uyakhuluma umuntu
Marcus Mmola,"I like the advocate`s cool demeanor Can the deputy judge allow the witnesses dig their own graves to extract the truth.Let the expose themselves.
Herbert Neely,;; ; ;
Holiday Puzzles,"Her lawyer must have told her to stop with the ""I mean like"""
Robin Boyes,GPU as in Ground Power Units - hooked into aircraft to provide power to the aircraft whilst it is parked on the apron.
Felix /Uirab,"The real judgement day is still coming
Brian,It is as simple as saying I DECIDED! Please just own up!!!!! Difficult to believe!! F(INALLY NOTHING gets past Mz Hofmeyer! Carol. do you have a stuttering finger? LOL
Eugene Rudman,when they said 'all rise' she heard it as 'all lies' 😀
