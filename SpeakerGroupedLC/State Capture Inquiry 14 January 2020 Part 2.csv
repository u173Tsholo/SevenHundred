I am now a poor and retired Pastor. @Jabu Malinga Connect with me on email and I will share with you a piece I wrote many years ago about crooked Pastors and the article was published globally. You will be interested.
Anne M.,My thoughts exactly. And the witness was not at the witness table when DCJ came into the room. @redriger Yes I might have missed it. Did he say why he was using a gmail account for work? "@Waco Tx This is a South African commission @Jabu Malinga Have the Hawks been informed? "@Jabu Malinga Well actually "@Jabu Malinga Sadly @Cerebis Possibly. "@MIKE DURBAN Problem is "@Concerned South African We all know I think DCJ is making sure that his findings and instructions can't be overturned in court.
Jabu Malinga,d fight back is on. Gordon hounds r out. they want to steal again corrupt as Eskom will never allow corruption to stop "zuma busy doing as we all knew has d npa arrested or prosecuted any1 in capture yet? years hav past "after all these years even Hillary Clinton and trump are using private emails kooleboose mr aurora mine theft zuma "can I also go and get ""assisted"" ter" zuma will die before seeing the inside of a prison. that's a gaurantee did any1 here about the guptas of the south coast of kzn? bankrupted the entire water board . now ppl cannot get water "Commision must not just look on a national level.billions are being stolen at local government level and d poor hav no taps Pastor J.. do u need the gupta name to do as the guptas did?hahahaha.. its a racket my man..theft and greed and he is a pastor lik u.maybe that y u interested...hahahah "a fake pastor did any1 here about the guptas of the North west???

Tessa N,Lets go and end this SA corruption JAIL TIME COMING!!!
roza,hi pastor yes sir hope u are blessed for the new year
James Godloza Godloza,@redridger ohhh my friend that would be so great to see Zuma laughing as he thinks he had once again evaded the law like his friends unfortunately they got sick after being convicted the likes of shab Shabbir but he might be really sick i don't think taking a shower had really helped the chairman is scared to look at those medical records I don't think any one wants to know about others status
makhosi nobhatyi,Zuma look after his own family and friends "Kuyanyiwa apha Zuma is going down slowly We all know Zuma doesnâ€™t take ownership always pointing fingers to other people while he hide himself behind the laws and enjoy protection from the ANC now they must come up tell us truth Husband of Zizo ðŸ¤ªðŸ’ƒðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³

Neville Watson,"This guy was kick out because of his honesty
Phillip Cwazibe,Some chats reflect Low IQs @ Itumeleng Rathebe â€‹what happened to Minister Chabane? He died n a car accident on the N1 (MHSRIP)
Rory Lee Farnham,Every individual had the opportunity to whistle blow. Those that took the opportunity MUST be protected. That is the law. "I do believe the big thieves like Magashule
Oscar Maela,better to talk now
Kevin Simon,African Refugee ..Is a BOT. Just block. QED Surely by now we should know JGZ does NOT want to appear before the Commission. JGZ does not care about our opinions of him. History repeats itself. If he wanted the truth known he would testify. Zondo has rules he must comply with else his findings will be challenged procedurally. Not so with the State Capture criminals.
MAMBO SASA TV,African refugee you don't have an ethics just change your mind ..but I hope you have bad image comper to zum African refugee just ask your mind what I'm saying
Lungisani Ntshonga,@Anne agree with you
Itumeleng Rathebe,some people don't want the Truth to come out... ask yourself why?

GabrielMooreTv,NDL NDL
mgebe Sibula,Zuma lied and said he is sick he won't be available to testify
Thamsanqa Nomayela,He qualified with the advert.
Cerebis,"What is wrong with the DCJ? He seems very annoyed at something? If he is unhappy with the evidence leaders
David Setlhabi,There goes some more money for nothing part 2 2020
