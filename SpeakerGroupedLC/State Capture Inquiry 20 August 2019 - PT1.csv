Siyabonga Dube,white monopoly capital this is only serving the interest of white monopoly capital we need nasrec state capture inquiry #CR17 we can't have a president who is buying votes. he doesn't trust himself to win elections. #CR17 state capture inquiry
makhosi nobhatyi,It’s a black monopoly capitalist behavior @ Siyabonga Dube 😃😃😃😃 not you per say please don’t be personal brother @Siyabonga Dube You see now you are making no sense if you want inquiry it’s fine I agreed with you but should start at Polokwane conference which Zuma who won as elder insist you must be fair "Ramaphosa is not corrupt Only one captured former President Zuma "Mbeki and Mandela took us and put us in a better position to be number 1 traders in Africa and well developed country but Zuma downgrade us things become worse than it was "This man has nothing concrete to bring here instead of trying to confuse himself as guilty as he "What we don’t want our leaders did is when they reach higher must not come down and take what it belongs to us this clearly evidence 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ this man doesn’t make any sense cross examination is coming "This man reminds me Supra mahumapelo attitude when his own province put under administration because there was no money Chair chair chair all the time..... answer the question mr Tjooo Mis Gcabashe is tired of this witness coz he is running away to answer directly questions "😂😂😃😃😃😃 Yhoo mr Thabethe is running away miss Gcabashe not missing him  Judge is getting tired now you can hear his voice @Ewald Kruger 😃😃😂😂 this man thinks he is clever but truth is out they took the money left those old people with nothing From the beginning @Jabu Nhlanhla You did not agreed after you use money? You are alone now sir floating with this mess where are your buddies surely they will throw you here and leave in the sea just to save their skin Does he know those docs? I doubt it Mr Thabethe disagrees with the report made by himself @ goolamv 😂😂😃😃 poor man is in trouble more witness will come to testify as they don’t agree with him Kushubile la How can you put someone who are not speaking any South Africans official languages ? How are you going to understand then? This was a Guptas farming Justification makes lot of confusion "@Ryan Smith you are making any sense now "@ Ryan Smith is still on the process as you heared King of Zulu threatens war which is a problem there "Ace Magashule is going to cracked surely now they are prepared to do something to save their skin by removing Ramaphosa "Free state must be ashamed now those who defend Ace Magashule and Zwane "Nkandla saga "@ Gee peex1 what I don’t understand is that Parliament went to Nkandla to investigate the structure which cost over 200 million This man doesn’t know English 2016??🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️ "Pathetic liar Thabethe I had enough of you Coughing a lot in the house people start to get tired of you Thabethe "Hayi uyaxoka nangu umuntu habe nimzwa kahle nje Thanks @ Jacob Zuma Don’t entertain Zuma here
Adziambei Moses,Mr president under Mr president undermine some of ensure pls done the job to create economy pls vhavenda nakale nakale vhanzhielwa fhasi pls show them Mr president done the best job Mr zondo don't forget v b s we need solution for that pls venda imaninga ngamilenzhe.
Mbombi,"the Commission started early today I agree with you Dube All president are captured don't lie lol old Vaseline 🙈 "this is politics "if you don't know this guy get out of here lol just kidding Swart I'm also confused now I wonder how much cash has been used for this commission after 1 year and who own this venue thats hosting "thanx Pastor I dont blame him who's report is this Adv Molefe is my crush alone stay away 😁 😃 Lead us Mr Thabethe he has corrected himself. we can move on now it's tea time chair I'm back did I miss anything I got bored with this proceedings unconfirmed news coming up 6 DA Members who have been identified on the CR17 Bank Statement who were receiving Payments from Cyril Ramaphosa in 2017 before the Nasrec Conference some UDM leaders are also being questioned in relations of being recipients of money from the CR17 Campaigns Soon enough we will know all those people; ku-rough in SA. Heads are rolling #RamaphosaLeaks She will fail as PP yes the judge is in a comedy show lol
Mthobisi Zuma,"Zuma warned us about those masquerading as angels New dawn turned out to be old vaseline sarcasm I guess we as south Africans should be grateful that we can still engage in politics and condemn our leaders in other African countries it's rough no freedom at all
Born free,Zuma is one of many masquerading as an angel. CSOS (Community Schemes Ombudsman Services) must also be investigated. I am still waiting a year later for my case which was referred to adjudication only to find that the case file is closed because they have no Adjudicator and I have paid them money a year ago. This is why you can't just be given land for nothing... imagine the RISK As Independent Provinces Clinton's definitely linked to Epstein. Prince Andrew has been to Epstein's Island of debauchery. Farms linked to the Guptas. Trump is not a paedophile.. Wish we had a President like Trump. Imagine creating 6 million jobs in under 3 years. Cyril plans to create 2 million jobs in 10 years.. The cattle were slaughtered and used to feed the ANC at their election party in 2014 Trump is not a paedophile. That is a fact. 🤣🤣 Trump may have had a few affairs years ago and that's a private issue between him and and his wife. Trump has done nothing wrong and will be elected in 2020. Yes but Zondo chose not to to recluse himself. Derek knows he is talking rubbish about Trump. Derek must be a liberal only liberals talk like that about Trump. Derek has disappeared 🤣 It means no borders in life at all. 🤣🤣🤣yes Derek Diss and Day.. I will research that topic and get back to you.👍 I hope my Thai Lime tree bears fruit before 3 years. Yes Derek.. love the Trump 😚😚 Be nice DEREK Getting interesting..... It seems that he has only one understanding.. that of his Own. They delete all the chats 🤣🤣🤣For sure Jacob. they DIDI.. is that the Sydney Opera House? are you in Australia? True story.. Jacob No I am agreeing with a fact Yes
Manfred Nkonki,@Thami Nobela HaHa thats just the game of politics Eh this guy changing his evidence from 3 plans to 3 projects. @Phumlani Ranyana Because they are not affected by it or...? The adv must chillax Not to take anything away from the purpose of the TRC..but state capute enquiry = TRC

Yes.waiting for all the evidence This men should tell the truth nd finish to long story. Yen Yang will take anther 25 years To sad about the cows .they should give all the poor people that cows 🤣🤣😂😂😂 chair you right it's to much for his brain I don't think that Prasad knows about cattle feed. Paras is vegetarian. maybe he bought soya Beena for the cattle I ment beans Yes you tight right when is Supra and Ace coming to the commission Eish Tax payers money😥😥😥😥 shem so true Mmmmm chair giving the answer.

Thabang Letsosa,He is not helpful at all.
Thembisa Odendaal,Ms Gcabashe is not impressed and she does not like a runaround not even from the chair...i like her temperament I remember those days because I studied in the EC students who were not sharp they place them in the agriculture class to help them to pass @ pastor j yes agriculture or religious studies @bedazzled 😂😂hold up wena I did needlework but clearly they were wrong because at varsity I did accounting and statistics far from double stitching @pastor J true but that was then now they won't pass religious studies because it's too analytical you must study Greek etc but then just ukucengceleza Ms Gcabashe tough cookie my kind of girl not gonna let it go @Olam but people wear glasses for different reasons perhaps for him it is to see far so it makes sense that he would take them off when looking near @pastor J it should be the extra dry range "I mean this dude only studied four types of soils Sandy soil his mouth is so dry he could keep a biscuit the whole day and we would not find out @pastor J more like a pull him down (PhD) I forgot the fourth one if there were 4 but totally not the point I would like a job like this playing with millions of tax payers money umrabaraba @Abel another thief amongst many
