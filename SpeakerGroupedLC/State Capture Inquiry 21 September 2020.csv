Gray Lawrence,who is on the hot seat today?
Lezil Lezil,how does one reply to someone's comment? it's been a while when I hold the @ names dont come up I know right! @Kerry I see the names its probably cause I'm on my mobile thanks will switch
Yolo More,@Mfundo GM chomma. How are you? @Thobani Mkananda you need to apologise to me and Pastor first.😅 Thankyou chair @Thobani Mkananda no. The crew is here😅 @Thobani Mkananda dankie my skat.
a b c,This day has started on an interesting note... @Lezil if you're using a mobile phone then you may not see names But the respondent will be highlighted in red on their side He'll need all the legal advice he can get... "He'll be ""sick"" again on the 9th..." Zuma chickened out @Bev... Or a plane ticket to India... @Mariam lol Oh look... Masa's back... yay lol @Blake Yogi Indeed... we're literally going around in circles if we don't interrogate the head of the issue... Nah... he's pro-Zuma @cassim so I don't think he's EFF... yeah... that mentality worries me for the future of SA "Well it'll be fair if Zuma appears so he can answer questions "@Blake Yogi... I've just realized also... a shame "@Blake Yogi exactly... it's one of the reason that some of these crimunals go free in the first place Sup Canis... Oh it's the old man again... I hope he had a red bull or two this time... Indeed Off to that cheese sandwich again ey Zondo... "Yes... I feel like if they question JZ properly we'll make a huge step forward @Blake Yogi Indeed! "Btw guys if you ever get upset over people's opinions "@Sam Monkoe Really? I should definitely search it out Do you have evidence of the Americans having a part in the state capture? @Masa I've never been so close to blocking someone before Pretorius is definitely on point with this one... "He's got a full understanding of the situation so it seems @Blake Yogi 100% @Andre Gerber lol that's true... @Mdue he's a creep... pay him no heed... "He's prolonging the inevitable He's tired from coming up with excuses and lies last night @Blake Yogi The old man is being pushed into a corner... 😂😂😂 "You won't lie to Pretorius so easily @Blake Yogi LOL I think so too... @Andy Pett True... "Or ""I forgot that I remembered""... he said it in every way possible..." Wrong chat for Ronaldo fella... @Cool Kruger they've started the oven... mince meat will be ready soon They are given a crash course before joing @Carmen *joining Lol yeah... he looks soft boiled 😂😂 @Gift it's not us... it's Masa... He's been at it since this morning @Kruger 😂😂😂 The old man didn't make the best decisions in life... That's because he knows there's no way out... The old man is already starting to look confused... Let's sanitize the country... get rid of the ANC @Andre Gerber I don't think the world has such a supply... Maybe if the ocean was sanitizer... When the poor in rural areas see those yellow ANC shirts they get excited and vote ... it's a shame because they don't see the light... @Blake Yogi that's the paradox that makes the situation complicated... people don't trust the DA and the EFF are warmongers... Also the other parties are also quite messed up @Monica 😂😂😂 Oh no... another ANC disciple I'd vote for a party that fixes the economy and gives out free burgers on Fridays... lol Ok... maybe the burgers are a lot ro ask for @Ozzy Ozzy true that @Cerebis 😅 2024 will be interesting however all the racial tension may also influence people's votes... though I'm for any particular party at the moment @visibly annoyed tell him... I don't know why people keep saying stuff like that "All that's certain is that if something is not done Parties win... but the people always lose... Hi cousin

Blake Yogi,Today we are back at this Free state Asbestos saga. May the case be cracked wide open the way they did Eskom. "Chair "@Thobani each advocate is assigned to different segments of corruption "Yeah true. I learnt that even by watching. It seems like it became too much for 1advocate "Didnt Zuma Say He cant wait for his day in court because he wants to tell ""the real truth""? so why keep on running like a little child. so glad Chair has had it with that ish" Because Zuma is the one we wanna hear. He is the one who must answer many unanswered questions and been implicated by many witnesses. He needs answers. Pravin will have his turn Its prioritizing. "Nobody said Pravin wont come again "Only Zumas fans and lovers will think its unfair that he doesnt come. Justice "@a b c I can already see we are talking against a wall. You are so right "@a b c "@ cassim the NPA wont be getting drips and draps. Only once things are concluded will 1 full report be given with prosecution recommendations of ALL those Zondo decides based on the evidence. pls understand @Herb . Great question. We will only know once he has given answers and findings are unearthed @skeet you are right. I blocked. We dont have time for those who want to deflect attention from the heart of corruption "@Bev that is why chair gave the final say about that. He cant run anymore. "@a b c very correct. Even lies @Sam I read that article this morning. Shocking. Im so glad that it is not up to SA alone to bring Guptas to justice I am still wrapping my head around it. This needs international resources and work to bring them to book. Imagine how many more will be implicated abroad "I have to admit @Tumelo great question @Andre. You are wasting your precious energy. That is a superfan you wont get anything right there 😱 Did this guy just say not everything that looks like fraud is fraud😶 @Andre Gerber definitely by me. We are not here to defend any implicated peeps. They have legal reps for that Oh It was irregular. Not fraud. Ok nice Simantics @Cain he must come explain to us then cos Im totally gobsmacked by those words "@Andre "@Kgotso Perv alert @Canis definitely. This isnt a room for that. He must sms 31314 for that I blocked too. Insulting chair doesnt make anyone greater or wiser @Carmen definitely not "@ Ayanda Pretorius studied them docs inside out. He is coming for you. These investigators are🔥🔥 "@ Carmen "Theres a reason why Pretorius is Head evidence leader. If you wanna lie to him "@Kgotos you are right. he will end up crying and confessing. Like a priest "@Thobani @Thabo his stacks of lies are too heavy thats why he is tired. 🤣🤣🤣 Speak up! whats up with this meek and mildnesss "Stutter @a b c he put himself in that corner @ a b c. Pretorius is also an old man so let the old man put the old man in the corner. its only fair 😅 no answer You do know!! This witness is soo soo intelligent. But now he is acting like he didnt even pass grade 1 who remembers how Ndezu said he couldnt mastermind a fraud plan cos he has zero education🙈 @a b c he is back with fire. I think he knows this case even better than himself @Carmen what I meant is he is so highly educated. He understands exactly what is being said but his lies got him bound he is acting as if he only passed grade 2 😱😱😱 I think this witness should just fake a heart attack right now @Carmen that PA who pretended she was trying to be helpful who couldnt remember her birthday gifts That PA thought she would dominate the session but Notshe finished her by bringing in Agrizzis PA😅 "@Canis "@Carmen the reason ""For the sake of completeness"":elbowcough:love all these phrases they taught us" @ Cerebis Did he remember you? I dont recall:elbowcough: "@Andy 😱😱😱 At least you are confessing now. the lies are too much for this mans heart now. Maybe he will recharge lies R29 during lunch "Not everything that looks like fraud "@Thabo @mulungisi he wont shem. he is Nyama "@Carmen "" I dont recall""" @bux the Hawks will come when they are called "Using your intelligence to manipulate the system "@sammy 😭😭😭😭 R500 million "@Singi "@Carmen "@Carmen "@Gift I agree. It takes such brains to create this kind of scheme @Kevin😭😭😭 @Tony that is his tail sign. We know he is about to lie when he does that "SA has a bigger problem "Russell "@a b c @ Monica 😅😅😅🤣 Our country is brainwashed into believing ANC is the only black party. And any other party would mean we give land back to the white minority "@ Monica Think carefully before answering Pretorius. He wont forget and he will uproot them lies No you cannot Imagine saying Chair said so "Lets all blame Chair He bana this witness @Amanda. the signs of a liar deluxe

Thobani Mkananda,@Fred Desrosiers He is not going to drop the ball 💥😎 They are late as usual 🤣 @Yolo More I figured the problem is with my email function. I can't send emails but I received your email last week. Please just email me your contacts and I'll send a shout on WhatsApp I've blocked Bheki so that I'll have the clarity of thought. It serves me well 🤣🤣 @Yolo More and @Pastor JJ I hereby apologize. I had technical problems that disallowed me to respond to both your emails. I profusely apologize 😁🙏🏾 @Fred Desrosiers I have just blocked @Bhekithemba Masa because I can't think straight with all him on my screen @Yolo More You're welcome @Yolo More Is @ENCA not covering today's proceedings? @Yolo More 🤣I'm looking forward to the crew's contribution then 😅 Welcome as usual. We are one! 😁💕 @Kgotso Mpete Where has Adv. Pretorius been @Yolo More 🙏🏾💕😎 Thanks @Blake Yogi I guess we have just gotten virtually acquainted with the commission's evidence leaders so much Thanks my brother @Kgotso Mpete 🙏🏾 @Freddy Pummer Was he not originally scheduled to appear this week? Instead of appearing he urgently sent a letter through his attorneys putting forward lofty reasons? @Freddy Pummer Hence the summons on that date for a fixed dates in November unless the chair receives compelling reasons for not being able to honour those dates. . . @Cassim Suleman I feel you 🤣🤣 @Xolile Titus 🤣🤣 That judge got the DCJ so angry that one 🤣😂 I can't seem to recall @Carmen James You've done yourself a favor. He's one individual that is a liability to this community's intellectual bank 🤣😂 "@Carmen James He needs to be starved of attention by people who choose not to block "@Carmen James It would help this witness to make up his mind to keep with the truth @Andre Gerber There's a case that the CC will hand down a ruling on in due course. The ANC is deeming coalition gov unworkable due to undue absence of its councillors in the council of Tshwane @Andre Gerber Exactly they are determined to undermine coalition governance. What was interesting in those proceedings at the CC was they were not available to make submissions. What was that about? "@Andre Gerber I followed all the way through. It's seems the ANC doesn't want to cooperate in coalition governance

bekithemba masa,they are late coz their planned attack on why Zuma hasn't attended will expose hypocrisy on why Pravin is being left alone "Dubai nonsense doesnt exist  "let those Indians come to give evidence at the inquiry "pravin chooses not to appear "appearance is the issue  "the double standards just to get at Zuma are amazing  "if Zondo is practising such double standards "I expected that from Zondo  "I m pro fairness "all gossip will not be admitted as evidence in any court  "Media has been singing about ARMS DEAL  "as long as #Zondo cant explain why he neva issued summons to Pravin  I wish this very same scrutiny is applied to tender corruption of Covid R500bn funds which is being swept after the carpet "Prestorius talks about bidding process  "the law turns only to those that are targets  "the first person who must go to jail is Ramaphosa "the SOE corruption happened under Ramaphosas nose  tbe reason why they wont be any prosecution is becoz investigations are done according to who media wants to lynch not becoz of corruption as a whole . so does it make it right "Give us the evidence that others recieved it too  cr17 Thumaminions never see thru their wrongs but will sift thru the exact wrong they are doing and make issue coz others did it . yah Neh "when Philips came out to spill the beans about VBS look at how the story died down  "u cant accuse JZ of being corrupt then u fail to put that evidence to that regard  "which court is JZ trying to avoid by the way  "why ? Zuma  "u convince any one thru evidence not gossip  "pple need to be factual when debating matters  "Zondo wants Zuma to answer Eskom issues yet it was Ramaphosa who was running the SOEs  "there is nothing special about USA or london issuing anything over the Guptas coz they are part of the driving force behind statecapture the West poles its nose into SA business but hear how they squeal over interference in their own affairs . that's very lovely indeed "it's not news that the West was deeply involved in SA politics Bank of Baroda records are available with FIC or SARB by the way "pple want to ignore facts where it doesnt suit their agenda  "if Gupta did any corruption in SOEs how did Ramaphosa not pick that up  "that's better Francis  mankoe does that apply to Ramaphosa too or it's only meant for Zuma "Andre that's what we want Ramaphosa to tell us  "Keith do u know why NPA is dragging its feet on that info  "the problem in SA is that certain corruption scandals must be attributed to Zuma alone yet the involvement of many others is deliberately ignored  "I would gladly be happy to see every standard required of Zuma being applied fairly to everyone  "Zuma must take the blame as he was Pres  "Andre there are a lot of pple implicated in the state capture but pple cant chose who to pick on coz they dont like "Corruption in this country has always existed "Statecapture has always existed in SA  "George  "pple hate the truth  "no Ayanda "it's this selective behaviour that's problematic "thank you Canis  "Zuma agenda makes this inquiry a circus "Ayanda CR17 is not an internal ANC matter when CR donors are found in gvt tenders  Ayanda as a taxpayer I m paying for tenders that CR17 donors are getting as we speak. their donations are far from a Pvt affair when their noses appear in gvt spheres "The commission has failed to provide facts on how JZ is implicated except gossip  "There is one thing I wont deny  "Listening to the inquiry "As a Pres Zuma couldnt be every where or watch each individual "if Ramaphosa cant be held responsible for R500bn covid corruption why must Zuma be held responsible for Eskom  "Andy they must provide it "Yes Andy he is not required to remember everything "Zuma was required to give an opinion about a conversation that occured btwn Ajay & Maseko that he was not part of  "Andy why must he admit to things that had nothing to do with him  "Zuma is 80yrs old  "How many interactions with ministers does a Pres have in a day  "Pravin couldnt remember a lot of things when he appeared at the commission "Andy there is nothing wrong with any Pres being with business pple "Sahara computers were all over Gvt departments all becoz of Mbeki relationship with the Guptas  "thank u Russel  "Zuma wont appear as long as Pravin hasnt  "I tell u right now had Pravin appeared  "Singi didnt Ramaphosa take the same oath "the Poor have been suffering since Mandela came to power  "pple were corrupt in gvt departments

Sounds like a plan Listening to Advocate Pretorius....this is a BIG MESS Just blocked him @Thobani Mkananda . Eish....That is not what we are here for. @Thobani Mkananda . Please starve him of attention. Unfortunately I have a very low tolerance threshold. LOL! @Blake Yogi . Hehehe..... Well done @Thobani Mkananda @Cerebis . Pretorius was not resting.....He was doing his research. The witness is very uncomfortable.... I agree @Thobani Mkananda Please explain to us what has happened to change your mind! Lies causing loss of hearing! His own counsel argued that the scheme was fraudulent!!!! @thembisa odendaal . That shocks me the most. All these old people lying to the Commission. Do you know him @Blake Yogi ? He is so evasive. Seems scared. Thanks @Blake Yogi . Got it. He is so hesitant.....Reminds me of Nomvula's P.A. I agree @Blake Yogi . Pretorius is only warming up. I don't know why it was necessary.....Oh my Word!!!! @Sifundo Mazibuko . LOL!!!!! @Blake Yogi . So do I. Can't tell you how much I missed this Commission last week. LOL! Cry the beloved Free State! Where did they learn all this crookery? Is there a special school for government thieves? @Blake Yogi . Eish......No claim to cede but cessions were signed. How?????? Payments in excess of 500 million made with no lawful cause!!!!! He admits fraud and there are no consequences ???? @Blake Yogi . Hopefully in my lifetime. I am a madala just like these crooks..... 5 years later.... 2010.....0 houses 0 houses but 600 million spent. Lord help us! The poor people.......no houses while contractors earned millions for doing nothing. @Gift Mazibuko The contractors were probably politicians masquerading as contractors.

What a pity they can't put their egos aside and work together in the interests of the country. @Peter Staffen . Sadly we all lose😓
Fredy Pummer,Just to clarify that Showerhead will have to confirm that he will appear from 16-20 October 2020. If he doesn't then Zondo will proceed with a summons on 9th October
Andre Gerber,a troll in the house named Masa If Ramaphosa was in charge of SOE's WHY did Zuma get involved masa I don't agree masa. then Zuma should not have gotten involved.
