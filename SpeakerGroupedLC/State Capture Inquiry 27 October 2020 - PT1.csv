She is Celia Malahlela Former Exec for Supply Chain Management. Earlier news reports seem to indicate she is not implicated. @Cooler Cat I am not surprised at all @Cooler Cat The reports on the news says her name appears on the charge sheet/docket @too ez What dont you understand? @Anne M. Sadly and disturbingly so many chose to or continue to insult woman on this chat. @R E How are you doing Aunty Roza @R E You ignored my earlier message @Naledi Barron You are the sweetest girl around . Thats so nice to hear Goodbye til we chat later again. Off to lunch to celebrate my granddaughters birthday.
Heather Durr,Dear All Hello It was great to see Gerrie Nel again This evidence leader is lacking in evidence leadership skills With respect this lady has a trying name This leader is blind Where did they find this man Was Senzo assassinated like Gerrie said Level 3 waits for us Answer please-Was Senzo assassinated DCJ is not impressed with her offhand matter Oh Lord she is driving us all crazy I dont trust Cele Ok now I need a tequilla You must stock up this week @Paul Buchel But Gerrie has nothing to do with the case Look at DCJ madam Oh for heavens sake-get new glasses GET NEW GLASSES EVIDENCE CONFUSER @Naledi Barron Hi Naledi 😉 The first lady yesterday was way more beautiful @elton van neel Hiiiii:) "NOOOOOOOOO. You must say ""Is that correct??'" She is wearing foundation and powder that is why her face is not shiny DCJ has fallen asleep "USA sold to Saudis @elton van neel That was the USA who kidnapped a German to build the Atomic bomb on Nagasaki in WW2 @Naledi Barron correct I think he defected to the USA "Robert Oppenheimer was the 'father of the atom bomb' in 1945 Tea Time Evidence Misleader Senzo case all over the TV Tea yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay @Garrison Shilongo The first woman yesterday was to me the most beautiful Level 3 US Elections next week @Lee D.

Then why do they need Gerrie if it is so simple @Sanjay Maharaj Thank you! Cele is involved in everything-he ie corrupt to the bone @Tums tum tum That statement is unacceptable DCJ is annoyed that she is so disrespectful and offhand She finishes his sentences and acts like she is in charge
Gerard Victor,He should be taking on Malenema and Zupta "Its coming Keep this ones passport if she is in Europe @ JOHANNES MOSELANYANA All i want is Zuma in JAIL!!! "What was the reason behind the ""HIT""" @ Simphiwe Kubheka ​ and killed by his own people? @ Sibusiso Cilo Led by Cele its no surprise The educated liar is stumbling here "@Mzalwane Mzala Educated whites that had to pass properly and not with 30% "@ Vuyisani Sikobi then why was there a brain drain after 94 @ Sanjay Maharaj I totally agree I am not arguing the fact-just that post 94 it became reverse apartheid and the country started going downhill then just gathered pace into junk as being led by thugs "She is so condescending-Karma is coming
Richard De Klerk,Almost Gerrie? "Morning Salmaan and where can I get bulk sigarette for selling

Arthur Kona,There is clear evidence that the criminal board members moved from one SOE to another together with criminal executives. It is also clear that some board members did not know what the Guptas & their proxies were up to for example Ms Madindi @ the Denel Board.

Once the Goat is here u all get scared because u can't beaf him respect the Fire Who owns the land in SA???? @Naledi Balarooon are u married there?
SanFran Arnold,@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee hello "Adv. Paul Kennedy Adv. Paul Kennedy: He has acted on various occasions as a judge in the High Court and the Labour Court and regularly sits as an arbitrator. "@Moss I can get it for you @ALTA morning skat :virtualhug: @Moss It is on the website - The Bridge group of Associates "The commission is on of enquiry. It does not have the powers to arrest. That is up to the NPA. So for finding out the truth @Naledi Barron He is on the Transnet work stream @Naledi Barron Lady N :virtualhug: @R E you are welcome Hi @Anne M. I only recall it being in Denel This guy is on FB here
xx xx,😁 Wipe malema of the media podium. He is really only bad news for the people of this country. I am to attend a webinair at 07h00 GMT..would be what time in Cape Town? Is uncle Ray turning a little deaf-ish? I agree Naledi. I jus wonder if he needs a hearing test? I adore this Uncle Ray of ours MICHAEL!!!!!! +
Aubrey De Bliquy,So it's obviously not all corruption. Some very competent young black professionals have served well in difficult circumstances. Denel has always been the gem in SOEs. "@potwana potwana Yes Well we have problems but I reckon we also have the spirit to prevail. I'm just not always sure as Mandela said that your enemies are our enemies. Wo are we South Africa? who? @Lee D. Hendrix Cheap. Just your soul. unless you have the money to fund yourself which was Trumps problem. He funded himself. Hi Naledi. I don't mind the Trolls. They provide all the ammo we need bro. @Naledi Barron whoever is allowing us to talk more and fight less is our friend. Thanks "The lifeblood of our thriving young democracy "@Heather Durr Trump is their spiritual superior in a sense exactly @Rob Nel Biden publicly proclaimed himself a prostitute for corporations. It's been downhill for him since. @too ez LOL @Fred Desrosiers Someone was calling him corrupt and someone else said biden was worse. Just setting the record straight. Nobody is perfect @Rob Nel I prefer Jimmy Dore the commedian. If we don't laugh we may cry. LOL "@Fred Desrosiers True @Gerard Victor I think she is doing well. Strikes me as professional. They are putting her on the spot. @Fred Desrosiers China has become a moral victor in real time. Even her alleged crimes are orchestrated by predatory corporate cabal who could care less about the mayhem their greed provokes.. A lawyer can be like having a hammer. Every job has to look like a nail. He is looking for a bogey man. @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA I think he would make an excellent chief justice. We are lucky to have such professional legal minds in our judiciary. @Simphiwe Kubheka It will take more than a voice to capture me if I was up for capture. LOL What they don't understand is that this is high tech. Your supplier base is severely constrained. Successful tenders have to be vetted or you are go bakrupt if you are competing internationally. I think she is doing well. Remember she can only answer what she is asked. Who you gonna vote for. Personally I have no clue. @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA I still prefer the painfully slow rule of law than public witch hunts. Just as I expected. This lady is professional and not lacking in integrity. "@Gitsa Mpofu exactly. Corruption does not discriminate about it's victims either. All they have is this nationality I don't think she is being untruthful at all.
eliasmnisi72,Bhotani mawethu @Simphiwe Kubheka she is implicating the Big fish the commission is interested at/in All rise

Mzalwane Mzala,'South Africa belongs to all who live in it' (Freedom Charter). That clause is not anti-land reform. Where @Simphiwe Kubheka ? There were many documents in South Africa as there are still many documents today. People believe in different things but what is binding us now is the constitution of the country @Simphiwe Kubheka . Corruption is bad and it is in both the public and the private sector. That's sad @Simphiwe Kubheka "Majority means @Tums tum tum The vast majority of people in South Africa are black so it is not a shock that many people you hear of in this commission are black and this does not deal with private sector corruption @Gerard Victor When I still had an Honours Degree a senior guy called me a affirmative action appointee. Unfortunately for him I was in HR and I checked his file and saw that he studied up to STD 6. @Louis C Read the annual employment equity reports to see that it is a fact. @Naledi Barron They must appear in court.
