Cordelia Mabena,morning
Future Seokotsa,Third of the Gordan lecture
Aza Bam,bn
Frans Phala,"he looks tired "eff is playing mind games on him zuma and bathabile did say should any member of the anc reveal his\her dirty laundry they will reveal their dirty laundry ANC is bad the anc is divided into two parties within itself "is it possible that pravin testimony is the same story "@Thando Nkutha he is leading the question of the commission huh
Marvel Ramatshela,what now SABC??
Egbert Mkoko,what???
benjamin Maluleke manyunyu,"he is shaken by malema Gordhan must clarifies the allegations that he was involved in fund raising for the Zuma's re-election in 2012 &we all know that the Gupta funded the campaign the mandate of Gordhan is to tries all by means to implicate JZ and this strategy is not going to work since judiciary inquiry relies on the principle of res ipsa loquitor.
fiks Bodyfiks,"Hayi I dont think he is shaken
Ibutho Khumbane,I never seen him shaken at all
Yoliswa Jebe,"He is not shaken at all if they have anything tangible they must bring it to the commission
Diketso Moyo,Third and last day for PG in the hot seat haven't heard anything I have never heard before
Peter Sant,guys Malema is confused he went to court when PG was fired now he is against pg I m not expecting any Zuma surname to support this zone I comm malema can not be taken serious. @Tharp M only knowledge you have is white @Thato m yes @Thato m why always you attack white people?
Bruce Andrew,EFF have nothing meaningful to say or to contribute to the debate. Most of the comments in the last two days have been mindless
Thato M,"He wouldn't appear shaken obviously "His family has been portrayed as holier than thou "Even his inner circle comrades are shook. His defense has only been the WMC media. they know Julius has dirt on him "When acusations were levelled against some family members no commissions were established but were instead labelled thugs without evidence. Enter Gordhan "So this Commission lead investigator provided pro bono legal services to Adrian Lackay "@Zeno of Elea it was wholly inadequate response one would expect from a Deputy Chief Justice @Zeno of Elea Zondo's response on the matter will draw him unnecessary criticism. Zondo took sides of the lead investigator without allowing the complainant to fully ventilate their concerns "@Zeno of Elea our Constitution requires evidence to be led on both sides of the plaintiff and defendant "@Zeno of Elea which evidence was led @Zeno of Elea what are you saying? An inquiry is a rugby game to you "@Zeno of Elea I also do not follow your logic on the legalities (oaths "This man is pap "@Zeno of Elea thanks for the unsolicited legal treatise. Make your point then "@Zeno of Elea going circles. I was simply pointing out his hypocrisy in dealing with those alleged to have done wrong & how media runs with that narrative "Mpofu will take him to taks @Zeno of Elea no stress. @dave east wow.. This man is on his way out. He will prove to costly for the ANC in the upcoming elections. His daughter Anisha and uncle Ketso Gordhan business dealings will be his albatross. He knows branches and structures of the ANC will be meeting to deal decisively with these matters and calling for the ANC Intergrity commission to investigate while he recuses himself. Days numbered "The pace of his speech is telling. Remember this is the chief witness @Aidan Bain your forefather broke Africa "Anisha Gordhan "@Aidan Bain we move forward in our terms. We inherited a broken system under the guise of a rainbow nation "DCD Group which Anisha Gordhan sits on the board provides services to Kusile @Louis Eloff no why? I see JSE top 40 & all share index & seeing lilly white boards and Exco's @Thando Nkutha 😀 what ar ethey saying? @Knight Wolves United FC what are you on about? @Louis Eloff what about it? @Louis Eloff I can arrange a drone to go there in the next hour or so. "Let it die "@Louis Eloff will lead to a mass exodus "Gordhan is talking about fear when cabinet memebrs @Louis Eloff so what needs to happen then? @Louis Eloff 😀😀😀 you are joking. @Thando Nkutha absolutely The London trip were he was recalled We have the massive coal reserves. Which countries / economies have the highest Co2 emissions? @Kevin Davis same way Anisha Gordhan is owned by Stephen Koseff "Gordhan reallly likes Twitter "@Kevin Davis not until you submit yours. Wait not until Gordhan provides something concrete to the commission "@Kevin Davis what is a tone @Kevin Davis Don''t understand anything you are saying @Peter Sant I don't expect any white person "@Kevin Davis time wasting. I'll tell you fro free @Kevin Davis therefore your argument and rationale falls flat. @Peter Sant were you meant to tag me or nah? @Kevin Davis you are still on emails. Chief. You need professional help. "@Peter Sant ok @Walter Spatula 😀😀😀 evidently "@Kevin Davis no you wouldn't be "@Peter Sant becacuse you are here claiming moral superiority when the banking "@Adrian Fry dirt = Anisha Gordhan That clown Adv Motau is there as well. These jokes write themselves Did Zondo have coffee or a dop of whisky? @Info Eict Vytjie Mentor 😀😀😀 "@Hendrik Botha I am not EFF I want Malema to deal decisively this crook names Joshua Doore @Mahlasela Kilson same way he has been dealing with all other politicla figures. Not rocket science. @Mr Q Passop! @Thando Nkutha true that. Even on the Mining Charter he is dithering @Mahlasela Kilson hayibo. U phuma phi kanti wena @Trevor mokobake power @muwanga soul roy DD Mabusa @Mahlasela Kilson which radio station adn TV news program do you watch / listen to It is these white owned media that messes people's consciousness @Mahlasela Kilson CNN? Did you ever hear Malema talk about ANN7 just an example @Zizoh speak your mind. Don't cower to any man's opinion especially @Mahlasela Kilson then me and you cannot be friends. Goodbye. @Walter Spatula o wa reng na? "That's how I test whether somebody is black or white "I may disagree with a black person on politics (EFF "@Thando Nkutha I do @Thando Nkutha Frantz Fanon: Blacks can't be racist. @Walter Spatula articulate your points properly so we can engage better. @Thishan Naicker you don;t seem to understand racism in context of South Africa and Africa as a whole. You have a bookish approach to understanding racism in the African context. @Thishan Naicker you are the same people who argue BBBEE is racist? Ahem @Thishan Naicker Dar! Now that is a revelation @Thando Nkutha you can't quote a dictionary to the exclusion of lived daily realities of how racism manifests itself @Wilhelm5381 so are you. "I am an African first. All settler minorities come last. In America blacks born there are referred to as African Americans My FIRST love is Africans from Cape to Cairo @anton arjunan how about you tell all listed companies in the JSE who fail to transform their comp 24 yrs in? @Aneila Maharaj 😀😀 @Thando Nkutha its an assumption my brother. But I forgive you @Aneila Maharaj Gordhan's brass band is here for the lullabies. @Aneila Maharaj somebody is touch touchy over political engagements but claims superior logic. Mayibabo! "@Motsamai Shale What do you think about Anisha Gordhan @Ewald Kruger and the rest don't. You guys are amazing "@singhashon she will be an exceptional case "@Ewald Kruger tell me how Anisha Gordhan can score huge gov contracts through CDC @Ewald Kruger Pravin Gordhan & Mcebisi Jonas were the head of National Treasury. "@Ewald Kruger if you are insinuating that the then President would've sight over all SOE deals "@Ewald Kruger hypocritical. We didn't do that for other families. The commissions isn't the be all and end of dealing with the issue. Pravin must be dealt first "@Ewald Kruger this is a political terrain @Ewald Kruger just put your points across man and engage. We will name call when we are done on materiality of arguents *arguments @Ewald Kruger explain the rationale that a political contestation must be taken to the Commission as Gordhan alleges? Please tell me on what basis this should be done "@Ewald Kruger and that is supposed to a logical "Key moment @Thando Nkutha my point exactly. The entire national spend @Ewald Kruger what are you saying? What are you arguing? Say it. Let's engage "@Ewald Kruger don't tag my responses "@Ewald Kruger great How did Gordhan reach the R100bn losses he purported to have caused the country without citing financial flows or atleast one contract? Was it a thumbsuck? @Keryn where's proof of his allegations? We must just take his word for it? Unfortunately Anisha Gordhan is heavily involved and he didn't disclose this. His words are empty rhetoric! "@Ewald Kruger I see you are sidestepping. When all else fails @Wilhelm5381 in your view blacks and Indians were treated the same? Muppet! ANC must boot him out. He is not a man of integrity! Kettle calling the pot black @Walter Spatula for enriching his daughter over millions of people. Afriforum and DA will thank him. "THis is not even a lecture since a lecture is substantiated with facts @Walter Spatula a criminal standing for another criminal. Your logic is amusing! ANC Intergrity Commission must move with speed to deal and look into the allegations of a multi millionaire daughter. "@Walter Spatula political contestations aren't fought in a Commission "Under cross examination He talking politics in a commission. This won't save him. This is politics boss! You did the same to Zuma. Take it from whence it comes "Gordhan forgets he remains a deployee The fact that he is addressing these factional issues here are testament of the balance of forces within the ANC. Branches and provinces won't take this lying down. Especially the aggrieved post Nasrec faction. Chickens will come home to roost "No He did the same to Duduzane & Thuthukile Zuma "Which have state contracts and signed multimillion ran deal while you were a Minsiters "Anisha's rise to Investec Exco is amazing "He is playing pity party Is this in the terms of reference of the commission. Zondo shouldn't be allowing this. This is not a family function. He banna! Zondo object to this trash man!! "It is his reading of the political landscape A family is given leeway to air their personal views. goshhh and we fund this rubbish. Stand up fightters!! EFF got him on Anisha Gordhan. "People are dying in over crowded hospitals "Zondo "It is normal. Now we must all sung the same chorus from the same hymn book @singhashon poems chief!
Nyiko Given Zitha,"Real thugs are committed to their duty
Robert 1,this is boring.
Houws Houlinou,"""How can Pravin be part of the corrupt ANC and not be rotten himself? Why do you say the ANC is corrupt and then say Pravin and Cyril are different? They are the same THIS while Julius was part of the corrupt ANC? He must think we are dumb SABC go and borrow a little bit of money from China and sort yourself out. This live feed is horrible @Zeno of Elea The fact that Zuma and the Guptas got rid of him illustrate to me that he was unwilling to cooperate with them @Zizoh Haw you vote for everyone? @Zizoh When you wear an ANC T-shirt everyone will tell you they will vote ANC. That is human nature We should stop looking at everything in the collective. That is the real problem in South Africa @Thando Nkutha You want to send new thieves with empy pockets to Treasury? @Zizoh Economics 101 is a very interesting read. I suggest you buy yourself a copy @Zizoh So you say no to knowledge. Go figure
Zeno of Elea,The commission is an opportunity for the EFF to put their evidence on record. They should bring it to the deputy chief justice. Too much conjecture about who knows what. The truth will prevail. Bring all/any evidence to the commission. Do you believe that the deputy chief justice is bias? Kangaroo court? So what is our best mechanism to come to the truth? @Thato M did justice Zondo not address this? @Leshope Gerald did Justice Zondo not address this? @Sthakathi Khumalo I think he said he has no smoking gun. Not no evidence. @Thato M How should he have responded? He said he has reviewed what he has been given and ruled accordingly. He said if there is more info he will readdress. @Thato M that is not true. He ruled after getting both sides and said he will reconsider if more evidence is brought forth. @Thato M this is not a court case. It is an inquiry. Findings from this might lead to legal action @Thato M I do not follow - re the ref to rugby @Thato M this is an inquiry. Kind of like a grand jury in the states or other inquiries around the world. The investigate if there are grounds for legal action. "@Thato M If there are grounds to bring charges @Thato M I am trying to understand your position. Are you saying this is not a legitimate process? @Thato M I see. I misunderstood you then. I thought you had a problem with the process. Sorry @dave east what surveys? @Obaid Ally agreed! but my sincere hope is that Zodo can help us get to the truth. @Trucker I guess that is one view.
PETER STAFFEN,they wont they rather stand outside and grandstand he never produce the facts
THABISO MOGORU,since gordan touch sars ...malema know the true that is the reason the fighting the guy that is true pg is fighting PG FIGHT AGAINST THE EVIL OF ZUMA NUCLEAR DEAL ZUMA IS BAD ZUMA WAS WORST THING HAPPENED TO US PG FACTION IN THE ANC WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING PG FIGHT AGAINST NUCLEAR DEAL...….. MALEMA HIS CORRUPT THAT IS TRUE
Mogamat Allie,it is boring because it is using alot of taxpayers money..every body involved should be prosecuted this is a waste of time....TRC .....da wil com
peter pott,then what was wrong with this IMC? PG is really having problems with black leadership really "the presidency  "challenge is that setting up nuclear will take bread of the table of minority coal mine owners "but he was not in cabinet on 9 December 2018 "@nkutha "@em D "secret forces drafting ""memorandum""." "@trucker I am embarrassed by minister pravin gordhan "Yes
Leshope Gerald,This commission is more like a chat room of friends. My screen went black Paraffin Kortaan must come out clean. Is this old white AH the one who helped adrian lackay pro bono The whole ANC is rotten to the core Can anyone inform us why is this commosion being held at Tiso Black star building?
Nelson Musoliwa,Juju is a confused and inexperience politician if Floyd must not be involved with Brian saga why Cr be involved with ANC corruption if not proven. He tjatjarag too much Pravin seem to be avoiding to be cross examined by not implicating anyone but state affairs as they were.He is economical with the truth thus far until proven otherwise Guys is ANC UNITY calls real seen zuma filing affidavits in court to oppose cr decision on moyane You 100% correct Thando Zuma didnt like to follow rules but to instruct what he already agreed with his own gupta circle so anyone who calls for rules will be removed. In essence zuma was incompetence Anyone who will reason that zuma was competent must ask why he paid back about R7m for nkandla saga. He cant even read economic indicators;can understand rating agencies etc Thando think of evidence and testimony he laid bare how rules were flawed in running the government by the administration he served under. The comm is not gunning for one act by one person The ANC failed to prevent state looting because it was divided and senior members were directly involved esp the head zuma with guptas. The aim was no more transformation but personal gain But why do not we hear just one instance where Pravin warned or acted against state capture within ANC stages at all. Why is it not because he was also its role player as well Pravin testimony is not so direct as expected by many; he simply stove to exonerate himself from ANC mudslinging but he shared light on state was incompetently run Failing by pravin to share light on his own flaws or weakness on state capture leads one to think that he is here to build his own personal standing in the society What Pravin is saying now he can submitt to the com later as zondo stated mos He is now crying for sympathetic support now he be reminded that he can do this at some stages not hear
Mthobisi Zuma,kangaroo court indeed why he's on nene issue we already know that he must tell us his own testimony Zondo next target on malema's radar "any one
Johnny James,Nugent Commission is effective period.
mbongeni zondi,someone please speak to ANDILE from BLF to stop this thing intrested
Sthakathi Khumalo,The commission reminds me of Malume Joshua Doors interview with CNN saying he doesn't have evidence but jiki jiki 2018 he knows something!! Lucky Dlamini Sunday times stream is clear hey and lacks stop start sequences "He admitted on CNN Zeno of Elea meaning?? Prescott Smith and what are white people doing??? Continuing with colonizing the continent?? You cant implicate people with smoke guns hebana! "This state capture report dave east IMF must go to sleep we are expropriating land "Frans Phala Intresting point "Thando Nkutha I saw that "Mthobisi Zuma Nxamalala akanabo ubufakazi lomlisa "Thando Nkutha​ Battle of two factions bro Even Baba ka Andile Ramaphosa lols "Who is testifying after Joshua Jamnadas "There are trolls here Pretorius and Jamnadas are confusing Zondo...!! "Molefe was smart "ANC should have sacked Pravin long time ago "I wonder why SANs are anti Nuclear energy "Apart from difficulties in managing nuclear waste and terrorist friendly "Khalid Mather Just think of this in the long run Blackpoison Bp Pretorius and Joshua confusing him!! Gordhan has smurk on his face and its really annoying "Male said "Ae ay ay "So vele vele "em D Then he would contradict himself after that CNN interview where he mentions Zizoh what are you on about? Pravin though is not helping us!! em D I just don't understand why he is not revealing what he has and even bothering to come here and saying he is assisting us!1 I love the way you guys are not entertaining this one called Zizo Eh.... war President who? please say the name sir He must mention name please including him.. chair what could they have done to prevent it "I think where Zondo is going Pravin is to say Thing is Pravin wants to distance himself from the rot of ANC But he too has contributed to State of Capture Is he reading his closing remarks also hebana! "What evidence Please someone take that phone away from him Your daughter must come before the commission suka!! Singh defending his home boy.. Bye sir!! Lucky Dlamini I am just wondering who are the people clapping here?? "em D I doubt Fuzile may have anything really tHIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO SEE BLACK YOUNG FACES "EVERYONE IS CONFUSED
Lucky Dlamini,lack of competition leaves us with this rubbish live feed. PG tries very hard not say anything positive about JZ. He tries to teach Judge Zondo some English too. Just wondering how Solly Mapaila st al plan to defend PG if they are not standing against BLF and EFF publicly. Wouldn't credit Molefe without mentioning Manuel and Ramos? whew! "He told the Judge to connect the ""DOTS"" Lol🐵" I was honestly expecting more from Min PG at this inquiry. Avoiding the CNN's Amanpour question lol! Who are you reffering to??? Three days for this? mayebabo! Lack of useful facts and names. "True "True Why is PG setting himself up? He is using the Commission to answer questions in a wrong platform. Clapping hands?? is it usual?
Aidan Bain,the feed is BAD agreed "amazes me that everybody is coming out now i dont think there is one part that is great @THABISO MOGORU i agree with you one snake two heads "when you look at how the parties act  "they act and speak about the country as if it was ten years ago  i wonder if the KPMG report will ring some truth regarding sars pity we wont see it here it comes why is there still classified information??? ANC broke south africa my forfather and the ANC - But we need to move on and US fix the past PART OF THE STRUGGLE !?? HAHAHAH I See the anc splitting
Wesley M,@Neslon i agree with you. "The ANC does not deserve the countries vote anymore. Our problem is the ANC is broken into pieces. But who do we vote for????
Prescott Smith's Fly Fishing Academy,They are asking him a bunch of easy questions. What a joke. corruption to the core. blacks all over the world are paying attention to what is happening in South Africa and the continent.
Get Up Stand Up South Africa,"The Sun 🌞 does not hide behind the Clouds ⛅️ forever someday it will come out 
Singi Mathebula,The devil you know is better than the devil you do not know. I vote ANC. "IMF is the way to go malema calls pravin a dog. pravin has never spoken bad about malema at least in public. who is fooling who ?
Kabelo Mohlamme,@Prescott Smith who are blacks?
dave east,guys we need to do research before we listen to people guys the IMF has warned against expropriation of land without compensation. the IMF is a white institution that lends money and is against land expropriation in South Africa yes Khalid a group named the free market found ation was founded in 1975 by 6 white men has said expropriation of land without compensation should not go forward another group called AFROBAROMETER founded by 2 white men takes surveys has said South Africans dont want land the land issue is going to fail. african eomen are not voting for the EFF...malema said so WOMEN guys im advising you please do not listen to any of these surveys zeno look at AFROBAROMETER i have made a video about them. they are founded by 2 white men and are going around saying south africans dont want land guys this advocate is close to pravin i just researched it malema is right right thato m right. WE DONT WANT JOBS land first
Khalid Mather,"so there is some truth to the whole Defending the capitalist agenda "exactly @dave east  he from the future "How could it be self funding though  @em D but that would mean we should allow a private company to build a nuclear power station here and sell that power to the state...(grand scheme) "@Thando Nkutha I think we are getting close to a hydrogen energy matrix soon too "@Sthakathi Khumalo in the new stations there is no considerations for even weaponizing the waste "Oil  coconutty lol
Joel Mkunqwana,Gordhan now goes into the heart of Zwane' shenanigans - the man should have long been in orange uniform by now.... "Manufactured facts that have no substance - you are now clinging on straws chief by implicating his family on feeble claims.....shameless
ntlhari manganyi,Countries nearby countries must be ready to help should our approach to land issue fail
Qiniso Brown,the opposition is cracking the ANC soon or later they will be on the president
Knight Wolves United FC,PG admit that he was a sponsor to Guptas circulating TENDAS TO GUPTAS PG admit that he was a sponsor to Guptas circulating TENDAS TO GUPTAS crime #2 circulating Tendas to Guptas of #1 failed to disclose the 66 emails TO Nana "Guptas were influential in Eskom PMG is also involved in this Fraud But despite that THE GUPTAS handled the state well FOR J Zuma other wise this could be the disaster While the Guptas were in state they took some of the money to sponsor they business through PG i.e Trillion and others This conclude everything you need to know about PG that Guptas gave him some allowance and ASSETS But otherwise they have improved South Azania economy during their reign in government state 2010 has bring lot of corruption in STATE Tendas issued fraudly in 2010 We thank the Guptas for thanking over the J Zuma admin(for he was Ghost) but we regret THE FRAUD DONE BY THEM TO THE STATE TO BENEFIT THEMSELVES THROUGH PG We thank the Guptas for tAking over the J Zuma admin(for he was Ghost) but we regret THE FRAUD DONE BY THEM TO THE STATE TO BENEFIT THEMSELVES THROUGH PG May the peace of ALLAH be with you
Obaid Ally,lots of EFF and ANC paid trolls here expected mentality of ANC and EFF supporters. thick as bricks they just so f'ing dumb. why did Zuma supporters conceive children ever?
Mhlanguli Dlodlo,"WOW so there was NO NUCLEAR DEAL Molefe knew something about Nuclear funding. He was clearly targeted. So sad the country missed out on a 9.6 megawatt electricity plant. It would have paid itself out over 20-30 years "If there were no funding models finalised for the nuclear build "@ Khalid Mather the UK is building more nuclear plants with South Korean companies "Folks there is no Intelligence report that is TWO pages This commission is a COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. It is serving it's intended purpose. That's why a whole full grown minister can wave a two page fake Intel Report in front of a judge. Its so shameful Does anyone know of an instance where PG ran for public office or contested an election? Please enlighten us! @Lucky Dlamini please help me to breakdown this testimony. Many fools here who just can't focus lol. Why doesn't he just say it outright that 'YES I HAVE EVIDENCE OF ZUMA being corrupt. @Sthakathi Khumalo aren't his DOTS connecting. I'm starting to think it's bones and not DOTS. I'm so disappointed by PG. "HAYI Pravin "Can PG please name that ""Person"" he mentions was so devastating between 2009 and 2017" "Are there we go @singhashon have you been listening to the testimony of PG??? @singhashon I hope you heard that the nuclear deal never happened! "@ singhashon but you have ideas of who made money in the ""DEAL"" WHERE do you get that from so we can also go read it up?" The Question was what did he and the ANC do when they discovered state capture. ANSWER is Mantashe's Diagnostic Report a few weeks before the ANC elective conference. So this was all politics @ Lufuno Mudau I think he didn't hear the question lol although we heard it lol Can't wait for the cross examination. Hopefully we'll hear more legally useful material and not politics A practical manifestation can simply be named right folks. TELL us who's now attacking the commission? Hey this guy Pravin is re-writing the terms of the commission. This is very sly. He's now testifying for his daughter Is this even allowed. Can one testify for someone else. WHAT! Another person would have been prevented from testifying for someone else. The commission can simple call em up Is judge Zondo now expressing partiality. The PG factor got him hey. Can't wait for Mr Fuzile. Maybe he will be more factual I am the only pragmatic person who was underwhelmed by this conspiratorial testimony? I give up. "@ Ewald Kruger please share the usable evidence he presented. Please don't call me names
Speckled Trim,Anyone been to Pelindaba lately? Pelindaba where the pigeons have 2 heads Nuclear area have u been there lately? lol Why you think Hartbeespoort dam is dying? Nee man you need to send something biological why do people always tag me man sies 😂😂😂 The water is connected underground. once its contaminated a name change wont fix anything South Africa will industrialize further because of joblessness. Factory workers and unions are here to stay. There's a lot of health concerns in that area. just Google it you will see. nuclear damage cant be fixed Declassify and expose the truth to the public. "Haha
Dams daily motivations Madamalala,Hi pravin are you here again malema looted Limpopo Finances through his ill contracts with ANC when he was ANC youth league President till SARS dealt with him now we cnt say malema is Smart
Percy letsoalo,The commission does not have the teeth to bite therefore this process is a waste of state resource and taxpayers money. Let's allow the law enforcement agencies to execute their mandate.
Malusi Zitha,PG is really not giving the deep details as to the events that took place
Trucker Trucker,Molefe should apply to question Pravin and to give testimony. His view on nuclear is interesting. Pravin says Molefe could be right because he was schooled by Manuel & Ramos😂. LOL IS THIS GUY BRINGING INTELLIGENCE REPORTS FROM TWITTER? IS HE SERIOUS? @Kevin Davis ZUMA DOES NOT HAVE TIME FOR GAMES. HE WILL COME WHEN INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED. LOL DID THIS WHITE GUY REALLY CALL THIS EVIDENCE? """The way #PravinGordhan does business with the state through his daughter is deplorable. If he were any of the African leaders Over 8 departments already confirm to have given Pravin’s companies tenders since 2009 when he was Finance Minister. "@Walter Spatula Ja "@Thato M I would rather get news from Twitter than ENCA. Also @Walter Spatula Give me the real sources and stop wasting my time. @Walter Spatula Stop running your mouth and give us the real sources. "@Walter Spatula LOL you're proving to be even more pathetic. When you have nothing to offer to a conversation you turn to metaphors without offering any facts. I repeat 😀🤣😀 IS THIS GUY REALLY PRESENTING GUPTA LEAKS FROM THE MEDIA AS EVIDENCE? DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OR NOT PRAVIN. DON'T TELL US WHAT YOU HAVE A BETTER GRASP OF. PRAVIN HAS ONCE AGAIN ADMITTED THAT HE HAS NO EVIDENCE. HE IS WASTING OUR TIME. @Zizoh EFF IS NOT THE FUTURE! EFF DEFENDED PRAVIN LAST YEAR AND THEY CHANGING THEIR TUNE LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO. FLIP FLOPPERS!! PRAVIN WASTED 3 DAYS ONLY TO TELL THE COMMISSION TO CONNECT THE DOTS!! @Edward Buta ASK PRAVIN. Pravin Gordhan endorses Cyril Ramaphosa yet the current president is the most secretive state man we have ever had. PRAVIN HAS A LOT OF SUGGESTIONS BUT NOTHING SOLID!!

It's not a news source. @Thando Nkutha Horsesh!t. Twitter is the source of much fake news. Ask Trumpstix. @Thando Nkutha Then you will forever be misinformed @Trucker There are no real sources for fake news. That's why it's fake... @Thando Nkutha You mean BFLF? "@Trucker What can I say?

Trevor mokobake,All white people are excused from commenting here.. They need to go form their own commission and discuss how they gonna return the land.
Wilhelm5381,Why doesn't the EFF gotothe commission and make their allegations under oath and with evidence? Answer: because they know they are lying. the WMC narrative is simplistic nonsense and the Indians improved their lot considerably since then... per capita they are the wealthiest people in SA despite apartheid. your mother is a product of WMC... what bull... Vive la difference Notshi...
Huhu Bongani,But to be honest all politicians are corrupt. they are allowed to sell one another to gain some political power. It is important for all of us to have a say to put our country in a right direction.

Pravin Gordan is a criminal... finish en klaar yey... Pravin fired Dudu Mnyeni for telling the truth in the SAA enquiry... she said Pravin has shares at Bidvest and it's a supplier to SAA making billions a month at SAA Pravins Nephew has a business that leases planes to SAA... the Same planes that use to be owned by SAA but sold of... wake up people...

Sam Vanguard,this state capture inquiry is a clear sign that ANC will not be governent 2019 Pravin is a frontman fo the Ramaphosa cabal/faction it's not different from the NKDZ faction/cabal only those disillusioned will think that this fake inquiry will work no one will be implicated and s.a will continue as business as usual pravin should be ashamed to use duplicity to hide his agenda "Pravin is not a hero he is anti-hero Vote ff+ for a prosperous and corrupt free south africa!! this will be the norm if ANC is elected back into power Viva FF+ coalition with D.A EFF and ANC are fighting each other through populism we know where this has happened and we know that it ends with violence It is political error to think that EFF and ANC can deliver to the masses of south africa pravin your words are rotten as like your integrity EFF and ANC fights simply give FF+ and D.A opportunity to effectively fight corruption it's wrong to associate whiteness with riches ANC is in process of transforming itself to become what ZANUpf is today if you vote ANC 2019 you are also an enabler of corruption EFF is trying to hijack the fight against corruption whilst itself it forgets it is a enabler of corruption its pure deception by EFF to label itself as a champion of fighting corruption if you vote for anc or eff go and look at what zimbabwe is then apply it to s.a if anc or eff get in power EFF will not govern S.A next year "vote for FF+  give EFF to govern S.A 2019 it will be like giving Iran and North Korea go ahead to have Nuclear weapons vote FF+ for a safer S.A vote FF+ or DA EFF will turn S.A into another zimbabwe @alain redcliffe IF EFF is voted into power S.A will become Zimbabwe never trust a marxist leninist theoratical garbage carrying thieves Malema uses populist paly books just like Mao EFF is an illusion to turn S.A into another Oligarchical led failing regime EFF uses poor people to buy their votes with expropiation bullcrap @alain redcliffe yaa many especially white south africans will leave but me and my family we will saty and die fighting "Malema said""we don't want war with whites for now""""!!! his sentiments are jsut like the deposed dictator Mugabe"
