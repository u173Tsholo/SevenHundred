Dawed Nodi,is it true that Mugabe has passed "I agree with you cele on Mashaba
Born free,The devil takes care of its own. Do you think that evil tyrant is immortal? Of course it was white man's medicine that kept that nutter Mugabe alive for so long. What are you folk going to do when the Chinese invade?? true that is a fact @Christophal Some people work harder than others. Ramophosa does not sound sincere when he talks. So the black youth of this country steal from law abiding citizens to buy drugs. I will spit on Mugabe's grave Hanekom should make Zuma kiss his feet on a public platform ü§£ The Zanu PF are still in power in Zimbabwe. This is a huge problem because there is no change in the regime. It is up to parents to tell their children not to take drugs. I mean where is the supervision or guidance for these children? True.. Christophel Yes Hillbrow was beautiful before 1994 I am an African Khoisan The police are drug lords themselves ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ I am proudly Rhodesian It is the youth that are the thugs Love the Trump ‚ù§ haha I need new boots Blacks now nothing about commerce and Industry and farming especially Shoprite yip more than 43 million locals It's a pity Mugabe was not struck down by Ebola Yes I am free Grace can offer more than you @david Cele. Grace has university degrees and intelligence. More blacks have died in Taxi's than in any war or disaster I will spit and urinate on Mugabe's grave My dogs can take a dump on Mugabe's grave The British were turncoats white South Africans should do the same.. blacks must pay for infrastructure Right Jacob.. except Nigeria does not border South Africa I am more in favour of black population control than xenophobia. Practise birth control.. please Over population is a problem.. get real Gee Peex These black locals are a dissapointment GEE PeeX they are just as ignorant as you ate The government will run out of money

Those who are there will help to mourn. going where Mr cele we are not going anywhere Mr cele. this is our home now some of us don't sell drugs. we make an honest living and even pay tax to the government. the money that we pay is then used by the government to restore the infrastructure that you guys destroy. David. your head needs to be examined I don't live in an expensive apartment. I live in a shack "Go to western cape to places like mannenberg David. you need Jesus to deliver you from a demon of hatred. Madagascar and Zambia pulled out from the friendly matches that were organised because of the actions by our fellow South African brothers and sisters lack of parenting skills here in SA has destroyed this country. some guys are fathering children and not take responsibility. "David your police is allowing this to happen. they know who sell drugs and they take bribes from the drug dealers. How can you expect the problem to end? I'm proudly Zimbabwean David. it's not all south Africans who go in the voting booth. does that mean they are not south africans south Africa is the only country in southern Africa that does not value life as important. it's so easy to decide to kill another human being. do you know that it will haunt you? you failed ling ago David. there is nothing you can solve now.

Kapn Krunch,it called nyoupe its basically herione and anti retroviral its cheaper then crappy weed thats whats killing our people who arent well off to begin with who sells nyope WE ARE NOT BLIND those nigerians must go there is no excuses what happened to their morals VOETSAK YOU FOREIGNERS WE ARE NOT CONCERNED FOR YOUR OPINION you must go home and fix your countries why are you cowards here but you run from your problems ya you like slaves yes boss no boss 100 rand a day boss those slaves are being sent home and you will have to pay the right amount for work no one believes any different 1 out of 50 doesnt sell druga maybe every legitimate job you do there are people coming out of university who dont have jobs i know Nigerians they use the money of the druggies to send home tp build their house Nigeria is a country that relies solely on illicit revenue how many south african drug dealers to nigerian STOP FOOLING YOURSELFS this country is not a free for all when a nigerian is arrested he is out within hours as they work in cartels we musnt hurt people or loot their property but we must make it clear enough is enough we want charges to stick and people to get depirted i dont understand how you think illegally entering our country IS OKAY look at all the hate but you need our jobs we dont need yours come to south africa legally pay your taxes our tax payers have a heavy burden as it is are you here legally foreign nationals are fine but i bet you if there were legitimate statistics of undocumented immigrants in this country you would fall over its time to fix south africa for the better we will not fix this with violence we will fix it with pressure on our corrupt government if this commision doesnt amount to anything its our responsibility to vote them out as a statement that we wont be taken advantage of any longer if there is less illegals theres more jobs for south africans 150 rand labour is better then nothing i would vote for independence for the cape too if i lived there how can young south africans learn skills if all the entry level jobs are being taken by foreigners because they work for less thats true i live here i can see it for myself and ive seen it for myself the problem is 100 or 150 rand a day companies dont neccesarily have to say who they are hiring as they dont earn enough to pay tax south africa is clearly better then most or we wouldnt have this problem in the first place would we who owns the taxis never forget that when police pull over a Nigerian they take his money and leave because they know locking him up isnt worth the paper work as they will be let out in hours these nigerian cartels are in deep with government mark my words its not britains Britain's responsibility to help anyone we are our own nations now they left us they didnt demand to be payed back like france in nourthern africa they just up and left you know former french colonies in africa are still paying colonial tax for their infrastructure i wish Mugabe's family could have been stripped of their wealth while he was still alive so i could see his face when it happened but ill settle for zumas face
NyandUsaPolitics,So nigerians are basically the mexicans of africa? "Its not like you can't make drugs inside south africa. Itts a big place look at the map. You think all the drugs coming from another place At least yoru blaming nigerians not afrikanners the food-makers. thats at least social progress to start "i think SA has alot of crazy people who get whipped up into a horde and a frenzy and destroy stuff and attack people and rob. Thats the problem "Just copy england and AMerica what they do right if you want to get rich as a country. Copy whats they do right "Make friends with DONALD TRUMP. NOT OBAMA if you want South Africa to do well. Make money not create conflict

Grace Titus-Glover,South Africans should know that your people are also in other African countries and they are surely going to retaliate. It is a shame to be attacking other foreign nationals. If you dont want them in your country let them leave peace fully. This is total ignorance and foolish. Learn some skills and work dont be lazy. Foreign nationals if SA people think they dont need you in their countries just leave and join your families and we will stop patronizing their products. Am happy ACCA is not going to have the conference in SA this year. Other African countries will stop patronizing your products and you will see how you will survive Dont kill them let them leave peacefully Loot shops and they will do the same to South Africans in other countries Foreign nationals leave their country for them and stop patronizing their products SA people go educate your selves and work Phumelela you want to know where am from I am well educated woman from Ghana and working hard to take care of my family Ghana. I will never come and waste my time in S.A. Guys we have so many foreign nationals in Ghana doing business and we treat them well. We ensure that they do the right thing by complying with all the rules in running their business. Remember when you attack a foreign national in SA they will do the same to your people in other countries. Nkosi you are saying 10 people dead is only. Wow. Talk to your government to help you. At least learn some skills. There are so many skills you can learn on you tube. Try to do some thing for your self please. Phumelala . I wont tell you because you guys are attacking our people in you country Krunch that is not true David cele then your people should also leave. Time to work see yaa. Stop attacking people. David Cele am in Ghana. Sweet country. As i said am a Chartered Accountant ACCA precisely . And again i am in Ghana. David Cele what will i be doing in South Africa. Am sorry South Africa is not heaven for Christ Sake David Cele I told you that because of this unfortunate action from you guvs ACCA UK will cancel their conference which was suppose to take place in SA. Think about the money you guys are going to loose because of this. Seriously you guys need Jesus. hmmmmmm hmmmm Those who have been killed by this heartless people should rest in peace The rest of you should come home please especially Ghanaians . Your family have missed you. South Africans are never going to stop Xenophonic attacks. So please leave their country. And let all see how they will survive without the help of other countries Balls what ever you call your self am not living in South Africa and i will never live there. Please I would rather live and work in my country than living in S.A. and would be killed like a fowl one day. "Remember you have your companies all over Africa countries.
