carnoth ngomane,@Yandi Masina i think Mcbide's testimony did not reach people's expectations hence they voted with their absence today "@Michael Wild i agree with you "@Afika Centane The Polokwne Conference was the down fall of the ANC @Thando Nkutha lol @Robert Russell why blame PW? @Thando Nkutha I get you bro "@makhosi nobhatyi DA is using the ANC as t election campaign cos they have nothing in store for the country @makhosi nobhatyi they know they wont win hence they play the man not the ball "@Derek Main i know who to vote for and why @Derek Main then you are just wasting your time sir cos i know where i stand and i dont get moved any force whatsoever @Ndim Mavuks you are correct @Derek Main keep dreaming @Derek Main the sand feels cooler than your advice "@Ndim Mavuks i dont agree "@Derek Main thats your problem @Ndim Mavuks dealing with corrupt individual doesnt have to follow rather it must be done now than later @Derek Main you are like a doctor who give diagnosis but cant advice on medication hence i dont take you serious.
funicanz,Morning
Phindile Motaka,Morning
Derek Main,Morning @Nelson Musoliwa That's because we allow our leaders to get away with it. @Nelson Musoliwa Yes - it should be a law that all government ministers must use public facilities. "@Nelson Musoliwa Theri kids must go to government schools @Robert Russell Unfortunately the Geneva convention is no longer worth the paper it is written on. The US regularly flouts it with their actions around the world. "@makhosi nobhatyi If they all faced the consequences for their actions @PATRICK MANALA That is true and they are nothing but fools. @makhosi nobhatyi @Ndim Mavuks You must be fools to vote for a party that has proven to be so corrupt. You are voting for more of the same. @Ndim Mavuks I know you can't be convinced. I'm just telling you you're a fool if you can't see the ANC is corrupt to the core. "@Ndim Mavuks Have you not been listening to anything at this commission?? You need to take your blinkers off. It seems the problem is not the ANC @Ndim Mavuks The point is that the ANC is corrupt to the core and their members can't seem to see it. @Robert Russell Hence why I say the ANC is corrupt to the core. "@Ndim Mavuks I don't need someone to explicitly say ""The ANC is corrupt"". It can be deduced from the evidence so far." @Ndim Mavuks Can you honestly say that none of the evidence here has pointed any fingers at ANC members? @Cerebis Yes exactly - look at the bunch of criminals they have put forward for us to vote for. @Ndim Mavuks I understand your historic connections to the ANC but that organisation is dead a long time ago. The ANC of today is an entirely different animal. Time for you to find a new hero. @Cerebis One thing you can be sure of with Ace is that he is plotting something. He's a gangster. @Cerebis Ace is busy setting up a parallel government. @Ndim Mavuks @Rusty SpyGoat As I said Ndim (and I know you have some difficulty comprehending) - it doesn't have to be stated explicitly - it is possible to hear evidence given and form an opinion. @makhosi nobhatyi What both the DA and the ANC are doing in Alex is shameful. Just finger-pointing with no accountability while the people suffer. "@makhosi nobhatyi If you are trying to imply that the ANC is not using the Alex situation for politicking @Mandla cyril Mankoe I'll bet you believe in the tooth fairy too. @Cerebis I agree - politicians being politicians. Shameful! @carnoth ngomane So vote for any other party execpt the DA or ANC then. It's not rocket science. @makhosi nobhatyi I put it to you that the ANC is not capable of fixing problems they created in the first place. You're only fooling yourself. @Mandla cyril Mankoe True - the only problem is the ANC bag would be empty. @Brian Mercado That's right - we have just changed one set of corrupt politicians with another. "@carnoth ngomane You're going to get my advice anyway. Use it "@Ndim Mavuks You're using the ANC stratgey of ""If you tell a lie often enough @carnoth ngomane That's fine by me - I'm not going to stop saying it. You will wake up eventually. "@makhosi nobhatyi Absolutely @carnoth ngomane And you keep your head stuck firmly in the sand. @makhosi nobhatyi Why don't you tell us a bit about how the ANC cadres stole the money that was meant to be used for improvements in Alex? @Themba J Thobela A conservative estimate. @carnoth ngomane Coming from someone who thinks the ANC is cool - that's no surprise. @Ndim Mavuks Expecting the ANC to sort out corruption is like expecting the Ku Klux Klan to sort out racial prejudice. @carnoth ngomane There are plenty of alternatives. It's just that the fool ANC supporters can't see the immense harm the ANC is doing to SA. @Themba J Thobela And the common denominator in all the looting is the ANC. @carnoth ngomane Dude! You're hurting my feelings! ü§£
nyiko nyiko,corruption is bad 4 our country
Blaze 613,Is Rob giving names or just stories? I only have 3 beers left in fridge...Ace where are you??
Magda Seguin,It's not stories...The then police minister nhleko is being proven to have acted illegally according to the Constitutional Court judgement Nhleko interferes with the independence of IPID Mugabe was rushed to Singapore for medical treatment.Just goes to show how he destroyed his country that he has no faith in his own health system.Its an African problem.Mabuza was treated in Russia Even the Nigerian president was treated in the UK for months...disgraceful Is that true? So apparently ear infections can't be treated in Nigeria...how crazy Politicians lie constantly and gullible people believe and vote for them time after time @Afrika that is not true.. Do you know of other heads of states or politicians coming to Africa for medical treatment? We have brilliant medical professionals but they are forced to leave yhe coubtry due to bad government policies I rest my case...its your choice to believe what you believe...btw I am not illiterate or dumb "There are hundreds if unemployed doctors that completed their community service Tr√®s been merci Monsieur Russell St vous? *Et Chouette! tout va bien alors Tes the two emails that Werksmans produced this morning was debunked by McBride's testimony The Constitional court judgements proved IPID's independence and that the Minister of Police at the time interfered @Robert Russell I feel that way about de Klerk knowing his regime killed thousands @Lew464 try to learn about apartheid history..it's a shame that apartheid worked so well that we don't know about each other's pain and suffering. So how many innocent civilians do you think died during 40 years of apartheid? When the casspirs entered the townships nobody was safe Security forces? against the majority of a population to uphold a racist regime? As long as part of South Africans are in denial about apartheid we will never be able to reconcile In the 80's if you didn't get home drenched in teargas and given 5 minutes to disperse with helicopters hovering above you will never know what we went through @Jack...I don't consider that number as remotely accurate I don't know @Robert just judge g from the comments here makes me think that it is a microcosm of denialism @Lew464 I am not going to engage on semantics with you This is the apartheid denialism and apologetic approach that Holocoast denialists also come up with. I don't pander to apartheid denialism Making excuses for a crime against humanity makes you complicit A sane and logical person should condemn ALL violence...not in isolation when it suits their agenda I NEVER said it's ok to kill civilians..I just find it strange that people who mentions McBride' s actions must look in the mi...those who supported apartheid Just say outright that you maybe hoped Mc Bride was hanged...he was on death row like so many others. @makhosi don't change the subject...this is a specific discourse...we are all against the looting of the ANC and corporates. My last words on this...somebody said over the weekend that the Apartheid regime and the past 24 years plus is exactly the same thing.We are still being oppressed...just a different oppressor. And I agree "@Rust true...look how the Sudanese deposed Bashir after a 30 year dictatorship @makhosi and Ace has the gall to do door to door with a straight face @Rusty Correct @Rusty it is correct in part as the Apartheid government was brought to it's knees by both the struggle and external pressure due to the international work done by Oliver Tambo and his team outside SA "South Africa is the most diverse country in the world there is no comparison with USA Most of the countries mentioned diversity is due to immigration It is thus more difficult to achieve unity and equality In SA The US diversity is very recent history Apart from the US colonizers that mostly came from Italy and Ireland Yes South Africa is the most diverse...medical researchers call it the 'natural laborotary' due to the genetic pool Time out Best just to follow the proceedings...too tiring on this forum
Madelein R,I am still waiting for petrol money üòÄüòÄüòÄ
Mthobisi Dlalisa,Spider Lol
jeevan singh,Michael as deep as ethnic lines. "if all South Africans come together as one people Magda very true. we have divisions amongst all of our people. And that is going to destroy us. Nothing else. Africa. The past stopped in 1994. 25 years later we are more divided as a people than we were before. more poor. more unemployed. more uneducated more corrupt. more and more and more. Magda true We need a new government. that Ace Magushle. hey that gangster guy. don't trust that man. wants to topple Cyril Ramaphosa. hey man. I'm scared for South Africa.
Ifeanyi Anyaoha,Nigerian President was treated in UK hospital just for ear infection
Nelson Musoliwa,Policing the police is a daunting task and dangerous one if parliamentary committee watch dog is not objective as ours was. Someone said Africa is a grave yard because when its leaders fall ill thay are treated in Europe or else where but when they die they are buried in Africa @Derek imagine if we all got lot of money to be treated outside our country for any illness it would render our own health system useless. @ Derek i agree with you because they can not give their all to the improvement of facilities that they do not utilize. It is daylight robbery. @Magda you are raised a crucial point in struggle point of view really. Undesirable that the oppressed could not consolidate their sufferings on a common ground @Brian as much as the struggle was prescribed to be fought with due diligent there was no doubt that civilians will at time be caught in cross fire so ja he unwittingly got involved I think Macbride didn't loose track of what we struggled for hene he did his best to continue fighting wrong things which even endangers his own life
Felix Muyoba,"@Nelson Musoliwa you have a point there I cant understand what is so special about europe..
Wildthing,SA needs law and order back. and people doing wrong should be placed in jail. otherwise we will not go anywhere but backwards and criminals will rule.
Robert Russell,Bonjour madame comment allez vous Oui Anything new happened yet today? Whilst I'm happy that he has come forward to the commission I still have a issue looking at him... knowing he killed innocent people.... especially young adults who had their lives ended by him. And that makes it OK ????? I think PW was more to blame then De Klerk I am not condoning the actions of the security forces etc. but taking the lives of innocent civilians is not cool.if MK was a ligit military outfit they would have complied with the Geneva convention I agree with you... I don't condone it from any side on the debate.... but some people think it's ok because they are white... and that's why we we will never move on as country... Yeah but I'm talking about in the early 70's @Derek Main who has denied apartheid existed or the atrocities that it gave the majority of the country??? @Magda Seguin @Dilip Badal ... I think he did not use common sense killing innocent young people.... how does and action like that make any kind of sense ???? *any action And killing innocent civilians makes it ok to take the law into your hands????? @Ndim Mavuks absolutely not... there was no sense at all in all the killings.... we could have way down the road by now of having a integrated country if the senseless killings were avoided and I see that children are being used again in service delivery protests in Enerdale today.... what do you expect to happen... someone is going to get hurt or killed.... How about this... R29m for a guards hut and ANOTHER R29m for gates and a dog kennel at one of our ministers houses.... this could build at least 580 RDP houses.... that ANC government for you. Exactly the truth of the matter.... the ANC are a collective... and so are their voters... both morally corrupt.... @Derek Main @Derek Main ... releax you speaking to ANC Vota...<80.... what you expect??? "and your ""glorious liberation movement"" keeps crooks and thieves in parliament... nice one @Ndim Mavuks" @Derek Main not according to @Ndim Mavuks all in the ANC are heroes... LOL!!!! So who was held accountable and was prosecuted for teh death of 143 Life Esimeni tradgety.... NO ONE... they are ANC members.... how does that work???? FFS.... Ndim.... move on we are in a new democratic dispensation or as you missing the apartheid era way of doing things "You have a ""On Point"" there @Brian Mercado" @makhosi nobhatyi .... I think it's more like who gets there first loots first with ANC.... nothing to steal.... then move onto another municipality... How can the ANC not be corrupt when they kept Zuma in power knowing what they did....@Ndim Mavuks South Africa has a serious problem if the ANC gets a 2/3 majority.... first thing will be a credit down grade for sure. The common voters should have shown their disapproval but didn't .... @Cerebis

Jack Sparrow,"@Magda Seguin estimates are about 10000 deaths @Magda Seguin yet it's quite well documented @Ndim Mavuks is missing the point @koena jonas All thanks to the PP and her findings on state capture @Ndim Mavuks decisive ANC victories for 25 years haven't even dented unemployment
Pheladi Lamola,I love DCJ Zondo's mind.
Dilip Badal,Mr Mc Bride uses the term .. common sense should prevail... did he use his commom sense in regards to the Magoos bar bombing ?? i think not.. just glad he has been terminated from his duties "@Magda Seguin ..Lew464 asks a valid question... you should reply accordingly "@Robert Russell ..absolutely correct
Ndim Mavuks,"Dilip pls read the TRC transcript "Was there any common sense as far as the whole racist apartheid system is concerned including the actions of Wouter Basson "We buried 10 The Magoo's Bar incident was a legitimate military target as it was frequented by the apartheid army officers unlike the earlier Sharpeville massacre. McBride remains a hero of the liberation struggle "Then white arrogance declared ""no one is to blame"" for the senseless people of more than 60 people" Makhosi you are correct that is why we will give the ANC a 2/3 majority Rusty I align myself more with the political that led to economic and international pressure and Derek it is too late to try and convince us with insults with just a few days to go before elections "Repeating the lies that the ANC is corrupt does not turn into the truth. I am sure all the corruption happening in the private and public sector equals to ""the ANC is corrupt"" Then what is the point? "Tell me of one testimony in this commission that explicitly said ""The ANC is corrupt"" with facts and evidence" Pls Rusty tell that to Derek Robert who was held responsible for the Sharpville Massacre no one Mashaba learnt the tendencies of white arrogance so prevalent today Now we talking Mindlos "Thanks Rusty """SA belongs to all who live in it"" Freedom Charter adopted by the ANC" "SA is home to all Including racists farmers who abuse the people "We wish all opposition parties well as they fight for opposition seats "The ANC is not corrupt "No I am repeating what you said Derek: ""corrupt politicians"" remember" After the 2/3 majority victory after the May 8 elections The only hope for the country in terms of fighting corruption and reduce racialised unemployment and inequality is a decisive ANC victory as confirmed as confirmed by the ratings agencies The ANC has over the years made a lot of progress and the majority knows it and yes ngomane dealing with the corrupt elements will surely follow "Ngomane
Thami Ngwenya,How does killing 22 year old brutaly through the gallows make sense
makhosi nobhatyi,"Those who did wrong must face consequences of their action "Before we can criticize past "These commission will help us to know what went wrong? And also give us a chance to fix it "Magda Seguin I am not changing anything I don‚Äôt defend corruption "@Magda Seguin I agreed with what you have heard "Anc is in a process to correct this problem "DA failed to go to listen to the people of Alex  "If Mashaba just went there without points fingering "DA opened a space for ANC do their job "We demand service delivery as we did even to the ANC  "@cerebis üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ you will learn every opportunity DA open ANC will respond "Carnoth ngomane exactly all these parties their focus is ANC even when they deliver their manifesto you will hear Anc "@ cerebis we all need what is best for South Africa no one should politicized people problem "@ cerebis we are not looking even ANC not to respond to the problem of the community as Gwede Mantashe says "We don‚Äôt need people who will feel nice when she or he sees media "There many protesters across the country where the ANC lead or DA lead "@Derek main you need to understand we are not talking about who created "@Derek main people was complaining about simple things "@Derek main hawks must come up with investigation look where is money and those who did wrong be charged
PATRICK MANALA,some people will be shocked by state capture and will vote anc come may
Rusty SpyGoat,"If we lived in any other country or society "Praising the ""liberation struggle"" is more anecdotal than what actually led to the end of apartheid. What really stopped apartheid was international economic and political pressure." It's the same as praising the 'Jewish struggle' for the defeat of the Nazi's. When in actual fact it was the allied forces that defeated the Nazi's.. "The question is; Is the ""rainbow nation"" possible to achieve? Can we live in a multicultural society "If we can not live in a true 'multicultural society' then we should create seperate states "Lew464 but how do we achieve equal opportunity? It seems to be so far away. Not only in SA but look at USA "Magda Seguin SA is not the most diverse country in the world. It is very diverse no doubt Ndim Mavuks Tell me one testimony in this commission that explicitly said anyone is corrupt? This is an enquiry. This is not a criminal prosecution. "Derek Main I get that "Im not diminishing the tragedy of the Sharpville Massacre. It was horrible "I am a descendant from a Danube Schwabe. Germans that were genocided in communist Yugoslavia after WW2 Ndim Mavuks Nothing in my statement insinuated 'move on'. At least I acknowledge the suffering caused to black South Africans. You however lack empathy to sympathize my greater loss.
Antonie Goosen,"@ Ndim Mavuks ""Military"" Seriously ?? They were terrorists and committed terrorist acts! Nothing military about it" The struggle continues! Struggle to steal. loot and keep the sheep voting for the cANCer @ Cerebis - Any ANC as President will NEVER be for ALL the people of SA - the anc will never allow that
