Mzalwane Mzala,@x. .x Are you saying black people are not smart? @Melvict Melbourne I am sure I am much smarter than you racist @x. .x It has nothing to do with smartness of black people.
Melvict Melbourne,@Mzalwane Mzala very clever when it come to stealing and schemes This commission is a waste of time. Nothing will come of it. @Mzalwane Mzala stating facts is not racist Why is their paperwork up the tree? Short walk to state failure. Morning The fun part is that the masses still voted for this same party that is stealing from them. What I battle to understand is that politicians have supporters Counting is millions preparing for war...when the first lead start flying the cadres pee in their overalls. She is pathetic she is unprepared "@Mbuso Ndlovu that is crap Stolen When will the masses ask for forgiveness? If she was white shoe would have just been a normal person. She is old enough to have passed with real marks....see the difference

Yongama Mdleleni,yes we are waking up @ nilsen @ Nilsen and it seems nothing is about to change Highlight of this inquiry was when Maleka had Jimmy against the ropes @nobhatyi I hope that is true
A A,this lady 😑 when is this advocate finishing? i cant watch this she sounds like a paralegal
roberto wilco,Liz your right money will run out and there will be no more cash to steal Danie Fact

makhosi nobhatyi,Ace Magashule will be asked by Maleka Zondo is angry now "Judge was too harsh Zwane and Ace Magashule cheated the bread of poor So we are still supporting these thugs who eat money and did nothing All these ID was in the Guptas house 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️
larona Tsikwe,what jst happened?
Kevin Simon,That didn't go too well... So they got advice that the agreement was invalid. Still said they would go ahead. Lorraine Naidoo ​week....you mean weak? Danie Nilsen ​he has daiarea and ran to a pit toilet. Pray explain please Surely he would have been a main witness in the PP's investigation. I would be surprised if he was. I'm sure its coming. Zondo is very thorough. Unlike some of our elected public representatives. He is trying to make sure that no evidence can be disputed on a technical oversight. An example to all.
Karen x,No he was appointed by the Chief Justice
Sophia Maholela,Investigating team is dissapointing this lady still has a long way to go "he adjourned becoz he got irritated with the files
Ibo Thabo,"The Adjournment was abruptly and CJ asked someone to sort-out the documents
ThandaM,@Karen x No he was nominated by the Chief Justice but appointed by Zuma
david jacobs,Morning all another day of suprises @Liza Komape Indeed he sits behind this Ace Mangi Magashule it can only be on Ace's instruction that funds to this day still flow to this farm (Its not a dairy farm) its a farm to launder money its sad that these politicians think nothing of the poor yes its a lot of money but how many people were destroyed by those in power @kagiso mathole Speak truth sister
Liza Komape,"I agree with All that say advocate Maleka must come back just for ace
Kresien //M,Our leaders must listen to Sadhguru and attend inner engineering
JERRY GOODE,What’s going on? Where is Zuma? Who is this dude so by the way? He looks like the silver fox 🦊 "Nando’s should make Zuma burger

Think we myst get Zondo to recuse himself. Then we start all over again...all the gov empoloyees us watchin inquiry no work is getting done...lol "Going nowhere slowly....eish
mafuta,"can't be
Eugene,So who's fault is it? why did it take Zuma a year to say his not guilty? it took Zuma a year to get rid of the evidence they should all have heart monitors and other equipment to see if they are lying

"Jhb is busy @Abel Matshidiso Zondo is a real lawyer....looking for little or tiny loopholes as always I only like the previous translator...with that radio voice "That man translator was impressive and didn't care much- He'd be like: "" Hohohoho sorry chair......
