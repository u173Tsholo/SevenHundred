makhosi nobhatyi,Welcome back "We need each other in order to move South Africa forward
Magda Seguin,Welcome back too 🤣🤣 @Nomonde you're are so right! Gold is the new world currency I understood exactly about how he explained about the reports....but Mr Pretorious does not...bathung 8 minutes....report explanatio not yet resolved Eslon is it not the lighting in the room? Eslon give her a break😂 I will really miss you all when the commission ends Making a 'genuine errors TWICE...Haribo Judge *haibo They are really giving Mc Bride a hard time...what exactly is at play here? It's the first time a witness is so minutely questioned Thanks all...there may be serious stuff coming..I read in Amaghubane that there is a story of the alleged illegal surveillance by State Security of the Nasrec ANC conference which was thwarted Imagined versions? Really? The Judge is digging deep McBride is unphased Eslon Family and friends liaisons run deep in state capture Maybe the Judge should have refused himself but he insisted to be part of this testimony Most of this sounds like cross examination not leading evidence Do you know the difference? it's not about liking but facts I understand that but why do they change tactic with this witness and only did it a few times in between the testimony of others My thinking is they are walking on eggshells here as so many state security people were involved I reported Geldenhuys...harassment and bullying...this is not a platform to spew put hatred True @James No his brother chaired McBride's disciplinary He is steadfast @frederick we need to be patient Exactly @Eslon Eish @Eslon if it is it is pure evil Sunday Times is a discredited rag Mzilikazi Wa Afrika was outed and the Sunday Times had their award rescinded due to the Booysen affair Remember it is Surve's publication Yes also the so called SARS rogue unit I used to buy it religiously until I read an article in Noseweek of what really went down It is Shivambu who again reported Pravin to the PP...The EFF are stirrers The apartheid racists are all over this thread I know @Cerebis I blocked most of them There are credible honest journalists but due to Surve all are regarded as having an agenda They remind me of the embedded journalists during the Iraq war who fed the world with US propoganda Sorry I am not from government never was @Papzen complain to your local ANC offices please "Paris It's 11C here today No I'm a dual national but my heart is in SA Yes I'm with family I intend going back soon Thanks😊 We are resilient and committed @Tseliso we will overcome I stayed in Bloemfontein on my work travels a few times...Bethlehem and Bloemfontein So quick! Have a super weekend guys 9:30 for 10:00...lol 😊
Amanda Watson,"I'm enjoying this book reading. Put it on while you're working and listen to all the people "@Sthakathi Khumalo Ya bru
nyiko nyiko,000
Seshupo Mangwejane,what?
Sthakathi Khumalo,Amanda Watson Are you related to the Gavin Watson family? "Desmond Masilela Felix Muyoba- Ae gents "Brown paper bags "The same culprits Jiba Amanda Watson can you send eWallet please.. Stay safe and behave people!!
Desmond Masilela,@Sthakathi Khumalo. 😂😂😂😂 @Sthakathi Khumalo. 😂😂😂 I can see that. Hope you win bra @Sthakathi Khumalo. You may get some black bags as well. @Felix Muyoba. that is what im refferring to. 😂😂😂 @Madelein Huxtable. You have chosen Bitcoin i would go for GBP I'm not sure if is the camera or the adv lady next to Mr Pretorius. Here face is totally different than her neck. But let me sit down and eat my humble pie. @Eslon Eslon. 🤦🤦🤦 I was expecting some big bombs by this time. Nothing as yet. Who are the 30 officially top ANC members that media has spoken about? @Madelein Huxtable. I'm just confuse really. Mr Mcbride is here just to nail his former employer. @Eslon Eslon. We were told his going to dish some bombs and nothing till now. @Eslon Eslon. But I understand why he has pull any plug yet. Is because of the Adv when he always say will talk about that in due course. @Jane .Blamire. Mr Mcbride will be here for 2 days according to the chair. His now on a second day maybe he might finish next Monday. So at this time not Bomb shell has been pulled. @Khaya Nomoyi. Eishhh..... you right @Madelein Huxtable @Khaya Nomoyi. This team of Mr Pretorius is boring. I think I will only watch the team of Adv Maleka. This one is just wasting my data. @Khaya Nomoyi. Remember the other team is investigating Bosasa the other Guptas. So The Adv Maleka team is investigating Gupta I think some other issues as well. @Khaya Nomoyi. Thank you. I feel like i can vomit when I see Fils name here @Anne M.. And ppl keep on entertaining him @peter pott. That is what irrittates me with this media. Expecially Sunday times. When you in trouble they put you front page with big face on it. Once you clear you name they put you in the middle of the page @peter pott. so for us not to know that you have cleared your name. Can someone ask the chair to drink water please. @Felix Muyoba. Is he coughing as well? I see the jug of water is almost finished @Felix Muyoba. I thought it was the chair. Since well you know his breath is also not up to standard. @Felix Muyoba 😂😂 @Felix Muyoba. Imagine he shout at you with his voice. @Felix Muyoba. 😂😂😂😂 Have a great one all guys enjoy the weekend until we chart Monday.
Felix Muyoba,@Sthakathi Khumalo straight to the point! @Sthakathi Khumalo haha..you will scare her @Sthakathi Khumalo she should declare herself @Sthakathi Khumalo and security money bags @Desmond Masilela am with you @Desmond Masilela i think @Sthakathi Khumalo has scared one of the watson family @Sthakathi Khumalo 😂 please stop @Madelein Huxtable no in hard cash please..i dont trust bitcoin..bitcoin will be crushing the markets soon @Derek Main you are right @what? i wont or they were players and refrees at the same time.. @Fils de l'homme wena transvaal province is history @Madelein Huxtable he should go and live on another planet @Madelein Huxtable awb of the late terelanche (may his soul rest in peace)? @Madelein Huxtable that one was a hard line boere..very uncompromising fello..i respected his conviction @Desmond Masilela or not at all because you are of no consequence anymore (by clearing your name).. he (mcbride) should drink water @Desmond Masilela yes it is him coughing..is that not so? @Desmond Masilela 😂😂 @Desmond Masilela the zondo voice is a serious gruff one.. @Desmond Masilela hey hey..
Nomonde Dr Nolutshungu,Skeletons in the cupboard
Wildthing,"lots of this could have been cleared up with a life style audit. you live in a house worth X but you earn Y please explain. added cars
Madelein R,I want mine in Bitcoin The people in our building works with Bitcoin. They say that it will go up and peak in June. Please do not see this as financial advise @Derek Main - dont have money to buy it anyways Eslon - it might be the light that makes it look bad @Derek Main - thank you @Desmond Masilela - I also thought so. But may be they are buying time for the notifications (2 day Notice when naming someone) I also want a Louie Vuitton bag. 50K will be fine for now 😀😀😀 "@Fils de l'homme - If you tos around on this forum @Fils de l'homme - it is not freedom of speech. TRANSVAAL belongs pre-94. Move on buddy @Khaya Nomoyi and @Desmond Masilela - agree "Thank you @Felix Muyoba - I told the dude @Felix Muyoba - I think Fils belongs to the AWB 😀😀😀 Yip

Brandaan Huigen,Lol really going into detail here
Eslon Eslon,Goodness!! the makeup on the young advocate lady next to Pretorius is pathetic "Magda Seguin "@Desmond Masilela "Give him time Jane. Blamire... Remember this guy will disturb Zondo's conscious bcoz he will implicate his younger brother Zondo will want to use every opportunity to confuse Mcbride for his younger brother's sake "@Michael Michael "@Magda Seguin "@Magda Seguin It seems Mcbride was a thorn in the flesh of the looters Current PP is busy chasing after Pravin over the so called Sars rogue unit Sunday times are bunch of embedded Journalists Dairy maverick told us that Floyd Shivambu received money from VBS but haven't given us any proof until today Eish! a private law firm investigating a government agency while the NPA haven't move an inch
lucky Molepo,we dont care abt make uo
Derek Main,@Madelein Huxtable They have a vested interest in saying that if they own bitcoins. They want more people to invest in them so the value will go up. Feels like a pyramid scheme. "@Madelein Huxtable In that case
what?,"buy bitcoin each to their own 😃
The Vuka Experience,Is he dropping bombs or ?
Ariel Heaven,"Where can one find a Louie Vuitton handbag that was a left over
GH MG,bla bla bla bla bla
Antonie Goosen,also can't see the relevance or how any reliance could be placed on the testimony of a drunk and a murderer @ Nelson Musoliwa -McBride may take it literally and kill more innocent people
AYE!! its yaddy,viva anc viva
Blue moon Spring,I am asking that same question Magda😉
Jane .Blamire,Magda. Maybe something big coming?? Being thorough for a reason?? Agree Desmond.....name dropping to come soon Huh? "Quote...He [McBride] will testify to a range of matters and a range of disciplinary hearings
Nelson Musoliwa,Some imagined versions detonating bombs that sparks with wine in the bottle nooo guys version bombs ere not necessarily explosive or dramatic @Eslon u raise a very important issue involving conflict of interest on Zondo's part but he is regarded in high esteem the legal team shows competitiveness so fr
Luzuko Ngetu,what a big voice zuma is the legend
Talent P Sibisi,Zuma again for Gaddaffi money he he he
Aniceth De Missamou,"@TalentSibisi
Michael Michael,Elson mr Zondo is a fair person Corbis he is more than that.the gd thing is not to entertain him. Solly they were given until tuesdy to have an input.on the findings of the report by the President. Yolo just ignore him not from state Me too.mr make a Magda from France.u migrate or wt? ok Magda not a problem u are welcome

Cerebis,@Fils de l'homme You are a race baiter and a stupid person. Wow.... @Fils de l'homme It must be your turn to use the family brain cell today? Use it wisely dude! Blocked Fils "@Magda Seguin Yes
James Godloza Godloza,I like the way SC Pretorius is leading/cross examining the witness "look at it this way my sister just thinking or drawing my own opinion but as I'm not a law expert but only trying to understand the working of the law I think with the fact that when they started with this witness the was this cloud of conflict as the DCJ brother being implicated @Jane I think the DCJ has proven beyond doubt that he is the man for this job but i still believe the submissions made by the panel will be applicable at the end @Anne that is correct
Mziwandile Ndlovu,molo
Dominic Przybylski,For a moment I saw the garbage from fils de l'homme and then I realised I wasn't logged in. Now he has disappeared. Best block I ever did.
Khaya Nomoyi,This is becoming so boring now. Masilela you are right.What is the problem with differentiating these reports and move on? "OK
Anne M.,"@Desmond Masilela I am not sure the DCJ's brother is implicated as such. From what I understand (yesterday morning) @Magda Seguin It is sad to see what the Sunday Times has become. I think Fils is a paid troll to try and distract us from the commission.
frederick Mashavhela,guys wait for Mr Mcbride he is a credible man he will soon drop those bombs exactly Mr pretorius will soon find a way with Mr Mcbride
Quintin Jacobs,still no smoking gun ie JZ is corrupt?? cde McBride using StateCapCom to settle scores well done to him Sunday Times is part of State Capture VOTE for the FREEDOM of WES KAAP Sunday Times / News24 / ENCA are part of State Capture
