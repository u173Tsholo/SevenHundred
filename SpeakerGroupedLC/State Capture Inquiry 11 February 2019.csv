Eslon Eslon,Vytjie Mentor messed up. At one point she retract some her statements. that alone makes her not a reliable witness Mrs Mentor is not a reliable witness "@Peter Pott "@Bheki There was an SIU in the public domain indicating that Bosasa was involved in corruption. Wasn't that enough for Thuli to investigate? How did she miss the Bosasa scandal? Guptas lawyer trying to manipulate but Zondo refusing his arm twisted Wait. Did I hear her say Duduzane Gupta? Evidence leader is confused and not focusing at all I thought the chair call for tea break Evidence leader is incompetent and confused Mentor and this evidence leader will mess up things Guptas must be summoned to appear in person otherwise it won't be fair for them to sit somewhere and use lawyers to cross exam witnesses in the commission Zondo is trying to help Mentor out of trouble Zondo is basically telling Mentor to becarefull not to lie under oath bcos he has seen something "Nkanyosa Ndlovu This session is so confusing bcos both the evidence leader and the witness are confused Mrs Mentor motive to testify need to be probed it's witness like Vytjie Mentor who will render the commission's work useless "Nelson Musoliwa
KATLEGO BANDA,She seems shy bundle of joy 😂😂😂 she's very shy... she feels intimidated n paranoid
Ndikho Mangisa,hash mass up She is a mess
peter pott,What in the world are they doing? mcebisi Jonas also will mess things up like this
Violet Legodi,Aaai Aaai Aaai Aaai 😏 Ashuwe Vytjie 😂😂
Lindikaya Myeki,@Sityebi you are so silly lol this is really bad why giving priority to Guptas that undermine our country? I agree@Slindile Ngcobo Stop Duduzane Gupta lol woooooow there we go Home affairs might not be a reliable source remember Jigaba has people there. They should ask for records on the venue in China where the DTI thing took place wooooooow this advocate @gcina nkosi you might be right Im sure Juptas are happy with this revelation SABC It seems that Ms Mental has lot of flaws
Lesiba Chokoe,This Advocate jeses
Frik Brits,This mess looks like South Africa in general @Pitso Mosetlhe thats why this channel need a few moderators. @Дарина Фомина Get lost. SABC we need moderators here @Anne M. I have done that.
Kids Collie,How are they not prepared? Here we go again with the searching @Street Cred Only a young person can be so arrogant "State Capture AKA ""Tea Break"" Inquiry" @Street Cred So stop typing here then
Christopher Pitt,A week to prep and now this..no man. Tea time is only so long Musi wants 2 more provinces when the DA win 2 hours and nothing has happened... Imagine the ANC did go out of power...what a day that would be I wonder if Zondo reprimands these Advocates after. Such a poor job done today cousin1...have you not been watching
Nobby's Photography,well organised I must say no wonder a lot of cases are thrown out
Nelson Musoliwa,Bit embarassing Lets all echo the expression that it is human to err. Her testimony is bit confusing today
Buti Mothoa,mara this advocate 😢
StarManRSA,Can somebody summarise what is going on here for me? @Pitso Mosetlhe what about the bundles? Can you please ellaborate? Can anybody tell me what the delay is from? "Thanks @Grayboy ... Seems everyone here has an opinion Thanks everyone 😃 Who is Randburg?
Phakamisa Mtati,Embracement for the crooks guyz not blacks come on problem is that she wants lie nothing else
Sinekhaya Njovu,To be fair to the advocate exhibits should be sorted out by the attorney not her Again the attorney who happens to be male needs to deal with files not this advocate
Olusegun David,Deliberate attempt to scuttle the cross-examination otherwise how can she come to such important occasion with moduled up files She doesn't even feel remorseful for a shoddy job..and soon somebody will claim blacks are not being employed like their white counterparts....a white advocate wont make such blunder Mentor submitted affidavit yesterday...really All video must be shown to the PUBLIC....Ventor has lied and must be exposed Tactical waste of time knowing Ventor has on;y 2 days to be cross examined...Zondo is allowing to waste time "Poor and lazy advocate She is now blabbing her mouth....lol..lol..lol..lol She is just disgracing hardworking black African women.... She must be tried criminally for lying to a commission set up by SA Constitution... Agriizi must be cross-examined and the whole world we get to see and hear about the truth Zondo is trying to defend Ventor...but the whole world is watcjing Shame....her children and siblings will be feeling ashamed She wrote a book ....and I m sure the content of such book will be full of lies This advocate is totally unprofessional ..she is even leaking a sweet in her mouth...this not acceptable ZONDO can not protect a liar else the credibility of the commission will be destroyed
Gilbert Lawrence,Why is Mrs Mentor Incognito today. SABC!!! A microcosm of our justice system on display.
SHON JON INTERNET CAFE & PRINTING SHOP DIEPSLOOT,"I can be a better adv
Bheki Mdletshe,The Bosasa scandal got me thinking that the Guptas were small fish to fly. This advocate was unprepared and it is annoying. All other evidence leaders never had a problem with bundles She is not a reliable witness. Too much anger towards Zuma - there are already holes in her testimony I want Bosasa - the Guptas are too small. Nope. Vytie exaggerated the story. She forgot that these records will come. Now apologising yebanna
Herbert Khwezi,They got the info last night. I don’t blame the adv. this is an attorneys job.

Ali Tebele,lots of mistakes today where is the lovely registrar we must not put colour wer colour is not needed we all make mistakes this Lawyer is rude very rude he takes this light very kight *light @Tho the Gupta lawyer takes the sitting not serious
Indoda Yamaqiniso,A file stuck in Ramaphosa's nose. He just needs to sneeze🤧wherever he is and then we will have the commission going ahead. "They were just heading for Zuma and this commission will fail to find anything directly linked to him "But I'm just telling you that this commission with turn badly and swallow those who've been acting holier. "She didn't miss it Zondo seems compromised and seeks a certain outcome of this Commission. "it's not just him who must view a video Zondo doesn't want the public to see the original video Exactly! We should also lose borders back to what it used to be before settlers partitioned our land amongst themselves. "This woman sounds very angry "You come to the commission to give evidence Zondo is more a pastor than a judge. This judge😠👹 your time...? 🧐 "Exploiting and looting as opposed to ""exploring""." This woman is about to be exposed by documented hard paper evidence😂🤣🤸🏿‍♂️⛹🏿‍♂️🤾🏿‍♂️ She panicking already😭 "The Guptas have never refused to come to testify to the commission Zondo stated that he's refusing them access because they're out of the country. The media has messed up with a lot of you. """secretly""? Why are you lying?" "Sean The rabbit is in the bag🤣🤣 Fakey Mentor She's a fairytale teller this one This one belongs to a mental institution for more mentor[ship]. This commission will unseat Ramaphosa🤞🏿 Just follow the commission and come back to comment here once it has happened Duduzani Gupta is no longer supposed to be funny Duduzani as opposed to Duduzane. "Most of the so called ""evidence"" provided on this commission are lies. It's even more interesting that all the implicated are yet to present their versions of the story🏌🏿‍♂️🤸🏿‍♂️" This commission has also exposed people's intelligence like how could they trust one sided evidence before the implicated can answer for themselves. "@Michael Michael "It's Nkanyiso Are you some Gujarat boy or something? "No Look her hands Her voice is shaky and she's trying very hard to bring herself together Flight manifest received🤭🤧 People called us names when we in the first instance told them this fatty is a liar.
NONHLANHLA NTULI,Cant someone fix the graphic its LOOKS like I WILL me ..... @SABC Digital News
patrick mukatshelwa,Aooow Ndlovu really Guys sitting there is nt a walk in the park "Should we vote ANC out Freedom of Transvaal?kwakwaaa Cope?i can’t see them coming back shame
jeevan singh,Disgrace what is not bad nobody will go to jail. trust me. agree Malebo Imagine the Guptas and Zuma getting locked up. Now imagine a small hungry black boy stealing fruits from his neighbors tree. who do you think will most likely get locked up. Wow just by the names on this chat. I wonder who is working at their organizations and who is not. I'm self employed. Go back to work no it's dead njapa🤣🤣🤣🤣 what diary
Antone Khobi,here we go
Kaboon Viper,Cheese kops lost the files. mxm True that @Parabridge Its not an error. Its poor planning. Like some race groups are always late and some always on time. Gupta rep on point. This commission is just a dress rehearsal. I want to see politicians locked up Is Eheee. Eheee a south african thing. Clean Shaven Cheese kop. He's captured. Zondo insist that Guptas should appear in person. I second that Zuma sold the country for a plate of curry. Still cant get over that. Go Vytjie Listen carefully You're out of order comrade. Anyone under trauma's battles with recalling events. give her a break "Gupta are already in contempt "Guptas sponsored 100m Wedding Cough away form the mic @Mfundo Veerasamy vele Serving the Guptas. They believe they can fly and never come back. Malusi Gigaba - pulled the string at Home Affairs at the time Malusi Gigaba now playing with himself in the mirror watching this. Imagine this in your moth. @nkululeko njapha Mulusi gave the Guptas Citizenship illegally Vytjie has top informants in high places. Listen Carefully "Duduzane Gupta. Salty. ""-)" Point in case. the Wedding. They were given permission to land by Number One. Flaky testimony by Vytjie Info from home affairs should be inadmissible. Nothing credible can come from home affairs. Mentor has allot of info but when it comes to presentation the wheels come off. Nothing. Vytjie is doing more harm to her public persona by her inconsistent testimony. Cell phone records are more credible then Home Affairs records Cell phone locations can be traced very accurately to proof or disproof their locations. Likes she's pulling new evidence from nowhere . Making the story up to fit the adv question. Vytjie is wasting time. How far is the Hawks the arrest of the politicians. Nje. @Tholithemba Ntsele we will suspend your account for a while in violation of our Youtube policies @Simon Mabunda we will suspend your account for a while in violation of our Youtube policies @Tholithemba Ntsele Nowwe. @Tholithemba Ntsele Dont come push your broken agenda here. @Tholithemba Ntsele bring it on Masekind

Sthakathi Khumalo,Zondo is not having it Guptas had captured even home affairs though. but they will get away as usual Dudu Gupta The subtitles make my life thixo!! Although they are automated but are the best thing ever!! Missing legs LOOLS.. Sandla Zulu Mageba.. ngivele ngafa yinsini Missing legs guys "Vytjie must pay us back our data Who is this force with glasses and snoopy styled hair?? The hairstyle name is gone with English and missing legs/Lags There are not death threats to a weak/lying individual.. if she simply speaks the truth there will be no inconsistencies Tshepo Monama Sad thing is how can we prove this? If Vytlie has side boyfriends... we might even here husband asking but you said you were visiting friends A hostile witness... the best description ever!! Where did you sleep that particular day? Zuma wants Mcebisis

Antonie Goosen,Ummm.....ehh.....ummm....ehhhh.. credibility - she thinks it means 'put it on the credit card' some of us will not...care haha so much talk but nothing really being said no lunch/ tea break - any interruption may cause Mentor to forget why she is there and what she said earlier @African Refugee Agree! Politicians should get hefty sentences - they abuse the trust of the people Hello?? SABC didn't pay their Youtube licence. Vote for anyone else than ANC and EFF - let someone else steal for a change haha @Tholithemba Ntsele I like Melema but he will completely lose it with too much power. Huge risk for SA Zondo very frustrated - things moving too slow @Дарина Фомина one word - FUGLY
Briony French,"any videographer has editing tools. can tell any story. we need raw footage untampered Guptas must die lol cope does not = afriforum ha ha 🤣 cope is better than afriforum we should have known that the anc was corrupt how many of them went to jail before? we should actually all not vote at all. dont show up boycott the vote until this corruption cloud is donw done whats everyones take on us losing provinces back to how it was before? innocent please how much of a better life? they stole everything look this woman was a terrible witness the first time. she stumbles alot and she sounds unreliable. i think she should and others should be allowed to testify in their home language. maybe they were adopted "she is a terrible witness maybe the guptas travelled on dubai or Indian passports under their other names... remember they had to hide everything so deletion is probable. i am waiting for the cash heists to be the way bosasa got cash to bribe the world to get jobs that they want. seeing as a anc member was already caught in the act of a heist.
Noah King,Anyone in power should not be trusted in this day and age What is all this about I live in America and have no idea what’s going on Mama go home pray to the devil you serve Let the evil one still everything from you except never let them steal your nails She eat baby for breakfast
Mr Tee,why Zondo is dodging the video drama queen Vitjie is lying what's the need of all these explanations we all know how the home affairs work why him alone the whole team would have gone without home affairs school her Mr Zondo this is an embarrassment.. really

nkululeko njapha,just release the video wabanjwa muntu atul was never in China hai madoda kwashuba kakhulu I have realised that no matter what the Guptas say. People have already made their mind which sad really this advocate mara what does malusi have to do with this now. You guys have serious problems. Ite has been proven that one brother was here in the country yet you still refuse to listen. lets be objective This cross axamiation has nothing to do with Gigaba you are just name droping for no reason now people will say he left illegally now bringing wate kloof for no reason lies lies Exactly Prince using the wedding to hide this woman is lying who must we trust home affairs or mentor @MZONKE CEBISA State """home affairs lied"" and now ""Emirates Lied""" this is funny lol mistake lol this woman is in trouble more credible than emirates just files come on man advocate is messing up now shes tired "we first blamed Home affairs The problem is that peple have been convinced that Zuma and the Guptas are the most corrupt people in the world. No matter what evidence suggest they will still dismiss it. @Felix Muyoba if the resolution were they can be removed. This woman hai hai hai!!!!! She flew using a broom. if she knew that mango didn't carry that infor she would have said mango Sinked? @Tshepo Monama Guptsa used fly emirates. It is not wrong to accept that what you thought was right is actually wrong. All these questions seem to be question the commission investigation. Now we are looking for everything that didn't happen. Maybe Myeni deleted the records and Gigaba manipulated records at home affairs. The Fly emirates records are questionable. She lied accept. This advocate is messing using a broom @Trevor mokobake parliaments records were manipulated Myeni
