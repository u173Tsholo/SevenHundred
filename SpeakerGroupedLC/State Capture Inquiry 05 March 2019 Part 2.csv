Magda Seguin,Part 1 is on Youtube @Gabsile Siyaya...go to search and type in state capture live on sabc digital Adv Madonsela naned the document State of Capture:Secure in Comfort..it is exactly what Zuma is enjoying now Zuma is parading on Twitter and Zuma wife no 5 is uploading pics of their glamourous life on Instagram...nauseating EFF is populist....they condone the disasters like Venezuela and Zimbabwe...they Will make SA a total failed state.The promises in their manifesto are fairy tales Mantashe is wasting money...on this very YT you can explore the truth from the Venezuela people themselves "@Ben Cole I agree...Chavez nationalised everything hoping oil money will make a difference People who believe the EFF nationalisation plans should take heed Mantashe himself is caught up in state capture...it's a joke that he wants to take a 'fact finding' trip when the world knows the situation in Venezuela Venezuela is very familiar to me for personal reasons.Mantashe is wasting tax money....again Look what 'quiet diplomacy of SA did to Zimbabwe.....The ANC propped up Mugabe for more than 30 years and ignored serious human rights violations I blocked all the racists on this timeline...I ignore racist comments and block...there is too much hatred being spewed on a continuous basis on all social media platforms.Very destructive. @Mike Lock communism is a failed ideology...some people never got the memo @Cerebis thank you! I tell myself everyday that bots and trolls will not affect me but they are so insidious and prevalent.Many of them are paid by entities to further their nefarious ends. Multitasking üòÑ The entire Eskom hearings here at the Commission is interconnected.Listening everyday is a spider web of I interconnection..it's only the characters that change daily What can be more important?
Gabsile Siyaya,I cant find part 1
welton paulse,they must give this guy a penalty for wasting time 783 thousand and million and hundred "@david jacobs Can we just agree that CORRUPTION is a STATE OWN ENTITY on its own "I would want the government to be criminally charged as well

Phumlani Mhlongo,üòé
Malopo Rathobela,@welton paulse ü§û
Ben Cole,CR said he will only take action against Cabinet (NEC) members once he received Zondo's report. "@John James. unfortunately @Darryl Lavis. Are we a democracy or socialist state? The power in the latter is centralised and benefits an elitist group at the expense of the majority. @Magda Seguin. Venezuela is a failed socialist state. The governing party is sending a fact finding mission to Venezuela under leadership of its Secretary General. To find out what?

A R,share the power give the DA then EFF next
carnoth ngomane,"The ANC will win the next election whether we like it or not with the right approach EFF could topple ANC "@Bridgette Kekana i agree with you The only reason that makes white hate Eff is because they are not scared to speak their minds and they speak for black people and they preach EQULITY in all spheres an that is a threat to wmc @ Bridgette we will give him a chance and he will be president "@ Danie i dont condone killing anyone irrespective of his or her race @ Indoda well said As long as America and Britain doesnt get to control any state sanctions will be applied "@ Indoda
Darryl Lavis,Apartheid existed because there was no democracy. That is all different now "@ Ben Cole
Joel Mzayidume,Maimane and his DA have nothing to offer the majority of South Africans. EFF will overtake them. ANC has been messing up for 25 years. ANC will win based on inertia. The ignorant masses are still in the dark so they'll vote for what they've always voted for. Enlightened ones will take their votes elsewhere "@Bridgette Kekana people will b voting for a party "@Magda Seguin the chairman of the ANC
Wildthing,Joel since when is it that a party must offer anything. its peoples tax money that pays for things. people need to learn that. you get what you put in. EFF can't offer what they don't have. jobs need to be created. exports improved. unions rights reduced or removed. Government sets the rules and should apply them. and people need to know the truth. I don't understand share the wealth of the country. I know that rather as work hard and honest that will benefit all. no free handouts. in Zuma stole from all for his and his familys gains. ha ha you dreaming. ha ha now you going after Indians think you getting blocked now bye

Do you agree that Zuma actually did try to do the same for black people what Verwoerd was trying to do for Afrikaners?
