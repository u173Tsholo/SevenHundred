Val Speirs,another Indian fellow Another Snake charmer A Snake Charmer 🐍 He looks like Yousuf Lehur nervous NUMBER ONE CAN ONLY COUNT TO ONE He talks like a racing snake I think a baddie as he enabled the changes of costs. He is implicated trying to dig himself out of a rabbit hole Wait.the next witness is the one that implicated Yusuf Lehur Trains that did not fit in the tracks. DURBAN IS LITTLE INDIA He has all these points he raised but where is the proof? More people die in taxi accidents than the carona virus . CNN would say that 13 people died of Covid-19 in a taxi 😁 The next witness implicated him Kallard is the next witness @Paul..👍 Imagine where this country would be now if it had not been looted. True..Moyo Spreadsheets China is a Communist regime. In 2013 the 1064 locomotive cost R38 million R49000 000 - R38000 000= R11000 000 difference The 1064 locomotives priced at R38 million transnet pays R49 million per locomotive. Yusuf knows the pricing was inflated so he is implicated. 🤯🤯🤯 Nonese Nonsense

Its estimated ANC steal 19 @Patrick .Solarnfo me to these useless Hawks are completely incompetant & corrupt & I can only assume they have been captured like the ANC & EFF by the Steinhof mafia1 or why no action ?#voetsekANC @Sheperd Moyo History will reflect that liberation movements even ones like the once great & honest ANC are crap at running a government#VoetsekANC "@Sheperd Moyo if Cele is implicated and I have no douht he is guilty of corruption - he was already fired once for corruption of R1 @Sheperd Moyo the Hawks are not independant they report to Cele who reports to CR so my question remains @Sheperd Moyo so u believe that Cele will sit back and even assist his police to invesitgage him so he can go to jail! "@Sheperd Moyo but the Hawks report to him. He is Hawks boss. Respectfully you can seriously believe that a man fired once for corruption of R1 "@Oupa Ariel Motaung well if the MIn of police is being investigated by Zodo commission & was fired for R1 @Oupa Ariel Motaung respectfully If the ANC government is happy to appoint exposed liars & thieves like Zwane & Joemat-Peterson to parliamnt if we are not a banana republic what are we? @Sheperd Moyo so who will arrest Cele I am wanting to understand? I am not wishing to offend simply cant accept that the MIN of Police will allow himself to arrested. Am I wrong to be sceptical.? @Sheperd Moyo again respectfully u believe a man who has proved to us is a thief will stand down of his own accord and allow himself to be arrested? @Sheperd Moyo so we can agree Cele will not arrest himself his juniors will not arerest him & this does not bother you? How do you think then we can fgo forward if there are no consequences of theft
ZombieRockful,"ANC members stole money from public funds and after say:""We DeFeNd oUr DeMoCrAcY.""" ANC and EFF stole milions and milions of money from funds for public heath and after say the problem in SA is represented by an old flag
Tseko Sehlare,The wheels of justice are grinding the conscience of each and every thief slowly. It's time for the big guns to prepare to be grinded too. Magashule must prepare his overall size.
BanditZA,Problem is who will fill the vacuum left by the ANC? It will obviously be the EFF and that is not an optimal state of affairs @Mike Clark How about a reduction of ANC power which will birth an era of coalition politics? Power distributed seems better but consensus is also hard to reach — could stall @Jabu Malinga you insult the chair and do not show it due respect This witness is strong His testimony is important because he is nailing the higher ups. He will be unemployable after this. Much respect Usually DCJ intervenes to rephrase questions when witness is dodging. This witness is straight and answers to the point and question "@MIKE DURBAN just because you are unable to follow the evidence being LED for you @Walter Zikalala well said 💪🏽 I’m afraid the quality of discourse is falling in this chat. Engaged political discourse is being replaced by dog whistling and mild racism
