PELEGELE THABISO,Rest in peace baba 😭🙏
mandisi ntauzana,Adv Garth Hulley SC i suspect he is a brilliant criminal law counsel.
Easy D,Let's hope it goes towards his legal team.... Yes just started @ Bev Daniels "Oh the antic of this witness Oh he attended yesterday ... why didn't he prepare for today... always excuses... he want to stop ..the questions...LOL... Yes i agree.. all criminals should/must be prosecuted @jones noah Banda.. Oops the volume... Ok tea-break..well that make sense... I hope the witness don't start complaining of stomach pains.. next....:elbowcough: There're are protocols that must be followed..... A witness definition of a report... really this is babble... I think the only way you can ever get a straight answer from this guy.. is by water-boarding...😆😆 and a bit of integrity... Exactly ... this action is known as gross misconduct and is a criminal offence.... now stop using these hypothetical scenarios .... to hide your incompetence..it's pathetic... Also that's when my cat gave birth to 6 kittens... and the my Koi-fish arrived... really..... The witness gave long distracting scenarios deliberately... avoiding answering the questions... Yes ... Judge slowly lead him into the pit..... clearly he was crap at his job.... Ah who's now asking the questions...?????? he just can't follow procedures..... even now... he's panicking guys.... uh oh.....😳 pure contradictions through out.... now stop the babbling ... oh he's now a language expert.... lol... Exactly..:@ Dominic Przybylski ../
Bev Daniels,"Morning all Thank you "@Avis "He is corrupt @Abel because he does not want to answer any questions in case he puts his foot in it. No the kraal at Nkandla "@Mbuso "@Alex "He says there are rules and regulations in government "Morning Ishaad Mr Nhleko holds a Diploma in labour law from the Graduate Institute of Management and Technology. "True voters do not realize what they are voting for "OH DEAR Yes he is nervous that is why he tries to joke out of it - drowning "@Peter Little jack horner is now in the corner "He had just said he did not ""instruct"" but ""requested"" but his affidavit says instructed"
Anthony Ramasike,lets hope it goes well today Lol..@Mbuso the name ANC only does not steal
Mbuso Ndlovu,This guy looks corrupt to me Zuma must come back and finish hi term Zuma stole few millions in two terms. 50 BILLIONS is gone before Cyril finishes his first term 😁😁😁😁😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂😁😁😂😂 @Bev Daniels then let's allow Malema to lead us @Dominic Przybylski I think there is no one in this world who have clean hands Chair is getting paid by an hour the more this nonsense last the bigger his pocket😁😂😁😂 @Thobela Wem This commission is a waist of CASH @Val Speirs We need someone like Trumph
Abel Matshidiso,why all of a sudden Mr Ntlheko's voice sounds like a pig mmmmmg mmmmg he seems to not like saying a simple yes @Bev Daniels kkkkkkkk did mr. fire pool ask for tea break again Mr fire pool forgot that he just confirmed that the signature is his "the evedince leader is calm and focused
Alvino Theunissen,The Chair Zondo protecting Mr. Ntlheko's not acceptable that is the duty of his lawyer. I wont mind a Trump here as President he wont accept any theft and or corruption create employment. @Peet Venter -agree only hard when he want to hurry up the Evidence lead. Agree @Val Speirs The CNN fake news try promote the Democrate Agenda so many networks in US doing the same. He want to divert by saying its a cultural issue! Agree Arian David Tuer- hehehe @Thozamile Yapi - The chair allowing the diversion! He is caught out😂🤣 Definition of Offence: a breach of law or rule; or illegal act...... @Bev Daniels- agree "@Singi Mathebula - Yes
Dominic Przybylski,Who in ANC does not steal? @Mbuso Ndlovu I don't trust Gucci Revolutionaries. Why can't we lead ourselves. Do adults really need someone else to tell them what to do? I don't like Zille but she did rescue Cape Town. CT was fast slipping into ANC scenario of corruption and mismanagement before she took control. People confuse being politically correct with being an effective leader. A politically correct person doesn't have the guts to be unpopular so cannot be a real leader. This small talk is such a waste of time. Why waste electricity when it's very easy to wear a jersey at no cost. Corruption consumes wealth without replacing it. Ultimate effect of corruption is destitution. Those with wealth will leave. Those without it will starve to death. @Askar Niko02 Eh? @David Tuer Agreed. Zondo is trying to get Nhleko to admit that he possesses at least a small vestige of common sense. Actually cannot have much common sense if he considered a fancy swimming pool to be a security feature. "To obtain ""absolute clarity"" surely the first step is to ask the people who produced the report to clarify??" New application of Stalingrad tactics. He'll just carry on talking until he dies of old age. Come on Zondo. Control you witness. Don't let him control you. He is still not answering the question. The answer is obviously NO. @Val Speirs You may be right. The politically correct brigade have become so aggressive and intimidating that many probably lie in opinion polls. I feel sorry for Hulley. Zondo has turned him into a spectator. This man is speaking gibberish. Zondo is encouraging Nhleko in his time wasting. Why? Only commission of inquiry which achieved an outcome was the Nugent commission. Nugent didn't allow time-wasting. Zondo you have been wasting time and waffling. You are responsible. Hour and a half if the chairperson doesn't intentionally waste time. Zondo has been delaying with Nhleko. I am now suspicious of Zondo. I don't understand why he has been and still is wasting so much time. "This man is addicted to tea-breaks @Gugulethu Xhosans I don't like it when people waste time. @Gugulethu Xhosans I have been a fan of Zondo for a while but this is taking far too long at huge expense. We need to see results. Two years and not a single interim report allowing corrective action. This is excruciating. """I'm also on the one had... blah de blah..."" ""and yesterday I have made an allegation you have stolen a goat.."" Come on Zondo control your witness." about time Zondo "This reminds me of a quote ""The person who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client.""" If you have to investigate without assuming guilt then how do you choose who to investigate? Do you investigate everybody?
Mario Johnson,morning everyone seems like everyones jus postponing
Thobela Wem,"would we ever see anyone getting charged and arrested from this "@Mbuso Ndlovu
reggi,Wow Hellen Ziĺle to lead the country....thats a joke ofcourse she would rescue CT im not surprised The country would be a proper Animal Farm.....her twèets are a depiction of that. Then who is in if they are on their way out? m . The calm that is Harley....
Daphne Van Diemen,ek hou net om na die saak te luister en hou hoe die chair alles hanteer
Val Speirs,Helen Zille for President Out with the ANC CANCER "I hope Covid - 19 takes out the ANC  I am patriot of Trumps. At least he puts people first and creates jobs . ANC are on their way out just wait till the Virus gets them. "I thought this Witness was meant to take a short period of time but he is playing games with the Commission. Time for Zondo and Counsel to take control and put questions that requires "" Yes"" or ""No""." Rubbish . Trump is no COMPARISON to ANC. You watch too much of the Corrupt News Network ..CNN If Trump was our President our economy would be booming. "Trump will win again Thanks to Zuma This Commission of Enquiry is all Smoke and Mirrows setup by the ANC to make people think they are actually doing something about their corruption. I have had many cups of coffee and I am very alert . Pops... dont be a dork Absolutely Must move on to the next Witness this one is not cooperative . Witness telling the Commission what to do Yes Hubert..that is why I say it is all Smoke and Mirrors.
Martin van der Breggen,"I am listening does not mean a “yes” - please answer the question It’s cold Only when you are in the HOT SEAT Zondo mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm sounds like a Hippo stupidity is also obviously an answer ask no questions and tell no lies.........here comes the cough........so we will need to take a 3 week break so he can consult with his master JZ "@dominic there is a HUGE difference between an SOP and a LAW......... How did he ever become a Minister in the first place agreeing with the Chair is disrespectful and should not be entertained "Sorry 1.5 hours if we don't need to listen to Nhlekos duck and dive "can this FOOL just say yes or no is that his first or second affadvit?????? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 BUST!!!!!! "@singi
kim polly,The ANC must know they are on the way out of power ... looting is in full gear .. closing down sale anyone would be better smoke break
bongani khumalo,Nami ake ningibize nizongibuza zonke lezinganekwane enibuzana Zona lapho
Peet Venter,"Chair
adrian albertyn,They have not paid the heating account. I am going for a walk I had enough of this nonsense.
Mohamed Mia,Infrastructure old what do you expect . Don’t act stupid everything is screwed up in this freaking country Simpler English don’t act dumb Cough cough cough Pee break This guy such a bs Cough cough and
jones noah Banda,If one minister or two can go to jail I think it will make a difference
Maxwell Muza,too academic for simple questions
Michael Moeketsi Sello,Hahahaha What’s going on guys
katlego wasp,oh... i was about to smash my router and nou??
Gabisile Mabuza,sound?
B H,Former minister Nhleko is using delay tactics to stall the questioning in an effort to have more time to think about his answers. "Commissions are different from court rooms in that the Chair Commission inquisitions are the most tedious and boring things. This is not a courtroom!!! Gerda 7 Welcome to commission inquiries. That's what they often do because they trying to establish clarity around an issue. "Exactly Mr. Chair Mr. Nhleko is giggling because he realizes he's painted himself into a corner. "Mr. Nhleko is speaking in abstract terms about ""possibilities"" that could arise in organizational structures. He's not clarifying the position he took when presented with the 2 reports. He's delaying" Mr. Nhleko STOP TALKING!!!!!!!!! @Margaret Waterboer...THANK YOU!!!!:dothefive: "@Val Speirs a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer is not in the terms of reference for this commission inquiry. This is not a court room madam." Nathi Nhleko is smart at deflection and expending times allocated. THANK YOU MR NHLEKO! Finally answering a question. That is the point. Crime intelligence cannot investigate itself because it's wrong!
Ntokozo Mkhize,mute🤷🏾‍♂️
itumeleng angelinna,tea break
Andrew Chipakata,volume is not there please when resume let there be sound
Roy Kisten,is this hoke Gona give Alli a chance to question him this guy should be a headmaster he says to Zondo Look look look look this guy got Zondo commission under his finger tips but why is Zondo giving this guy so much leeway cracking jokes aswell this guy should apply for a headmaster job this police commissioner delaying tactics
Andre Marr,hello my fellow laggers
Gerda 7,Are we busy with a lecture again? Ivan Vries👍 This is the 3rd point that hes trying to explain for half an hour .He cannot answer one question straight!! Davd Tuer 🤣😂 This guy is enjoying the attention !! "N Another day will be enough for them. Shut up and move on with it!! No lunch break and go on till 6pm... that will be enough time for them. Answer the bloody question!! Dominic👍
Alex Ngoy,This Bra knows exactly what he is doing by avoiding to answer questions This is not the same Bra who told South Africans that Nkandla needed more money to finish the work????
Ishaad Mohammed,Morning All Are we still on about the 2 reports 🙆
Ben Fraser,But he received the later report before the fist report. He is leading the commission of enquiry.
David Tuer,DCJ seems to continually interrupt Hulley's line of questioning while allowing the witness to wax long on all kinds of sideroads. Dominic- he's not trying very hard. Sounds like a Grade7 school debate. I'm amazed Hulley can remember where he was before the debate over nothing started. Where does Trump figure here? Try to focus.! Isaiah--What are you doing? Dominic- seems to me that there is some problem between Zondo and Hulley. "Val-- Listening to this load of tripe Sibusio-- It was supposed to finish before lunch yesterday. This witness is now deciding how long the commission must sit!!!! Fair is not the right word. Try complicit. "Dominic--I too have been impressed by Zondo DCJ asks a question and then gives the answer too!!! ROY--Which one? I don't think he need worry that he will at some time work for the commission.!!
Michelle Wright,I can’t even🙄🙄 Trying to look clever They are both excruciatingly boring I find it very concerning that they can be laughing about this. Seriously I think so @Guglethu Xhosans
Kevin Simon,"Yes Trying to justify why he chose the report that suited his perspective. Surely faced with the conflicting findings as well as the timing from March to Dec he should have delved deeper. If this guy was my subordinate I would have charged him with dereliction of duty. He took a decision without considered all the facts at his disposal. Bruce. Yes as did the USA.🤣🤣🤣🤣 "In fact Val. 63 million is less than 65 million. So no silent majority
Gugulethu Xhosans,uyaxoka Nhleko. He also assumed that the first report could be the correct one because it serves his agenda. Nhleko is obfuscating @Michelle Wright I would guess they wanted to channel him into his illusional world of lame sarcasm. You would have seen Nhleko's stinking attitudinal approach "@Michelle Wright I guess he does not want to give him grounds to say the process is /was unfair to him @Dominic Przbylski . I guess Zondo could see Nhleko has a stinking attitude towards him just to frustrate him. @Dominic Przybylski . Hayi suka you have a vendetta against Zondo. This is not a court of law nor criminal matter for that matter. @Dominic of cause time will be wasted because this not a court of law. Understanding that to make excuses that they are sick for example would not put them in jail. Therefore Zondo wants to be fair .
R hunter,Ha ha talking himself into a corner. He keeps explaining the processes but clearly didn't follow them as he so elegantly states... ...hook line and sinker coming up! Am confident "In my opinion
Ivan vries,i thought these arrogant firepool minister is has finished his testimony yeasterday the man said he is even beter then laywers but just listen how he corner himself
Bruce Thackwell,mentally bankrupt trough feeder never trust a overweight politician "he thinks he is a practitioner of governance! Holy man of governance Trump for president South African Voters got what they deserved...this clown "I see you support the USA democrats phew
Hamarang 3D هەمەڕەنگ,😘😘 😍😍😍 😘😘😘
gaxaza,This is just a waste of time and money
Kevin,I wonder what was this guys salary per month and all the perks ? How can he have had the necessary competence to fill that post. It's obvious it was substantial...he is very well fed. @Margareth Waterboer .....Trump learned his tricks from our government....we are world leaders in corruption If this goes to trial he will be lambasted ... @Margareth Waterboer .... Well to be honest 90% of all world leaders are corrupt. Its just that they have the brains to cover it up and not be so greedy. Imagine if JZ and this dude sit down at a table with a few bottles of wine....eish 😂 It is this dudes opportunity to clear the allegations made against him...he has not done that so give him more rope. This is what JZ is allowing him to do without actually saying it. JZ is actually being sneaky..he asks him same questions but in another way and also answers his question. Then the idiot disagrees and spins another story...He is contradicting himself poor fool. @MIKE DURBAN ....its part of the plan Mike..he is being set up and given rope. It is tedious but necessary. @holeng masemola .... nor does the witness know the story line....it changes 😂
Ettiene Meyer,if you are not educated and have experience you will see policies only as guidelines to suit your agenda!
Isaiah Gatjeni Mangalani Ndlovu,lets focus on state capture inquiry "lets rather focus on what led Nhleko to be on that chat of state inquiry IS JUST A WASTE OF MONEY No one was ever found guilty STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994
malcolm payne,stop indulging this slippery clown this idiocy! why is zondo allowing this stream of lies and drivel from the witness?
Pops Rampersad,"@val speirs "@Val Spiers "@Val "@Val Spiers indeed @Godfrey. in fact PROCLAMATION NO. R. 24 OF 2020 allows the the HAWKS & NPA to immediately commence with investigations and prosecutions
Margareth Waterboer,@Kevin I agree with our situation. Trump was corrupt before he became leader.
bheki bekzin,State capture inquiry...Anyone ever found guilty? Anyone ever been arrested? or just a waste of money.
Gammid32,it all sounds very fire-poolish like reminds me of that day in parly...
Yoliswa Sukati,this guy is wasting our time... this will take years and tax payers money........ he hasnt answered anything..

Sibusiso Zulu,"I am so worried about the answers given by Minister Nhleko and too much of examples he's giving adv Mokhari interject quit often!!!!! 2 hours due to delaying tactics of Nhleko or even more than that "how was even the""minister""been appointed to head sich ministry if he can't even understand the functions of saps components!!!! political appointees sometimes are problematic"
Sebastian MoAfrika,the sarcasm of lawyers!
Lebonetse Cyprian,"he thinks that he can command anywhere
justin styles,LAW & ORDER
Craven Morehead,Moving at a snails pace as per usual
Godfrey Mama,This is a commission of inquiry not a court or kangaroo court. At the end Zondo might recommend criminally to be charge implicated persons and negligent individuals. "I also like judge Nugent old dispensation and Zondo new order Advocate Hulley is he the Son of KZN Senior Advocate very cool?
Pat Kingsley,Ponderous and clumsy. Where is Kate?
Schalk Van Der Merwe,How do you make the biggest financial scandal in the history of South Africa so boring? Not that anythig is going to come out of this apart from another 7% pay increase for ANC members
Ania Teo,Mr firepool. He can spin any crap to deflect. Hurley or Hulley. Big difference. One should be jailed
MIKE DURBAN,Geeeeez....this Nathi fella is really running the show hey.... The CJ is entertaining Nathi fella way too much......geeeez Soory to say....but the CJ must catch a wake up...... Zondo is allowing this Bra to run the show....very frustrating...... The untouchable police minister it seems...... @Kevin ...Geeez...true...but very frustrating etc... @Kevin .....Man....as long as all this goes to the law courts etc etc.......
makhosi nobhatyi,I think Zondo is waiting for him at the end

Arian Bester,This guy thinks he is untouchable give him a lollipop
Barbara Sattler,It becomes uncomfortable when you have to lie.
Mduduzi Thabede,I think judge Nugent would have sorted out this fellow jeer!!! "In essence he doesn’t want to answer this question 😀😀😀 😀😀😀
Thozamile Yapi,"He is manipulating them! every time things seem to get tense
Arthur Dell,"His verbal diareha is worse that Covid 19 If he is not GUILTY then I am!!! He is attacking Hulley because he is being cornered in a serious way
Derek Auret,Is this a Commission of Enquiry or a comfortable fire-side chat?
Samuel Skosana,Judge Nugent should have conducted this interview
holeng masemola,i cant seem to get the story line behind this gentlemen here and seriously are this endless examples necessary though
Hilton Walbrugh,"what was planned for one day "even now Did this minister read his own affidavit before he signed it? I wonder if he chews his lunch as slowly as he answers questions.
Sfiso Zondi,"@Hilton
Name Name,i don't know who he is fooling with these responses do they even read these comments
welton paulse,i like this evidence leader @Abel Matshidiso he is very stern and professional in his approach "@Hilton Walbrugh i think to add to your question one should ask how many of the documents did He familiarize himself with This guy is a story teller "Mr Hulley is one of those hardworking guys where you just look at him
