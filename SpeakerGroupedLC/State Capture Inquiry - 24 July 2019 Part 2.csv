Talent P Sibisi,wiNdoda Dlamini Sound please name of this is????? thank u
babette fagan,wish sabc would pull their finger out.
Dominic Przybylski,Zondo is always late. This may be very interesting testimony. @Jabu Malinga Zuma was probably corrupt from birth. Arms deal advertised JZ as somebody who took bribes so all bribers were interested in dealing with him. If they were offering R600 million to buy a finance minister I guess a president isn't cheaper. Foot soldiers are the people who do the dirty work. Foot soldiers are normally people with little or no authority. @Jabu Malinga I agree. How do you become a billionaire as a non-executive director? Only reason he was given directorships was to get inside line on government tenders. I read on IRR (Institute of Race Relations) site that CR was always late for meetings and always just voted with majority. @Jabu Malinga A billion is a huge number. To count to one billion at R1 per second 24 hours per day 365 days per year will take more than 36 years. Andile and Duduzane seem to have similar function. Didn't know one can get a phd from a technikon? @makhosi nobhatyi I sincerely hope they are not the same but we are all suspicious now. This man does sound well educated. @makhosi nobhatyi Let's hope so. CR is a lot more sophisticated than JZ so if he is crooked he'll hide it much better. He has been inspirational so far and I like what he says but why invisible before I'm waiting to see if CR has been hiding his backbone. I hope he has one. @kevindbn007 Won't happen. As long as people vote along racial lines our politics will be racist. @makhosi nobhatyi I hope so. If we get rid of the racial rhetoric then at least the white people can switch from defending themselves to assisting the people who currently claim to hate them. @david jacobs We have a murder rate of 52 per day. Which dead people are you talking about? @Cerebis Exactly. Number 1 responsibility of a government is to protect citizens from crime. We have lost almost as many people from crime as lost in the civil war in Syria where they are jets tanks helicopters... Was he in Dubai? PP needs to be questioned. He was being foot soldier...
Siegfried Molutsi,sound @SABC Digital News guy the sound is bad Really he cannot introduce himself 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 """yes""" idk what he is saying Boring Dr boring @Precious Ntshangase I hope that they are joining those dots. nope @Cerebis Agri/profession 😂😂😂😂 he got his PhD via CUT guys 😂😂😂😂😂😂 He did introduce himself where were you guys? 🤣😂😁😂😂 @Mrs Anderson fair enough so am I. @Mrs Anderson and he is not the only one who is under the hot seat 😂😂😂😂😂 @Koos Kwena well he is confused himself they are trying to figure what he said himself

makhosi nobhatyi,Khomba khomba Where is money coz diary is no more sir @ Mohamed Mia 😃😃😂😂 this guy must not come here to lied I think Ace Magashule is busy now combine evidence which will contradict witnesses "Ramaphosa was not getting involved "@Dominic Przybylski you may say so but fact is Andile has his own business company @Dominic Przybylski yes they are different but because he never discussed this to his father I think CR would stop him joining Bosasa if he was aware that he is looking for a contract "Andile will come to testify here too  "@Cerebis I won’t be disappointed what is happening now they are trying to push CR away from his position because he promised us for fighting corruption "@Dominic Przybylski I don’t think CR would be blinded by those who want to enrich themselves The back is out now "I said it before elections that we are voting for CR fate because we believe he was tackled our concerns otherwise if he was not there ANC would be not there now Crooks According to the law sir it was approved by you They caught him 😂😂😃😃😃 Nkandla saga He is in the corner
Mziwethu Ntombela,For me I don't care as long as this commission will come to the conclusion that all those who did wrong go to jail iam fine Is he really a doctor exactly because he doesn't seem to understand the simple question "I think he's lying somewhere "those two farmers that were there before him I am waiting for the day where Ace mahashule comes here together with Zwane but Ace won't finish his testimony just like his father somewhere he will also complain about something maybe there is nothing wrong but for now he's saying nothing our public protector mkhwebane did not find anything wrong with politician in her report how's that possible correct my brother I don't take her Sirious and I wish all her report to go to high court and loose them she must leave that office my Dr is still testifying I am waiting for the big guns come here regarding this matter that's all for today
Nonzy,So many directors... Yes Jabu. They were very hungry these guys and Thabo was slow. Guptas have been waiting in shadows since the beginning of time. They only came out of the closet during zumas reign. I really like the guy at the back. We will fall inlove with you Pastor. hahah Mrs Anderson He has a phd in physics "He sounds like he hangs out with Zwane. he should have stayed in academia Dr masipa "CR will backstab the life out of his comrades. He is devil incarnate "We area bit rough around the edges in SA thats a relief This guy Zondo has beautiful hands The pressure!
carnoth ngomane,@rohan barnard and that grammy came with few millions This witness knows it all but i doubt he will spill the beans "@Mzalwane Mzala you are correct The problem with lies is that you have to memorize everything but with the truth you just simply tell it like it is just like his master Ace will play dumb "@Samkelo Nxele i think it matters not how the question is asked

Khaya Nomoyi,Judges know a lot about authority and who has it or not. Estina made a proposal for the dairy farm without even having a cent in their bank account. What is confusing here instead of being clear as to how much Vrede got from this 140million. Its like these people were running a Supermarket with this money.They just approved a Gupta proposal to fund their wedding and give them free pass to land at waterkloof airbase.
lesego gareth,Maybe He is a Doctor like Doctor Khumalo

jeevan singh,that pretty advocate has a nice new hairstyle
Peter Sant,EFF members are useless like Malema.

Robert Russell,ANOTHER crooked directorate.... courtesy of the ANC
PHAPHAMA SCHOOL,Point of correction this guy is my homeboy from QwaQwa
Peet Venter,Milk cows only become profitable in year 4 unless you buy in high producing pregnant stock. @Jabu Malinga Without continued govt funding after donating the ground and infrastructure 20 beneficiaries would need at least 100 producing cows with a further 100 heifer followers. @Jabu Malinga The 100+100 is what èàch beneficiary would need to pool. To feed 20 families you would need 4000 cows in milk from day one if you exclude having to repay the ground and initial infrastructure. @Diss & Dad. you'll be surprized to learn how many milk cow's meat are eaten daily. @Diss & Dad A dead cow can't produce anything :-) @Diss & Dad I'm saying that dairy cows contribute towards food security through their meat once they are slaughtered. @Diss & Dad I followed your point but your arguement is not popular in Africa where meat is king. "@Diss & Dad. In Africa ""obesity"" is a sign of wealth."
roberto wilco,Jabu who would buy those businesses South Africa is uninvestable for foreign companies Would they take the debt too "Put all those companies in bankruptcy  I dont think foreign companies would put money into South Africa to much risk
The Eagle,paypal me /3fort Please donate me
Buti Mothoa,he was introduced by the hawks to the guptas🤔
Lorna Kavanagh,There are plenty of genuine dairy farmers in SA who could have advised the dept. The crying shame of this whole debacle is that this project could have been handled by SA dairy board. Yes Jabu .... but still a crying shame because the farmers lost out .😥
Raymond Raymond,this guy doesn't know anything. IT company on a dairy project. He was supposed to investigate all this things. He is lying to the commission
Phuti Herbert Manamela,Peet Venter please dude Point being????
KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"You're still here @I Am Free? and i can't believe this is still going on? Wow @I Am Free 25 year old? Wow!
