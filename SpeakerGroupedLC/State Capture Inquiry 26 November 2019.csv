Mzayifani Ntetha,"this commission is teaching us many things
Mkhatshwa Mpendulo,am learning a lot
bongile sango,morning guys in the room
Sam Monkoe,@Stronger together mo curry lol Lex did you get superman like we agreed ? Well done your payment is incoming. Pastor its a very rude word I am not sure if its Hindi or Urdu
Thulani Bukani,Molweni nonke
Pheladi Lamola,Yes he basically owed the Guptas. Well Zuma said they helped his and his family when no-one else would. So I think they had the upper hand Maybe that's why they say he's ill. No normal person can take the strain of what's being revealed in this commission and not be a little depressed. I'm with you @Bianca Arnold. I don't think I'll ever feel sorry for him. Breaks my heart to see that we have people like Maria amongst us. They refuse to see the wrongs that happened under Zuma and he let it. The one and only @Lex Luger Well Maite has a hole in the head so maybe Cwele felt he needed to fill the void😂 in a manner of speaking OK why is he drinking so much water all of a sudden? Is he perhaps emotional? Eish Someone is sabotaging the sound. "So Zuma lied to Nene. Well @Mthobisi Zuma you really need to start listening to everyone who comes to the commission with an open mind. In your eyes Zuma did nothing wrong and anyone who says otherwise is pushing an agenda. Yes Mo. What gives?
Elvis Malakoane,hello sir does Zuma watch this commission redriger that must be depressing I don't envy him at all things are falling apart on his side crystal meyer don't feel sorry at all he messed up big sekglolo they are playing in saxonworld collen maine very true goodbye Maria Maria lie is not a lie if you believe it in religious terms he is a satanist he also can't tell redriger knaters Ek kan afrikaans praat sonder enige help wim louw time is ripe mikey likesit that is rude yes mikey likesit did you have coffee this morning mikey likesit OK cheers! when economy is right Die man is vir jou dors they were going to poison him there I'm Canada Havard reminds me of lindiwe mazibuko can someone produce a horror movie of Zuma presidency but it must play at night when kids are asleep Zuma Ian paranoid person is a Mthobisi Zuma in the house! it's Duduzane yes he looked very nevours is Pastor j around somewhere!? pastor j nice seeing you are around my brother is on friday mbuso sorry iwated to give date but send too early but u got it now Anne M have you been here since morning? he makes a baby you are right he is making a lot of sense that what was done by ballpottenger sekgolo amen to that I always wonder who will be president after President Ramaphosa after say 9yrs redriger because ANC has scares resources when it comes to ethical leadership now redriger But there is a solution if south Africans black and white can stop fighting over small things and focus imagine if Ace Magashule group takes over again Zimbabwe will be Sunday school picnic imagine if Ace Magashule group takes over again Zimbabwe will be Sunday school picnic win louw in his dreams wim louw don't you want to take early lunch and come back fresh later please wim louw I hear you

Eugene,"Hello mense Sekgololo jy weet Zuma gan nie tronk toe nie. "Is dit okay as ek n biekie Afrikaans praat? As jy daarvan hou nie se ""nee""" Ek sukkel so bietjie met my Afrikaans. Elke keer as ek iets in tik dan wil ek engelse woorde gebruik want ek ken nie al die Afrikaanse worde nie "Nee ek moet Afrikaans praat want my naam is Toffie en toffie is die Afrikaanse woord vir ""Toffee"" so dit maak net sin as ek Afrikaans praat." Ek het darem n Afrikaanse sleutelbord om my te help met die spell check Ek spell Ramaphosa as Ramapoesja maak dit sin?

Ania Teo,I trust this guy as much as I trust his brothers. because my brother lives there now canada As soon as the majority of the people realise that the ANC is corrupt and that they can't even run a political party let alone a country. Then we can move forward as a nation without the ANC Brendan. unfortunately we vote along race and not performace in this country
