Can hear the Police they coming for Ace Watson first he can inform whining ANCWL was pulling the strings Ndlovo they on Bloomberg and you can check them. they have clean audit for many years and not the same audit done on Stienhoff and SOEs U where does his name come up on the Enquiry. where did he deal with Guptas. you just trying to divert attention. keep the chat clean and focus on the subject. non racial comments. use respect "Pillay and other I have send the warning any more bad comments and he is gone. I timed out Goat and he came back and continued. I have blocked people from all walks of life. I never ever said I was clever wena. all want is a clean good chat without insulting and racial comments. talk about what this gentleman is talking about. "referring to Blacks David. focus on the enquiry. it's not a party promotion Chat. elections are over How is that racist please explain Goat I have no view on a group like that. give me a name of someone and I will tell you what I feel. I have no issue with any group. some comments are completely of chart and have nothing to do with the enquiry so I ask for a vote. is GOAT comments racial against on group and he should be blocked. it's a democracy wrong David it is everyone's business and some comments are very bad. David throught out the world people use others. it's up to the people been used to change that. Ryan is a returning trouble maker already blocked on my list so I cant see his comments please just block him Davis how is that not racist I dont see the person Ryan because I blocked him long time ago. so I dont see any of his comments Goat why not just keep the chat nice clean and friendly then there is no harm agreed David. Davies no it will not I worked in many countries. and things can change. it takes hard work but they can get better true words Goat Ryan is a EFF supporter that is causing devide. just block the person Goat and his overused RACE Card is getting boaring My Lady I think each day the enquiry should have a good looking lady because it changes the chat and all racial comments go. Socks criminals of all race stole. not just one group. the breaking down of Law and order by the Zuma government let the criminals move in. Socks I am South African born in Joburg and I see myself as an African not white/pink or what ever. not matter what others say.

If they are guilty then arrest and prosecute. Your whataboutism is unwarranted here. Well said Ro Pi. We in the UK are taking ourselves out of EU corruption and capture.

Mzalwane Mzala,This is educational if you care to listen. How did the ANC give Rupert and Openheimer your wealth in 1994 @Minoctar Sithole ? Land @Minoctar Sithole So our land was given as a gift in 1994 to these people? So premier Ace Magashule got it wrong? According to @Minoctar Sithole there were no wars of conquest in South Africa to disposes black people of land. All that happened was that the ANC as late as 1994 gave away the land. @Dominic Przybylski I missed the differentiation. Thanks.
Kercy Pillay,goat dont act like one hey we are carrying u tee dont worry about hime he reminds me of BILLY thanks thando u are a star i]two wrongs do not make a right SO lets stand together as one nation thanks white africa .. the same goes for me and thousands of south african indians "well you dont have to be offended because i did not intend any offence  i dont thom nk ot shoild it people like you who get offended why should i withdraw it is my statement your it is sad that you suddenly want to be likea boss when u say things that nopenly insult other race groups it is not offensive thanks michael i apologise for deviation now i am forced to say silly goat

Pasturised milk gets boiled before it gets drunk. Unpasturised is natural straight from the cow. @Mzalwane Mzala .
