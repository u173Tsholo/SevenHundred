Just go and play outside guys Chair took over the questioning somma "@Nick 😶😶😶 Kate deals with Aviation matters. @Louis C 🤣🤣🤣 "Lord 🙏🙏🙏 #Sanfran exactly!! shouldve brought an interpreter for this witness so he could express himself even more
Damon Radebe,"Just imagine there was something like this in USA "irregularities on any operations "but going on a reviewing all operations of government is wrong and unlawful
Heather Durr,@Damon Radebe I am a staunch anti-Trumper and GOP hater but the democrats have their fair share of dark secrets. Politics is all about money and lies and secret undercover ops "@Damon Radebe it would never happen as everyone is involved.They had enquiries into the Clintons @Willie Makena Poor Thuli-I wonder if she listened yesterday Why is the SABC in front of parliament. Hope all 'Honourables' dont mess with our state capture feed The dentists compressor broke down so they cant fix my tooth and I now have tablets. So not impressed. Who is the cute evidence leader and is Bester a skelm @Paul Buchel Myburgh is having a trial run with the sexy Adv Hofmeyer I think Euuuw Exclusitivity nooooooo such word exists @Jenny Whitewaves One is pregnant and the other is in prison @Pastor J.J How come you never call me Dearest I am also trying to understand @John Batwell Yup-he Myburgh is there in the gallery I recognised the ears
Willie Makena,Sorry Thuli no amnesty
Fred Desrosiers,All politics dirty. I found out when my brother ran for public office that the people who make it to the top are all connected thru favors. Rarely is an honest person able to get to public office. Big mistake to ask Mr. Ready to talk to Sighn. It is like asking the wolf for candy. Was Melrose Arch the headquarters of people doing dubious things. Salim Essa again? He seems to be in everything.
Maxwell Sibiya,Who are we expecting as the witness today?

They have to build a new furnace overtime that happens "I am not asking you this "@Aubrey De Bliquy smelters are one industry that needs a constant supply. Once the power goes off and the ore solidifies @Aubrey De Bliquy your point makes it impossible for smelters to survive in SA.

Cerebis,Adv Myburgh is in a hurry today. "@Nolan aka BlazerMax18 Many people do not pay their license fees. Taxpayers Bailouts have kept SABC alive @madzi Kuse Was he not appointed after that as an Ambassador somewhere? I am waiting for the Zuma cabal and the Malema cabal bank statements. Fun and games on the way guys? Let go of the balls guys? ANC Government was forced to set up this Commission by the Courts and Thuli. Zuma wanted to put his own corrupt Judge in place and was stopped. ANC is accused No 1 led by ex No 1 Zuma. @Mfanafuthi Gama I agree that they were and still are the Government. The ANC tried their level best to sink this commission under Zuma. @Lebohang Mofokeng 100% Agree with you. @Cooler Cat Totally agree! "@14nateg I have no land "@14nateg Hehehe "@14nateg As a Taxpayer myself EFF people are now attacking the Zondo Commission while hiding their Bank accounts. It will not work! South Africans are onto you guys and want the crooks in jail. "@Some guy OK Carlton Centre....now days they all go to Melrose Arch? Singh W Singh was stewing them in Gupta Curry All the Transnet and Eskom corrupt names are coming out here! Anoj Singh will not do well in jail. @Lona Devu Malema does speak a lot of crap. He goes to a court case about alleged farm murderers and announces that there are no farm murders in SA. Has he and the President have the same view? Looks like Melrose Arch was the local meeting place of the Gupta State Capture Thugs? Murder in our Constitution? There is no mention of murder in our Constitution....Eish Man. Murder in SA is a major issue in SA. we murder about 50 citizens every day on average. Sad hey? "@Njabulo Mlangeni ""We Don't Have ""Farm Murder"" In Our Constitution: I was reacting to that statement of yours." Come on 8th December. I am tired of this corruption!

Aubrey De Bliquy,Why can't we get more of these smart black people in positions of government service? Why all the dodos. It is not as if there is a shortage from what I have seen. Chair being friendly. Surely it is more beneficial and economic to refine the manganese at source which reduces the freight volume to a fraction? Is it a question of every job looks like a nail if all you have is a hammer? @SanFran Arnold We don't have electricity to smelt/ What do trains run on? free energy? "Then we need more electricity That is circular logic @SanFran Arnold @SanFran Arnold Circular logic again. The same applies to a host of industrry. You argue as if smelting is the only industry that cannot deal with load shedding. I have plastic injection moulding customerss for whom load shedding is devastating. the plastic dries in the mould and it is a massive time consuming clean up operation. @SanFran Arnold All that may be true without it detracting from my point. The manganese is going to ultimately be smelted. Avoiding solving the problem does not detract from my point. @SanFran Arnold You make no sense. i am advocating for solving the real problem in favour of smelting and the best economic interests of South Africa. I have no dog in this fight. What's yours? Prescribing sub-contractors is so obviously improper. Why don't they see that? Zondo is professional and meticulous. @Natalie Soine Zondo politely guided the advocate to avoid leading questions which undermine the legal process of impartiality. @Jenny Whitewaves Did you notice everyone falling over one another to embrace the odious Hilary Clinton in 2016 but nobody seems to notice Tulsi Gabbard because she is not corruptible? @Tommygun Wimpy screams frugality and balance. @Jenny Whitewaves True the worlds leading banana republic USA. @Tommygun Your sarcasm didn't go over my head. LOL @a b c I am more concerned about the trillions of dark dollars the Pentagon spends on mischief around the world. I would not expect them to be absent from these open media. @Lennox Rashopola They would need to change the constitution. Not likely. "@12 40 Yes @Walter Zikalala exactly
