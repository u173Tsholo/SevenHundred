Paul Buchel,@Slindile Ngcobo​😎😂😂 "@Derek Main​ "This is ridiculous now "@Derek Main​ "Correct "@Mbuso Ndlovu​
Nkosinathi ngidi,thanks Jonny yebo what does this mean?
Derek Main,Morning all @Eliot Chauke You sound worried. @Paul Buchel Well hopefully we don't cross swords. 😁 "@Concerned South African Dudu Myeni has always shown the law the middle finger. If you or I had done the same "@Concerned South African Since the law is no longer serving us @Paul Buchel That's what I'm talking about - we're on our own and need to deal with our own issues. Our government is unable or simply doesn't care to administer justice fairly or competently. @Paul Buchel Criminals are running amok in the vacuum. @Person of interest ...and making sure it's bolted down. @Paul Buchel The cops ARE the criminals. @bongile sango Yes - the cops now are as bad as they were during apartheid. It's difficult for law-abiding citizens to know who to fear more - the criminals or the cops. They should fetch Dudu Myeni from her house and drive her up to her court case in the back of a police van. @Eliot Chauke Eish! You love all the criminals. You must be ANC.
