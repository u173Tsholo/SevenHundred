Slindile Ngcobo,hi all @Melor Hadebe ...her name is Refiloe Molefe "@goolamv ...look in the mirror and say
Saba Sizwe,happy morning's people of joke Republic of South Africa now still in bad 🤣🤣 off work 315 I think Majavu planned his speech well hence TheMzolo says Advocate kabelo you correct people who just do what they wish to do must answer for their doings should the chair dismiss ?? Agrizi must come forward Mr Majavu has convinced the chair to cross examine Agrizzi 1k people Abe it's Majavu round of applause for Mr Majavu 👏👏👏👏
Melor Hadebe,im here for the lady 😍😍😍 Thank you @Slindile Ngcobo
Esther Vetuu Katjiuongua-Kamberipa,"Eish Msansi that is what real democracy is🤔 "Who is this she @ Ann M. Thank you 🙏 "I suppose a snake🐍 not in the actual sense "@ Kabelo Katjedi
Kabelo Katjedi,or tested "im here to Zola Majavu which one Cant recall the name bt will check 4 u Thanx Robert "I nvr trusted the Agrizzi guy "Saba this Agrizzi guy nvr said anything in regard 2 his involvement as office bearer of Bosasa "I suspected that something myt be wrong the day he publicly agreed that he is racist "I have been following his process since he ws appointed psl prosecutor Singi yep from my side its sharp "Every council will be defending his or her client Esther im just worried abt the manner in which Zondo allows this councils trying 2 channel him on what 2 do.Some might feel that their client shouldn't b cross examined even though he must force them2 "once you force them to give evidence u myt come across the answers like i do not recall
Barry Sila,Refiloe Molefe is her name "Majavu seems like a top attorney
TheMzolo,I remember this guy from my Glen Thomas days.. @Saba SIizwe...What do you mean by advocate? Indeed Witsie..🙏🏾…
Robert Russell,her name is Adv Refiloe Molefe Zuma is the king of the stooges @Spykerhond ... I agree with you that if the 25k viewrs are representative of the the electorate then 57% of them are criminals as they voted for the ANC and are accomplices to the ANC's looting She is always poorly prepared
Mzalwane Mzala,I said it a long time ago that Agrizzi only told gossip on Jiba and Mrwebi. Ms Jiba has been referred to as Snake based on Agrizzi's hearsay testimony. Everyone has got rights @jasper dougal You boast about your rights but take insist on Jiba's rights to be ignored. Jiba only went to one commission. We all have rights post-apartheid @Khulubuse Z The self-righteousness of some people irritate me. They are racist. We can agree that corruption is wrong but we will not be fans of racists. "Hi @Andrew Mboweni  The Chair appoints his legal team. It has nothing to do with the state or ANC. "Racists are crazy. The chair was appointed by the Chief Justice
Kay Kay,Majavu is a heavy weight of the legal fraternity Majavu knows his story This guy knows his story "@Barry Silla He's so calm and collected with no emotions like Muzi Skhakane who wanted to like cry every now and then. Majavu has since been Jiba's savior and he continues to do so viva Majavu "PP and CR court battles I will not use the word hijack but Mr. Radebe was correct. 😂😂
fikile mbokodi,what is the argument here guys is this lawyer wants to cross examine agrizzy?
makhosi nobhatyi,Jiba will go down she never prostitute There will be no more state capture after this one I promise Jiba must face the law how can not see Guptas steals money "We all need each other Miss Buthelezi is too soft and shyness to ask constructive questions I hope today she will rise up to the game @African refugees please don’t spread your own opinion CR17 received money from people whom was concerned and wanted the best for the country which they believe with the candidates msg was clear "@ African refugees I understand clearly about your concerns which is everyone concerned not to repeat same thing Zuma did but here it clearly not the same @Moshoeu Mabusela exactly that is my point CR17 clearly he facing Zuma coz we have seen his representatives opposing Gordhan appealed so it was clear that he is fighting back no doubt "@ Concerned South African he already started he come here to lied by accusations of his own people who was appointed by himself saying they were spying "Fight back is already started PG did warn us back two years ago "I stated very clearly before that i am not interested with politics but I look at the problem "Pp is entertaining those people whom make accusations and do as they please "@ Ann M. I think that was a plan of Zuma and Gavin Watson to get CR17 on the muddy so that confusing him in fighting corruption "@Sthakathi khumalo PG stole no money sir so no serious crime @Sthakathi Khumalo that why PG approach courts to resolve this matter to rest we are witness We saw hawks wanting to arrest PG before prior to this allegation he rebuked and they scared to carryover We are not saying people must not face the law but state institutions must not be the tool to fight political battles which is we have seen happening before and now "@Moshoeu Mabusela it a pain sir I believe their leadership things will change give them space to fix the company @Sthakathi Khumalo This mess we are in now is for past 9 years ago so you can’t expect changes at 16 months the executive board joined these entities give them benefits of doubt surely you will get something "We can put these competent people on the position but inside there are still those who was used to do dirty tricks "The big guns hidden between the law
SA Fitness,the day has come for state capture is he a snake??? the sound is not centered the sound is not okay EFF Will never fall the tell the truth to power "the funny thing is that the people who follow anc know about corruption that take place but they still vote for that because they want free champagnes but the truth is that we need transformation in our country we dont have development cant wait for the parliament to open there will be questions to the president but the truth is that we need transformation in our country we dont have development YES THEY HAVENT FIXED IT
Jabu Nhlanhla,czwe this man is the future musa don't generalized abt Zulu's
Mbuso Ndlovu,why is aggrrizzi running away now?????? THIS GUY IS NOT SCARED OF ZONDO @ Anne True WHO IS A FOOL????? CR 17 SHOULD ADDRESS THE STATE OF CORRUPTION ADDRESS @ Ibo Why Cyril is hiding his funders
Abe Molefe,today witness guys? Anne M thank you will be like zim soon cause no 1 payback looted money or sentenced we are on Estina dairy farm hearing there is no focus on coutry or citizen cause their busy with courts on other hand citizen must pay tax
Nonzy,This guy sounds sharp.
Anne M.,"@Abe Molefe Witness today is former Phumelela Municipal Manager "Adv Majavu is not a witness @thandeka precious The current PP is investigating CR17 @Esther Katjiuongua-Kamberipa Adv Majavu represents Adv Jiba who was named by Agrizzi as having received bribes @Esther Katjiuongua-Kamberipa 👍 "@Max Muskat I have sound @jasper dougal Then you haven't been watching much of this commission. @rohan barnard Adv Majavu (representing Jiba) appeared before this witness and the cross examination has been postponed until other witnesses have given evidence. @Moshoeu Mabusela I agree @makhosi nobhatyi I think the leak of the Bosasa donation to the DA was done to deliberately by Bosasa. "@Moshoeu Mabusela NDPP Batohi is busy cleaning house at the NPA. In the meantime "@Smart Guys Not voluntarily I live in hope @Moshoeu Mabusela I read it in a news report. I'll look for the link. "@Siziwe Khalatha Former Phumelela Municipal Manager 👍

danie schoeman,This inquiry is a mockery will continue till 2030
rohan barnard,what time are we resuming? thank you @Smart Guys Zondo never keeps time Morning @Sofia Sofia ! How are you doing friend? @Sofia Sofia 😂😂😂😂 Bold and the Beautiful aka Zondo and The Corrupt 😂😂😂 Zondo had to take a break from Agrizzi... @Sofia Sofia I read it on twitter that he was / still is going to be cross-examined today @Sofia Sofia could be.... But i'm pretty sure they said on twitter that it was today. Maybe I misread lol @Sofia Sofia this is me running to twitter. I know Jiba wanted to cross examine Agrizzi. @Sofia Sofia according to Jacarandafm Nomgcobo Jiba applied to cross-examine Angelo Agrizzi @Sofia Sofia #statecaptureinquiry on twitter Thank you @Anne M.
Smart Guys,any time now Rohan Zondo said 10min break it's now 20 minutes let me put it on record the Guptas will never return to South Africa Anne that will never happen Anne that's why they went to Dubai and not India 1 year holiday this country is where it is because of Zuma and his cronies big TSOTSIES Zuma Must go to jail all state officials involved in corruption Must be sent to prison
jasper dougal,Would like for someone to tell Mr Majav to F...k Off ! He and Jiba disgusting human beings "Well I may talk nonsense  "This Commission is a complete waste of time  "If Jiba had taken as much time to do her job correctly as she spends in Court or Commissions  Yes and that was one too many ! Zondo only has one speed "Can people just get over apartheid  "I don’t understand why people have a problem that amounts to a different ratio of melanin under the skin  This is a farce and now they are sticking the middle finger at us I have yet to see the evidence leaders with anything near Advocate Wim Trengove’s ability. Looks like the State reluctant to bring any Big Guns to the table "SABC’S recording especially the sound is generally atrocious Advocate Pretorius made a shocking job with Zums "I wonder what criteria the Commission used to establish if their evidence leaders are sufficiently experienced to do the job  "I wonder when Mr Zums is going to grace the Commission with a reappearance I fail to understand why the Hawks or NPA have not even opened any dockets yet on people who have been found ‘wanting so-to- speak’ what are they waiting for? This is all smoke and mirrors "Why do Courts in ZA still use paper in the form of files and affidavits etc  "When a person tries to overcome due process

Thanks hun you always seem to know these things 😃 @African Refugee this one looks like Willie Wallie Bookworm !

So far CR17 was fund by this or that but not yet caught leasing this or that to this or that funder "@African Refugee We never had a firmed officially publicly said version @African Refugee and in the end a conclusion will be hand over by Zondo to the Gov and then the law would be expect to step in.2/2 "@African Refugee Why you are so negative @African Refugee Why is whitewash? Why is not you and your ilk trying to disrupt the inquiry for a hideous agenda? @African Refugee Do you KNOW the mean the academically mean state capture?

Kevin Simon,There we have it URGENCY again!!!!! Link to EISH!!!! Bring it on!! More please. Zuma can't afford NOT to fight back. This is the end-game for him. Fightback is intense. Bad for our reputation. Just see the flight of foreign capital from our shores. Tough times ahead....
