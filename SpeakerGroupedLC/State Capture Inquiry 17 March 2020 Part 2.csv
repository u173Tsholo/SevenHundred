They vote for them because they do not and will never trust the white man after what they did to them So better the devil you know. "@Ricus Ellis im afraid so @Steve Roos this is South Africa and not somalia malnutrition is not that big here. I have a feeling that some people are hoping that this virus does some damage but once again this is Africa we probably have been exposed to far worse without even knowing. Africans are going to cough this off just watchüòÇ Bru the Chinese government is the epitome of dodgy "They did not want the world to find out "Oh the virus is going to infect everyone in our country including you reading this "@Nomonde Gubevu even now these measures are not enough @Dylan Davenport You think those chinese are going to stop eating bats? @Paul Buchel We humans are the real virus on this Earth If the world Banks collapse because of this virus then we all doomed. How long can we keep entire countries on lockdown without affecting the economy? @Steve Roos watch people fight for what they need. Its heading that way already @Keith Din @Keith Din im not scared im just prepared for worst case scenario thats all Lets just hope it wont come to that. I think this virus was designed to get rid of the old and weak of the population. "@Steve Roos I was really hoping for a Zombie apocalypse man You two Steve take care man.

Keith Din,This government of ours acted only after the U.S. has pronounced the prohibition of the worst affected nations. Its like the ANC Gov was waiting for the lunatic called Trump to act first. Yeeer @Nomonde Gubevu Why ucinga uzokuba ne heart attack? lol Is she being grilled?

Who knows it was a plan to thwart or hinder the Chinese from protesting? @Steve Roos Farmers are key @Steve Roos .... we can't live without them I know some of us here have skills to write sci fi movies and novels.....BUT Lets STOP talking conspiracy theories.
Steve Roos,Outside the world? Countries like Russia and China are already at the door and are inside gaining from our demise Try finance that the players know South Africa can never be payed back State debt Needed Past lol South Africa does not belong to its people rather the ANC has already sold it off bit by bit Now all left is for China to come and colonise the land once state capture is done Why vote for them Kieth I‚Äôm in the UK So glad to be here even with this virus Keith the world has it Think about South Africa and how it will spread Taxi or township I guarantee you there are thousands in SA with it They just don‚Äôt test like europe Charlotte lol 60 is not the figure by far Talk to me in 30 day‚Äôs from now "At least once the virus has taken hold Again I disagree Nande how many people are malnourished and living close to the masses?

The young nation that won‚Äôt be badly affected David Keith Dim you still talking Dim How many people per medical professional are there Malnutrition is a problem in South Africa. I didn‚Äôt say starvation We have 1.5 per thousand Bev 100% Keith you love to engage I see Nande just look at the rest of the world and you will know I hope it doesn‚Äôt but know otherwise Dim And the east That they not even showing the world China are dodgey This is as worse as it gets They say you can contract it more than once and the second time normally kills Keith I‚Äôm proud of you China is the definition of dodgey I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they didn‚Äôt engineer this virus Keith my kids are here to stay but I do visit my country at least once a year You are only starting your winter And wash your hands Rise and do what? Do right But how does one convince the rest of the world First two commandments Agreed Exports and imports will get worse Find companies that can produce some parts locally Keith Leather was always used in the past Keith world economy is about to collapse and everything will be super expensive Welcome to the future ‚úåüèº And when there is nothing left people will kill each other We need to learn from farmers and not chase them away Keith they made it and it excaped from there labs before they could contain it We really need to start kissing the farmers They produce food Conspiracy becomes really. Sad there are no Zombies üòÇ Always wanted to kill a zombie Corona Zombi rising Jokes aside best of luck with the future and stay safe if you can. Don‚Äôt kiss the farmers
Nomonde Gubevu,"Can the person typing these subtitles please pay attention. What nonsense are you typing this woman is going to have a heart attack after this @keith she's braver than most. This is a lot of whistle blowing ... PAID IN CASH At this point I'm sure she's also scared for her life. I hope these thugs don't start intimidating her. She's so honest @keith you are so blind and naive sssssshhhhhhh. just ssssshhhhhh @Nande another naive one hehehehehe @Keith shhhhhhhhh @Keith which South Africa are you living in? the one with wifi and water right? There are so many REAL ISSUES we're facing as a country on a daily. As INFORMED as you are you should know that. @Keith Start in Kilptown. Our government should have never waited this long to start taking control of the corona virus. They knew about this months ago @Keith We do not have enough testing station so there's no way of really determining how many people have actually already been in contact with the virus without even knowing. @Keith There could be people who are currently infected by the virus but do not know. It's about R1400 cash just to get screened. how many people do not have access to that kind of money as is. No @Keith I'm here to fill your empty head with some sense
