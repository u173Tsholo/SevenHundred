Anne M.,@makhosi nobhatyi Really? Thanks @makhosi nobhatyi . I'll go and have a look. @Antoinette Rader The commission has a website with all the previous testimony etc. @Mandy Pannack It might be because of the audio recording they're trying to play.

Emon Arefin,"👁👀 After Donald J Trump
Born free,"hi I am a patriot of President Trump. Victory will be his 2020. Trump is his own man working for the American people not the lobbyists and donors. He is right on track. It's a pity this government has never been able to to create 6million jobs in 25 years as Trump has done in just under 3 years. This government has destroyed jobs more unemployment day after day. @I am free.. no I have not heard but am interested please explain more. Yes Rob. Party corruption before country Anne are you denying me my rights to freedom of speech? I am simply relying to someone on this chat. You don't have to read it. Anne as I said.. don't comment on my comments you don't have want to read them. Who are you to tell me what not to comment on 😠 I am Free. Not sure who or what you are relating to. The serpent being advocate Jiba..I presume. Got it. 👍 Mr Nxasana was paid R17 million to step down . Zuma misspent so much of taxpayers money. It is the taxpayer and people who pay government service providers that have to keep on bailing this government out. Next time They must cuff Zuma to his chair. Yes sad but true. No-one has any confidence in SA anymore.
