GM @Canis Africanis "@Ralph Petersen Yes this party political capture is the foundation of state capture. Our elected repreentative must be free to jump parties @zip reeper 2 December I have to be in court for answering a phone while driving which may have been income to feed my family. Law has become a profit parasite. @Joseph Mohale Our governments wont be able to steal from us when we elect governments who refuse to pay for criminal acts of previous governments like the Apartheid government too. @zip reeper It's there tough luck. I can't pay. They will have to lock me up and reposess my children. You can't get blood out of a stone. "I love this guy's acrylic mask in the background. There is no scientific proof masks are better for overall inection rates and health. It's medieval superstition "@zip reeper We are gullible. Bernays "@Michael Lawrence Obviously you are dictated by authority not sciece and your own intellect That way you don't have to actually think. Just do as you are told. @zip reeper Except I don't see any evidence of a plague. Just propaganda & manipulation which gives us banana republic style elections in USA and a gullible world following the decree of WHO? When's lunch I need to get shopping and dont want to miss anything @Michael Lawrence Its a scam. Full of statistical anomalies ad political pressures and intrigues. It does not even rise to the level of a bad flu season. Mark my words and watch the anual stats. Back from shopping. BTW 900g Strawberry Jam is R26 at Giant Hyper if anyone loves jam. @Tommygun I know but 1kg Peanut butter is R50 and thats a bit much for my budget right now. @Tommygun Have to count pennies to survive. Life is great. 😀 Just give me hals a million and I'll solve the riddle of the plasma turbine based on the nature of his enchanted dust. "Our only consolation about being a banana republic is USA beat us there I am curious about date cutoffs like 1913 always in agreements about sovereignty of South Africans. What's with 1913? @Louise Roderick Yes is there a correlation between ANC 1912 and Land Act 1913? Neither are binding on a free people 100 years later. imo @Jude Jackson You ailed it. @Mzalwane Mzala Either way we need to assert as SOuth Africans that everyone has the right rent free to a piece of land on which to provide shelter for our families. @Mzalwane Mzala I suspect most South African agree unless we are beneficiaries of this obscene property rights regime which leaves South Africans poor and powerless in their own country. @Alex Mlangeni They only get away with stealing from us all while we allow them to divide us on false racial enmities. We swim r sink together. I disagree with the rhetoric based on ANti ANC. It does not help without an alternative. @SanFran Arnold Who do you propose to vote for? Our system is locked into parties we elect who then become the ruling elite nominating legislators who are rubber stamps Our system is set up to select one oligarchy or another.

Mzalwane Mzala,@ronald grossi :thanksdoc: Beside membership fees all parties are either funded trough private donations or by the public (tax payers). ANC Greater Johannesburg is no exception. @Pheladi Lamola What has the sitting mayor of Johannesburg done wrongly? It is corruption when these amounts are kickbacks for tenders. @Pheladi Lamola He is coming to the commission and so far it sounds as if he was fundraising as regional treasurer. State capture: Zizi Kodwa fingered for multiple 'suspicious' payments . He was never a treasurer and it is reasonable to suspect it was for his personal benefit. @Gugulethu Xhosans Whose companies? @Sabelo Nxumalo I did not know that @Gugulethu Xhosans That's a fair question @Freddie Van Rhyn You only vote for parties or people who avail themselves to contest elections. Please avail yourself because Zondo & Madonsela are no contesting @Sabelo Nxumalo That claim comes from the Independent and Dr. Pandor has demanded that they withdraw it. Still investigating @Sabelo Nxumalo Vote for them @Freddie Van Rhyn @Freddie Van Rhyn I will not vote for them. I respect your choice but their policies do not serve my interests. @Freddie Van Rhyn How long was Ramaphosa a deputy to Zuma? @Anwar Syed people like @Freddie Van Rhyn assume that Ramaphosa was a deputy throughout Jacob Zuma's presidency and that is not true. @bruinman Uyabuthetha ububhanxa kodwa @bruinman Ingathi uqaqadekile kodwa. @Aubrey De Bliquy Possibly the coming into effect of the 1913 Land Act I agree @Aubrey De Bliquy

kgopa elija,the truth has long been out. here is only the waste of Tax payers money. ANC is openly implicated here. "ANC in the Greater Johannesburg have been accusing the leadership of other political party needless to say why their former President does not want to appear to the commission. "The President is the only one to take final decisions. Even if Ramaphosa should have advised 
Philly Moropa,the anc as an organization has perfected the art of stealing radical economic transformation at work factions in the anc is just a group of thieves fighting over the loot nothing to do with running the country argument that the is no alternative is just an excuse for voting same corrupt organization into power and keep on complaining thereafter

What have they actually done for you? @TRUE ISLAMIC FACT You really think you're going to get beaten by whites if you go to the park. Give me a break. You cant give any valid reasons it seems @Jude Jackson yup. No hope "Was hoping for a logical discussion
Freddie Van Rhyn,yes give me a streetwise and free t shirt and I wil vote for you if ANC gets voted out then perhaps they will start getting rid of all their corrupt officials and clean out their organazation vote for a independent person as president that is honorable and can put a government together. someone like DCJ. ZONDO or Thuli madonzela vote for the ACDP I believe they are honourable mzalwane mzala I will vote for them in. ext general elections Ramaphosa was deputy president under Zuma. what did he do to put things right then he just allowed things to carry on. Now he wants to clean out.To late if Rhamaphosa saw things were not right he should have done the honorable thing and resigned he was deputy for 5 years no I know Rhamaphosa was deputy for 5 years True then don't cry if you don't get service from them. ANC IS CORRUPT THROUGH AND THROUGH. EFF wil make this country into another Zimbabwe ANC will pull a Mugabe in next general election
