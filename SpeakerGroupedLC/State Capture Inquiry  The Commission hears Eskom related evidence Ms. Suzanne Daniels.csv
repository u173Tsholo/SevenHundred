Barbara Sattler,you must be joking which land?
Martha Sello,Minister Ronald Lamola for President hi Diane what is she doing overseas? ran away üòÇ @Celeste I think he's the only one who is still honorable so far! @Lerato that exactly my point what is she doing overseas? "if I remember the Guptas wanted to question Mcebisi Jonas but didn't want to appear to give evidence how come butternut head didn‚Äôt fight for economy when he was the State President he wants to fight now? "its really mind boggling that the are people who think Zuma is innocent Molefe is coming back and Ramaphosa is coming to appear why the other one must be treated differently @Andre that's the reason NDZ was supposed to replace butternut head so that they can complete looting whatever is still left of this Country NDZ was to complete the mission! That's the reason Ramaphosa is not acceptable to Zuma supporters. @Ndumie how is he going after Zuma cos this commission was set up by Zuma himself and Madonsela? @Louis Advovo is going for the killer with the email trail even dcj was getting lost üòÇ @Lerato but dcj is waisting time he got lost on the email trails @Lerato agree dcj is enjoying it those are serious allegations that needs to be reported to the police for the fact that you are scared to name the judge yourself on this platform that says a lot so UK/USA and West used the Guptas in Saxonwold to capture our state? @Heather what do you expect from Judge Hlophe? Shoo @Lerato it reminds me of one anc member who said they will defend butternut head ka dibono! @Lerato today she drive around with Aston Martin at the expense of the poor they claim to represent cheers Lerato

Sal SA,@Diane hi Ms Daniels must explain why it was preferable to issue a guarantee Who from outside requested the guarantee??? "@Anne. yes i think the issue should be who the ultimate beneficiary was Also was the said beneficiary approved in the Board resolution @Don Su. This evidence is vital because it shows how executives in Eskom followed through on Zuma's objective of benefitting the Gupta's Ms Daniels is out of the discourse @Ndumie. Did African Bank receive a bail out? @Ndumie. Bailouts are an international practice if in the public interest especially loss of jobs Why didn't they specify the name of the proposed owner in the resolution "@Brightwell. Even so "@Brightwell. No sir @Brightwell. These are legal issues and have to be very clear. Now we sitting with a problem because people don't think its important/legalistic! @Brightwell.
