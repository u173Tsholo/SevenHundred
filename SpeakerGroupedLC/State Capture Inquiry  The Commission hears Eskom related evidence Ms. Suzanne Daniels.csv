Ndumie Ndlovu,Andile Lungisa future President 🤪 Aaaaaceeee!!! Aaaaaaceee!!! Aaaacee!! "honestly speaking I'm disappointed in Zondo Awuuu Zondo refused the Guptas to testify via link from overseas but Daniels is allowed🤔🤐 @Akhonamandla Gala no tell me if he didn't deny Guptas the opportunity to testify? Guptas are at the centre of this commission but Mis Daniels is allowed to testify all the way from overseas 👿 @Tommygun yes they did ask to testify and Zondo refused because they were not in SA but look what is happening today @styx Ndlovo angazi ukhuluma ngani bhuti @Akhonamandla Gala no I'm not supporting the Guptas but I'm waking those who say Zondo is not bias @Arthur Mashingo no thank you.. your Ship is slowly sinking @Arthur Mashingo what's the difference then and now? @Lalitha C because miss Daniels is allowed to testify whilst overseas but the Guptas were denied that opportunity @stix Mtolo naaah I hate people who pretend to be Holly Holly and painting others as corrupt but they themselves are more evil than what they portray @Arthur Mashigo awwuuu she was here last month @melds melds I'm discussing the fact that she's in overseas that's evidence p @Akhonamandla Gala I don't hate him.. I just want consistency @Martha Sello both to testify via Zoom and cross-examine that snitch Jonas @akhonamandla gala facts like? that CODESA killed our true leader because they couldn't corrupt him like the rest... Chris Hani whilst we busy with state capture they are using our money preparing to live in MARS they've already landed there @martha Sello he did and today you calling it state capture @Anne M. the WMC was being slowly sidelined hence we have this now @Anne M. ABSA took that money given by De Klerk you seemed fine about it @Sal SA all of them must pay... what we are against is this selective justice "@Martha Sello we don't have a prblm with Ramaphosa white ppl fired live rounds in court burned the police cars and he did nothing about it.. you were all quiet bout it bt they attacked EFF for simply walking in Capetown Zuma didn't come to this commission and you say he must be arrested but he didn't storm the court with guns but I guess it white privilege "@Dee Bee selective justice is what we are against black Gogos @Dee Bee it is our black leaders are being Lynched here and humiliated they wasting time why we treat allegations as guilty verdict Angel with Horns🤔 miss Daniels where are your friends now @Martha Sello do you really think the current president had nothing to do with all these things that are happening BEE was meant to politely correct all evils @Aubrey @martha Sello I'm talking about court cases.. have you heard or saw Ramaphosa in this state capture or anyone from his corner @Aubrey De Bliquy Apertheid government gave white every opportunity that was there to give.. I'm not sure what on about and until today.. we are in this condition because of their mess they caused "three hours talking about one transaction okay let drop it now Zondo we wasting money end this and go resume your duties as Chief Justice @Russia Magezi I'm not sure I follow allegation:A Judge who decided PP vs PRAVEN received R270 000 from CR17 but I'm sure nobody cares Duduzile Zuma mentions the Judge by name on Tweeter @Russia Magezi I'm sure u are one of those uncle Toms @Angelo Double Im just a nobody trying to wake everybody.. but I knew you ppl not seeking the truth but an Agenda... I'm looking for real evidence.. it so happen that she has evidence Google "@styx Ndlovo kulungile believe what you want to believe but iqiniso linemienze emfishane @Akhonamndla Gala I wish I was but Cha ngikwami baba Google the judge w okay scream it okay but the brainwashing that's done to some of these uncle Toms makes me feel sorry for your grandchildren... voluntary modern slaves @Angelo Doubel are you guys disputing what I'm saying or you don't want the truth to come out UK/USA and the west this ppl are not looking for criminals they are pushing an Agenda now you attacking Judge Hlophe who committed no crime I'm sure you were aware of that R270000 bribe it just that your problem is that the judge is not black🇿🇦🤐🤔👿 @karel gulston I thought judges are a part of legal matters unless u thought I was talking about Idols judges stay safe be a brother to every black men out there.. let love one another.. peace👍 @lerato you welcome
Barbara Sattler,you must be joking which land?
Martha Sello,Minister Ronald Lamola for President hi Diane what is she doing overseas? ran away 😂 @Celeste I think he's the only one who is still honorable so far! @Lerato that exactly my point what is she doing overseas? "if I remember the Guptas wanted to question Mcebisi Jonas but didn't want to appear to give evidence how come butternut head didn’t fight for economy when he was the State President he wants to fight now? "its really mind boggling that the are people who think Zuma is innocent Molefe is coming back and Ramaphosa is coming to appear why the other one must be treated differently @Andre that's the reason NDZ was supposed to replace butternut head so that they can complete looting whatever is still left of this Country NDZ was to complete the mission! That's the reason Ramaphosa is not acceptable to Zuma supporters. @Ndumie how is he going after Zuma cos this commission was set up by Zuma himself and Madonsela? @Louis Advovo is going for the killer with the email trail even dcj was getting lost 😂 @Lerato but dcj is waisting time he got lost on the email trails @Lerato agree dcj is enjoying it those are serious allegations that needs to be reported to the police for the fact that you are scared to name the judge yourself on this platform that says a lot so UK/USA and West used the Guptas in Saxonwold to capture our state? @Heather what do you expect from Judge Hlophe? Shoo @Lerato it reminds me of one anc member who said they will defend butternut head ka dibono! @Lerato today she drive around with Aston Martin at the expense of the poor they claim to represent cheers Lerato

Sal SA,@Diane hi Ms Daniels must explain why it was preferable to issue a guarantee Who from outside requested the guarantee??? "@Anne. yes i think the issue should be who the ultimate beneficiary was Also was the said beneficiary approved in the Board resolution @Don Su. This evidence is vital because it shows how executives in Eskom followed through on Zuma's objective of benefitting the Gupta's Ms Daniels is out of the discourse @Ndumie. Did African Bank receive a bail out? @Ndumie. Bailouts are an international practice if in the public interest especially loss of jobs Why didn't they specify the name of the proposed owner in the resolution "@Brightwell. Even so "@Brightwell. No sir @Brightwell. These are legal issues and have to be very clear. Now we sitting with a problem because people don't think its important/legalistic! @Brightwell.
