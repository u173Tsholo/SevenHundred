He put all these state capturers in SOE's Bossasa in SA....Bossasa in other countries....what is the difference? We all knew that they were crooks by then but still CR Junior took their business? "@carnoth ngomane As a private person yes Hehehe....where is the guy with the Gangster book now? CR must spend some CR17 money to look after this guy! Better than after his million Rand buffalo's 🤔🤔😎😎 ANC Agrezzi on the stand? All I hear is Bla Bla Bla Escom is going down....Buy candles and gas guys! This guy is now doing Khumbaya Please DCJ....Stop this lecture....it is boring! @Luvuyo Zantsi Who hates you baba? DCJ now sounds sad....he is right to be.....SA looks on while we are being plundered. Looks like the Public Protector is in trouble now? Parliament to debate if she is fit to be in her position. Gangster movie yes CR was the SG in 1996/7? 👹👹👹👹 At least Steenhuizen has a matric Ace of Spades @Boikutlo Manogi It is called the end of times....revelations "Our constitution is flawed. The political parties must not appoint MP""s but the people should directly vote them in. The MP's serve the Political Party and not the people." Linelani sounds like Faulty Towers? Comrades and credit cards....eish maan @Derek Main 100% Agree! Whole day was short time only?
Sindiswa Moolman,Is this guy who was given R10K transport fare to Bloem by Tony Gupta ? Thanks @mxolisi Buthelezi and @carnith ngomane @carnith ngomane The chair is losing his hearing I agree @Thando Nkutha. He is jumping the gun. cCR17 is still coming here. He is out of order ngoku I think he is marketing himself for a position from CR Im out of here now
carnoth ngomane,@Sindiswa Moolman he is the one "@Cerebis you are correct "@Cerebis i here you but he cannot stop living simply because his father is the president They are all bandits Money Happened to Ace a 67 year old is employed while the youth are just roaming the street
Lucricia Vorster,the one and only "Andile did do business with Bosasa...and appearantly a"" anti-bribery policy"" was signed.." "CR said if his kids ever consider doing business woth government and he so much as get a whiff of corruption Andile admitted that he did not pay attention to obvious red flags when he entered into agreements with Bosasa When Andile concluded business with Bosasa they were already n redflag institution..eoth regards to fraud...Why did they change their name to AGO??? Funny how they speak so softly here but at rallys and secret rendezvous they are very articulate and LOUD but were they not naughty lol caught eith their hands in the cookie jar... why is this guy explaining protocol as if we don't know..I mean clearly Zondo knows all this crap he is speaking now if they instructed to come forth with possible fraud/corruption issues why are we still having this inquiry one year later with no one brought to book.people are rather dying(dissapearing)mysteriously Defending attitude now.... well it was said that this inquiry will cost the taxpayer R230 million for the first six months...and will increase thereafter...its been over a year would love to know the cost now but how did we niw come to ANC talks now??? He is defending himself already for things yet to come...Why would he lecture the Commissioner????I think Zondo is leaving him to talk because he is no fool.these very same words will come back to him 😂😂😂😂😂 eh heh...'exactly what you said'...he is slowly hanging himself with these lectures... But really do you guys think there will be any arrests or anyone going to prison after this???thats if they dont miraculously die too 😅😅😅😅stephano dimera really 😂😂 zama khubeka i may just agree with you This Ace fella tho.... Yes Thats corruption of the highest hey.. nature called... Ace must come here man😅😅😅would love to hear what he has to say really The love of money change people because they get some form of power..it is ultimately about power and control 😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂 some humor atleast from Mokoena people in the free state are fed up with Ace hey Beatrice Marshoff is a scrub nurse now.. @gugu..best to do that okay ...here we go little ditcheee...little did we know ppl in free state and bfn have been saying this all along no one listened this guy is factual and i think if he was lying he would have slipped up and not once has he stuttered or said he doesnt know the government today is a reflection of whats happening in churches stru collection area 😅😅😅😂
Phillip Cwazibe,@ Sindiswa Moolman he was offered R2 million/month. This gentleman is lecturing the Commission. @ Concerned South African what if there was a meeting between Bosasa and the NPA investigators? That is the gist of how he state was captured.
Membry Maditsi,Ooooops! am here... is this people getting paid for just talking?we will never get closure for all this... Hahahahaha! they must be called... lol!!!! Truth is coming out....name them! viva! we just want the truth... kzn Truth is coming out! lol!!!!!! can't wait... this people must be arrested! just named them because we want closure to this...depression or whatever they must be arrested... name those big names. we want action before they fake death. we want that video clip... lol just name them! lol!!!!!!!!

Nkosinathi Nkabinde,their voices are very soft coz of the nice food they've eaten 😜
Thulani Bukani,can't wait till ANC has to appear.
Mashudu Tshikororo,transpired not expired
Derek Main,Mr X is probably Mr 10% Ace being elected to SG (or any position in the ANC) just shows how corrupt the organisation is. Everyone knows he is a serial criminal except for ANC members. @Thami Nobela Not if you have some integrity. Maybe that's how it's done in the ANC - they're all crooks. "@Yin Yang If our constitution is so great @Manfred Nkonki I hear you but our constitution allowed all these things to happen when it should have protected us from them happening. @Manfred Nkonki But that is my whole point. Surely the constitution should make it impossible for the cadres to defend and protect a constitutional delinquent? "@Manfred Nkonki And if the speaker of parliament and corrupt cadres decide there should be no motion of no confidence @Manfred Nkonki If they are not compromised ala Seriti "@Manfred Nkonki I'm saying considering where we have gone to as a country @Manfred Nkonki Then the constitution needs to be changed so that the NPA can be compelled to take up some cases and not fob them off like Abrahams did. "@Manfred Nkonki As for Zuma "@Manfred Nkonki There are many but off the top of my head @Manfred Nkonki We should have regular referendums to vote on important issues. @Manfred Nkonki I don't know - don't have those stats at hand. I know that less and less people are voting because it's futile. People are disillusioned with it all. @Manfred Nkonki Not sure I trust the JSC - Hlophe is still there. @Manfred Nkonki Sorry? I don't get your connection to the american system. @Manfred Nkonki Which is probably why we need to adopt the Chinese model for dealing with corruption - death! Not me "@Manfred Nkonki RE president
Graham Jackson,State of Capture captured again. First Jacob Zuma treated with kid gloves and now we have to revert to witnesses under oath only allowed to refer to culprits as Mr X. Come on DCJ. This is tax money Is the live feed on again. Cannot seem to open it
Mike Larry,Banana republic So much noise indeed Why does the SA flag have anc colours ? Is it a reminder to haunt us for the rest our lives? Socialism is so wonderful Me2 This guy should teach history Get ready for load shedding and disruption coming near you. ANC has no money 💰 There is no value in listening to this guys’ logic Lol I worked in Eskom as contractor once. And I concur with what he is saying. Employees only care for their payslips nothing else. It’s a disaster cANCer kills slowly. The decay has not completed yet. We were never in a hurry... that there is the problem They don’t sleep at night. Too busy at the shebeen. They sleep during office hours. Life is tough. what minutes? Lol there is no time Is Ace really a crook? I have a strange feeling he is just a distraction Petty party which one? ace is a zero "ace is number one

AUBREY KHALANGA BALOYI,dis state capture is just waste gornmnt money
michael mbatha,EFF and the Zupta cabal are teaming up to oppose SA progress. "And there are so many people with masters degrees "That's why Zuma appointed Mxolisi Nxasana as head of NPA. He knew Nxasana was compromised So Holomisa was not lying that Jessie Duarte was a tea girl at ANC headquarters. 😂😂😂😂 Ace follows process 😂😁😀😂 Sanitizing forensic reports. Shots will be fired here. Before pastors 😂😁😂😂 This man turns Agrizzi's testimony to Sunday school picnic. Even touching Pastors and judges in their studio.
Diana Sekatane,@Baloyi how would you have known the state at which we are. corruption really runs deep.
Buti Sipho,He's out of order now 😂😂😂 Judiciary is captured and media also captured

Moshoeu Mabusela,"we don't need lessons on ANC
Menzi Peter,Can the chairperson just stop this guy now.
Kevin Simon,This is just the trailer of what's to come. Spill the beans.. Having a poor economy makes it easier to enforce the corruption. Being a politician could mean living or dying of hunger...…. Wow!! It'll all come spilling out soon. Get the popcorn!!! This commission has MOSTLY been about ANC cadres corruption. Here is comes. Manfred Nkonki ​Am i the olny one concerned about how Watson died while the NPA is sitting idly by having not even prosecuted or begin to prosecute a single case. perhaps Thando Nkutha ​Judiciary is captured. He is saying just that. Supernumeraries. And the State doesn't have a wage bill problem. Cadre deployment.... cornerstone of ANC policy ---and Corruption

Mashamba Davhana,I agree who's mkhwebane? "there is no need for proof
Manfred Nkonki,where is the clip my brother. Nah these people sleep like babies. They no longer have any morals "@Thando Nkutha the ""love"" of money..." lol they will take your wife baba😂 Am i the olny one concerned about how Watson died while the NPA is sitting idly by having not even prosecuted or begin to prosecute a single case. Who is next on the hitlist? DCJ? @Derek Main Nah thats the NPA and the ANC protecting their own @Derek Main The constitution provides us with the greatest degree op protection. e.g. section 9 institutions. However these institutions are run by people who are only looking out for number 1 "@Derek Main It allows for a motion of no confidence. And will all those motions @Derek Main Thats where the judiciary steps in. @Derek Main thats why our courts make it possible to appeal and review a court's decision "@Derek Main Im not saying our constitution is perfect @Derek Main That is on the shoulders of the NPA. The couts cannot force the NPA to institute chargers or not to drop chargers. Zuma is facing his charges as we speak. @Derek Main which aspects of the costitution do you believe should be improved? @Thando Nkutha soon. @Derek Main No doubt. I fully agree. Zuma appointed people in powerful positions. NPA. So maybe if the JSC appoints the NPA? @Derek Main NDPP i meant @Derek Main exactly. Thats why following the american system will not be beneficial to us. "@If not the JSC @Derek Main Wrt electing our president directly.( i presumed that you meant the way they do in the USA) So i am saying because of our voter turn out that wont give results "@Derek Main LoL constitution protects everyone's right to life
