Phillip Cwazibe,@ Sibusiso Tshikovhi excpect Mr Ngubane to be arrogant and will evade questions. @ Mondli Nohashe knocked out b😦y facts
Mike Newlands,Morning All I am betting a cold one that our friend Ben is not going to pitch......he has a big mouth and talks out of both sides and enriched himself handsomely "@watson mutanga and plunder the SANDF Falcon 900 jet at R44 @vincent kolobe seat belts on and pop corn has popped "@Frank Jordaan that is something I forgot @Owen Nyilika that I do remember I knew then we were in deep trouble at Eskom🙄 Always remembering that these crooks never ever thought they would have to explain thier crooked thieving so hardly covered thier tracks. @Leon Mbangwa The idea was to maintian the equipment and balance that against little or no rolling blackouts. Sadly this bunch of thieves did nothing. "@Leon Mbangwa its how you steal the money EG Geof Makhubo madeR30m in a ""deal"" between him & Gupta company Regiments.He did nothing "@Beverley Barrett technically he could give a stuff about ESKOM his job was to loot
Residentc,"Dr Ben Ngubani connections. this should be intersesting
watson mutanga,"@Wesley Myburgh: Part of the problem is that we Africans follow ideologies we don’t understand @Wesley Myburgh: then we have an excuse of being racially discriminated against. The ANC are the liberators and as such are entitled to plundering state coffers. The list of excuses is endless. "When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men in a society Frédéric Bastiat "@Wesley Myburgh: entitlement is the main issue with the ANC. The ANC captured the state But we can change the jockey yet the horse is the main problem. What is required is a system and environment that makes it possible for even a donkey to run the country. Our biggest pitfall is our belief that education and religion are the answers to our challenges. Look at the CVs of most managers in SEOs. Very impressive CVs but not competent enough. "Integrity can’t be taught @Lorna Kavanagh: because on paper the people were qualified for their positions but they were incompetent. Their way of addressing their incompetence was outsourcing.
Andy,"@Resident
Fred Desrosiers,"@Watson mutanga ouch!! "But on the other hand since he used a Gmail account African countries should stop putting people in positions due to title. Competency should be the primary factor in putting position of power. no one outside of Eskom should have input in the Media statement Ohh Ohh. Ms Daniela just rolled over by the bus and now he put the bus in reverse to Roll over her again. "That is a load of c?+ "By the way Ms. Daniels was running the show!! "His excuse is
vincent kolobe,"😂😂😂😂 The arrogant Dr is in the building 😂😂😂😂😂 Dr Arrogance is no longer arrogant "No that he is cornered
Lucky Benya,"These two are gonna skin him alive
Douglas Masuku,both wesley He does look like former president former minister 9f technology??? me too "Why do we have high ranking board members of a high technology company who are not technically savvy? If they rely on others to make decisions
Sakhile Ndebs,people still watch this everyday?
Lucky Thwala,shows us the face of this thieves Mbuso:elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: young democracy uzobanjwa losathane Zondo has finished this bursted
Christy,The smirk on this advocate's face is like he has an Uno trap card 🤞
Nondumiso Soko,the Gupta board hhay must be nice. finish him advocate!!! this people come here ready to deny everything... even when there's evidence 😭 mhhh how convincing 🙄 @mbuso you need help ASAP.!! """businessman"" what's that Kani?" @Mbuso😂😂😂😂 @Mbuso 😂😂😂 "@Hlulani yup imagine if the same energy put into clicks was directed to the looting government.... that'd be great the relationship between the minister and the Eskom board is way beyond that of public concerns guptas = no peace 💀 so they don't know who this businessman is or they rather not say? that wasn't the question sir!!! I'm sorry to disappoint chair but I don't remember 😂😂#mr nzeku 😎
Angelo Doubel,welcome to Gupta associate Dr Ben @Frank yup 👍 @ Owen🤣🤣🤣 @ Owen 😂😂😂 @ Owen yup😅😅😅 😱😱😱 @Mbuso for sure 🤣🤣🤣 Advocate Seleka is meaning business today. @Carmen James 🤣🤣🤣 the SIU as civil claim against Dr Ngubane and his board for 3.8 billion the SIU as civil claim against Dr Ngubane and his board for 3.8 billion @ singi why didn't the ANC delegation use the Gupta helicopter to go to Zimbabwe. @Frank Jordaan 🤣🤣🤣
Frank Jordaan,Howzit guys and girls. More lies and denials in the Escom tragedy. Ben already on the defensive. Nhlanhla he thinks he is untouchable. Now he is trying to motivate the contract with McKinsey Lorna remember that McKinsey agreed to pay back the R1 billion in fees because it was tainted money. Mike I will look into it. Owen the corupt protecting their fellow gangsters Mike are you thinking of Anot Singh. He was at Transnet and then came over to Escom with Molefe. Investigations revealed that he never touched his salary paid into his account for 4 years. Leon it is still no excuse for stealing billions of taxpayers money. Kagiso he must start charging the commission appearance money😜😜😜😜 Kagiso get well soon. Our mistakes do no involve billions of stolen money and ruin the economy. So you could give the board the biggest load of bull they would just approve it. Miss Daniels should have been the CEO. She knew everything according to Ben. Samuel the perception is that they got rid of Tsotshi to appoint their 'man'. Eddy jip. That board had no idea what was happening at Escom. They only had one objective and the smooth running of Escom did not feature. So my predecessor did it!!! Ndumien it is clear that it was Essa. Pamensky also used the same email address to send secret Escom documents to. Owen high five for that one I did not read everything but made decisions costing SA billions. Carmen the facts point to Salim Essa. Eddie and he ate tons of money. Eddie he was just another puppet on a string and to rubber stamp the illegal looting. Nape couldn't agree more. Samuel one wonders about that as well. Thulani jip. Goodwill it was Salim Essa or Tony 'Slimebag' Gupta. Pamensky also sent e mails to this e mail address. Could be Tony Gupta. Mr Green an outsider who basically ran Escom. Mondli this business man also received e-mails from other Escom people. If it was a DG why not use his official e-mail address. Chairman of 3 entities but trying to tell us he needed outside help to run Escom🙄🙄🙄🙄 If I remember correctly all these emails were part of the Gupta leaks. Why if he and his board communicating with a DG. "Samuel vat hom Dawie Blake I love the man. Council just dropped a bomb!!! Samuel where are those days😭😭 Been telling us the whole morning that businessman was Mr Seleke🙄🙄🙄🙄 Mondli the wind is out of his sails. Samuel sy tanne is getrek. Sirshin my issue as well. Thobani you are right. So Mr Seleki was at Transnet but advising Ben on how to run Escom. The plot thickens. Salim Essa!! There it is out in the open. Where is the arrogance now???? Nhlanhla is that shebeen still operating or did they close down when the Guptas fled. Martha he thought he was going to walk over the DCJ and council "And now that other arrogant man Singi no it was a jet. Ma baker that is when he said that there was no payment to Tegeta. Eisj wonder if that DG ever slept????? Angelo that chopper was repossessed 😁😁😜 And now Mr Zwane's role being exposed. Canis agree. Joe I remember that. Russia Salim Essa. Already mentioned by council and also confirmed by Escom employee Miss Daniels during her disciplinary hearing. Essa also fled to Dubai.

Seleka was tired of the dilly dallying 😂🤣 @Singi Mathebula He's been like this but he first studies the witness and in time assume this stance especially if the witness is giving the commission a run around @Singi Mathebula 💥🌌🤣 Dr. Ngubane Talk to my representative about that otherwise I don't know who the businessman is "@Frank Jordaan That's exactly my difficulty. Was he managed in all his positions because ""we're a young democracy""? 🤷🏾‍♂️" @Mondli Nohashe He was an equal for Kate Hofmeyer or Adv Maleka 'The president's keepers' alluded to these.

He knew exactly what the state of affairs were. Arguably he was comfortable @Russia Magezi Perhaps it's because of my intolerance for all kinds of devils that I put him with everyone 😅🤣 @Carmen James I also am leaning more towards him and not Mr. Seleke @Ronny Choeu He's running away with the Guptas. He probably is somewhere in UAE
Gabisile Mabuza,Now we are stuck on the emails "I am reminded of Mr Ndzeku when he said ""I remember that I don't remember""...🤣🤣🤣🤣"
