FredBKevin,no visuals? "I dont think Vytjie is lying  All things conidered what she said is coherent with the other testimonies we heard so ......what is so unbelievable It is reasonable to assume that a normal man/women could get some of the detail re key details wrong as she only visit the gupta compound once. Reasonably speaking.
Bheki Mdletshe,No Vytie is lying and blaming everyone else. I don't trust her testimony anymore How will the Guptas know if their records will be required? She is lying! Zuma once said all those who ask for the enquiry into state capture will be surprised. No one expected the Bosasa to be dragged into this. Vytie lied I like her style of questioning but she is a bit disorganised There is nothing wrong with the advocate - her admin are sloppy but she is doing a great job Some of the records are not adding up to make Mentor's statement credible. This is difficult because the Chair is protecting Mentor here. Wait for the cross examination One of the Gupta brothers was not in China. Ms Mentor. Lets move on please Even the chair is confused about these brothers Zulus were blessed to lead the country lol. They are very powerful people. Xhosa people sold the country. Those ones are corrupt What is a constituency period Ms Mentor? She lied about certain things. You will see why this advocate is doing when cross-exam is coming. There are already holes. Now the statement change again. If there was no cross examination - this statement would have gone unchanged I knew where the advocate was heading! I like her way of digging. Confused now I want to tell the Guptas that I would make a great Minister of Engineering Cross examination will expose Mentor even further I respect Advocate Sello. There is value in what she is doing She is the evidence leader and there are many inconsistencies in Mentor's statement. Big up advocate! When you come to give evidence you must be asked all the way I miss Agrizzi uyazi Now can we move to cross exam please Now she is adding something new and implicating another person. The Chair is very patient
PETER STAFFEN,it is easy when you got 2 or 3 passports to also travel Moira T just block him and then he is gone Talent P Sibis all you is block the clown and then you free of his comments david cele block him and you dont have to read his crap
Abel Manyedi,my worry with Y mentor is too defensive nd that can derail her testimony breathalyzer plz chair during tea. I smell something 😀😀😀 she's gonna cry under cross examination August that month kkkkkk

terranark,"if I were a lawyer going up against her testimony halala! you didn't do your job. don't lie halala! can you not call China and ask? I mean certainly they have no interest in lying? just ask China's home affairs just report yose and block. dude is just spamming she studies her own statement 😂😂😂. but YOU said it. what do you need to study? "Judge judge are really entertaining such hearsay? easiest witness self destruction @muzie just report and block dude report Yose And block him. easy clap Boyz. let's go! "we have the right to speak @Juga and you get a report and a block I love cleaning up chat. We'll turn with into family friendly twitch chat. one block at a time "Agrizzi will say ""we paid Mentor to mess up her statement""" no @Solly. we don't believe what we WANT to believe in court. we believe what the evidence says. if a witness is not credible and is constantly contradicting themselves then you cannot take anything they say as fact. nor can you use it as grounds to motivate a conviction you can't use Mentor's testimony to support a case. a rookie lawyer could crush that case @thuso her testimony is weak. so a weak lawyer could easily crush her Ignore Yose. block and report and move on 😫 mentor please @nkanyiso you fail to understand a unified society. melanin is not a marker for rights to speak at the table. if you want to make weak threats then you agree with the old government blocked and reported nkanyiso. move on. eskom said stage 4 is serious
Briony French,you all forgetting its not just her testimony against the guptas South Africa doesnt like dual citizens how did they manage to have 4 different country passports if you apply for a South African passport they dont like you having a dual passport and they can turn around and say pick. so how does he have 4 what about the guptas private jet? and them moving through our army air bases like waterkloof there is that guy who is still hunting his plane because they the guptas turned the black box off and that is also a breach of aviation rules. Mentor bring up the private jet and no customs being around to check passports "bring up the private jets and avoiding real airports "guys you all need to stop looking at colours or tribes... we are all south african we want a better life.you need to let it go. you cant control people. only yourselves. you want change "@thando ignore the racist begging for attention yose warn not worn did someone wear you out like a jacket

Vish Govender,Miss Mentor should be given an investigating team. She may do a better job. She has an interest as opposed to others.
Sinekhaya Njovu,Zondo must deal with his frustrations in chambers DCJ should perhaps adjourn and address the frustrating issues with the legal team otherwise this degenerate into a sideshow Rather adjoutn for tea and resolve issues Transparent on relevant information pertinent to the ToR of the commission

Mzwanele shange,this adv came from a jehovas witness walk-around to this commission @rohan banard... I would have done that a long time ago... what happened to 'excuse' when someone just crack a cough in my ears 😏 bundles again @Yose Human I've reported you and your account is going to be suspended chair it's collAborate... thank you I just wanted to state that
Nelson Musoliwa,The chair seems confused with the paragraph Mentor read to him saying it says what is not saying yoo More about files than mentor evidence shame English seems to bit problematic for the chair bit difficult for him to construct questions clearly it is so with this advocate as well the reason why so waste of time @barnard Standard is bit low Zulus are powerful in their own accord and as South African i am proud of Zulus as they are my fellow South Africans In SA context it is foolish to be tribalism for Africans. I view tribalism in the same light as apartheid and racism. @Kim what is tuisland? I am barred from communicating with FF unfortunately @KIM who do not live in homeland in SA as each and every piece of land is a homeland with or without kings/queens. Nobbody lives on sea or sky @KIM I stated it clearly that i view tribalism; racism and apartheid in the same light if u know what the meaning of the 3 are Mentor is struggling a lot which borders on an unreliable witness with a bit of senselessness. U necessary complain by Mentor truthful facts will never contradict self so she must be driven by the only truthful facts she presented she must be prepared to account for her contradictory version . Not her attitudes but her response adv unless if u have some issues with Mnetor
Anne M.,@rohan barnard 😂 I blocked him/her. Don't have time for that k@k. "@Derrick Busani Yes @teddy buckshat Most of us have blocked that idiot because he's just a troll trying to get a rise out of people. @Lew464 Please ignore the troll (Yose).

Niematullah Rakeep,Is this commission not a transparent process? "A person with wisdom and experience will know this ""Fakey"" person is lying through her teeth." The judge must not stop her from talking. The more she speaks the more she even confuses herself. Her statements are so full of contradictions. She is trying to confuse the Commisioners now. "If Thuli (Truly) Madonsela (Madonsellout) report was based on ""Fakey"" input then this Commission is a joke. Anyways Agrizzi made the Commission exiting."
