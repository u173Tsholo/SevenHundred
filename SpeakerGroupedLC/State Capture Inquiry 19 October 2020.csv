Thobani Tyhaliti,Mr Makwanaz don't explain give an answer and explain when asked.
Tee M,I'd also drink that water if I were him because heyiiii 😥 Why are his eyes so shifty and why's he fidgeting? "Can someone rescue Mr. Mkhwanazi 🤣🤣 Ahhh this man.... Looks like a kid who just got caught with their hand in the cookie jar. Yohhhh Mr. Myburgh ain't taking no prisoners. Mr. Mkwanazi is just clowning at this point Why can't he look into the camera? My new favorite phrase for 2020 is.......

thando cezula,Morning all! Kunjani Khanyi? This guy has made so many concessions I can't keep up Morning Queen B WHY? Mr Myburgh is a Rockstar! Mkhwananzi must just come clean! He's whole testimony doesn't make sense Morning Val DCJ is not bothered by insults of ANC and EFF! @Mbuso: He's been agreeing with the Commission throughout his testimony Morning Sal @Mbuso: Yet another concession 😂😂😂 Valencia molo I miss you Will Mr Gama be testifying? Mkhwanazi's actions speak louder to his guilt than his lies! He can lie all he wants but the evidence is there! Where did the get Myburgh? He's a pocket rocket! A dynamite in a small package! Mkhwananzi tell the truth! Set your soul free! Lol@ hindsight Ayihlangani tu Wiseman! Ingxaki they never thought this day would come! "And if he defies the commission Galela chair! GALELA! Chair is tired of this nonsense! He sees right through this crook! The question is WHY? @Thami: this was has agreed with the Commission on almost everything He's made so many concessions its hard to keep up with all of them Akemdala lotata for uxoka! Chiskop is getting shinier Morning ALTA Yolo hoezit? Ndiyaphila enkosi! Binjani impela veki? LOL hayi lotata EFF trolls have arrived Malema must come and assist the Commission! Finish and klaar! Even Lucky Montana is wetting his pants Malema won't collapse anything! This is not that circus or gossip show he hosts from time to time and calls it a media briefing session @Yolo: You're right! Some EFF supporters are too far gone! 2nd suspect arrested in Senekal court saga! Treason must be severely punished! No one is above the law! Taking a firearm into the building representing one of the arms of the state is treasonous! You enter judicial sacred ground and threaten to take the law into your own hands and you call that civil disobedience? This madala must finish up now he's done for! Guilty as charged! NEXT! Noted Leon thanks! Now let's let the law take its course! YHO YHO YHO! The state must recoup that money from Mkhwanazi and Co. Fry him Mr Myburgh Expensive and fraudulent Clear fraud! JUST TELL THE TRUTH!!! All he knows is to agree is gama going to testify? WHY? Yho this madala!!! This guy won't give up his masters! Commission is going round and round! Madala is done! Next witness plz! He's been agreeing with the Commission since he got there! Is Gama going to testify or will Hawks pounce before that? They acted with impunity and never dreamt they'd be answering for their sins! He's made at least 50 concessions since getting here """Hindsight"" the scapegoat of words" "He didn't capitulate Correction: He took South African taxpayers to the cleaners "After this testimony Lol @ layman A layman who was an MEC "@Zama: ""As I'm sitting here...""" AFU must do the things and get the pots Myburgh is a bulldog Top 3 evidence leaders: 1. Mr Pretorius/2. Ms Hofmeyr /3. Myburgh I like Myburgh's style! Surgical yet confrontational! On the last day of the Commission I propose we have Zondo Commission Awards! BEST PERFORMANCE: Kate skinning Nzeku alive This has been an outstanding performance by Myburgh BEST PERFORMANCE BY A WITNESS: Angelo Agrizzi @Angelo:He deserves a Razzie 🤣🤣🤣🤣 He doesn't know anything but signs on the dotted line This is bioscope! Yi filim! Yi prent! Issa movie! It's fraud chair! Not weak... CAPTURED! NONTSENTSICAL! Chair already knows the game here! He's just trying to take this nonsense to its logical conclusion """I understand your anxiety"" 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Donovan Landsberg,@Sy Makaringe agreed. I also don't appreciate it if my name and surname are miss quoted. I was once called Mr. Goldberg @Mello Motaung Adv. Myburg only has 1 hour to sort out the witness @Mello Motaung agreed he is focussed on the work at hand At what point do you just give up and admit to guilt? Some of these witness are just delaying the inevitable. @SanFran Arnold @Valencia J Maybe DCJ must just make a call and hand them over to the authorities to finish the job. @SanFran Arnold I can only imagine his frustration to having to tick all the boxes before acting. I don't know how former Pres Zuma can survive these hearings @mboniseni mtuli my sentiments exactly DCJ is paying his role very well. Looking after us the citizens "@Michael Michael DCJ requested early start today to ""finish off"" Mkwanazi." @Pastor J.J whatever term you use it is the same difference @Pastor J.J I agree its difficult to contain oneself with characters like this. Mkhwanazi adamant to support the losing team Let us agree that it is quite difficult for the evidence leader to be on his feet the whole day. Can't a different arrangement be made to help them perform better? @sammy sammido someone wants to say something vulgar to you (@Pastor J.J )

Heather Durr,Morning my dear colleagues. Please say a prayer for my very painful tooth and the dentist can only see me tomorrow. I am sure your posts will sooth me. Who is up to be fried today🛌 I thought Malema would be waiting for him early this morning Do they want him to admit that he was acting on the instructions of Zuma-He is not going to-They have a mountain of evidence . My cat just slapped me with her claws after I flicked her on her nose @Pastor J.J he better hurry up as the North Pole is melting very quickly A cat is worse that an unfaithful husband @Sibongile Maputi Looks like he is in the shower Its not Ant Row Bis. Its Antrobis He is misrecalling @rohan barnard DCJ and Seleka would be laughing so much nothing would get done @rohan barnard yes they do work well together Whut.... 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Myburgh why the heck did you go there 💀💀💀 Myburgh I want to see Mahlangu-GET A MOVE ON Finish it DCJ should have said 'what the *** were you thinking. I am sick of your ****. Stop **** with me and wasting my time
Bizana Ngesi,Can't believe what I am hearing from Mr Mkhwanazi. This gentleman was paraded previous as a well grounded Executive.I always held him up as a real top dog. I am disgusted that Mr Mkhwanazi doesn't know the difference between a request and an instruction. He was INSTRUCTED to reinstate Mr Gama as a condition for him to be a Chair of Transnet.

Anax B,there is need to completely overhaul the process of appointing board members. clearly the likes of this old man and Tsotsi have no business seating on any board. stop this fool from talking this nonsense..
Thabo Mokoaleli,"Mr. Mkhwanazi is only afraid of saying the instructions came from Zuma. Therefore There is no way that a reasonable Board can ignore three Law Companies that come into the same conclusion that Gama has no reasonable prospects of winning against Transnet 😅😂😝🙋 "Hi Theo DCJ has already indicated that Gigaba will be called to the Commission 😂😅 /

SOUL FIRE,@andre gerber 😂😂😂
Samuel Skosana,So right Pastor I like that Canis It is amazing how Zuma's name instills fear in the hearts and minds of ANC supporters who are in very high Official positions The weekend papers suggest that over 1600 ANC deployees were compromised I am being generous Valencia His ducking and diving is because he has a picture of Zuma watching him from his wall that he keeps on looking at Ms Hoffmeyer for President And I must take out a bank loan to pay my Tax assessment Wipe this smile off his face Mr. Myburgh Sekgolo you mean his Crown Jewels Chair is getting angry now. Finish him off Mr Chair4
Michael Michael,the chair is onother person tody. he make show he dont have direct answer i don't know did we start at nine tody?? thanks Anorld hope they finish him.and take his sizes. all those criminals must pay all the money back.by doing that many young people will get employment.and stop defending those criminals who put them on the street.95m.for 24 month.i trusted mr Nyanda . he take too long to answer agree lebo he is useless donavan bcz they were bizy stealing wt os this off shore account not sure if i write it ryt? is so swit to lei he is tired just dont understand y he just tell the truth.but in the court of law.he will just loose. Sam he can come and proove his innocent here. he os watching uyaposisa va. he can just talk to her she want 150k for maitenance.mara ndi nnzhi. those people were not ceo 's. Steinhoff??? fine they are working for this money not stealing it. he want more water. "Nemabubuni doesn't mean he is clever.he can still go to jail.look at those who hire to commit look at Vincent Smith
Cocong Khoboko,The chair is sick and tired of lies
Maggie Mazabane,"let's close this case "that is correct whatever he says has no relevance to the question... "...and he ends everything with ""yes""" "just say YES "I'm sorry DCJ beats me... this must be closed before lunch... "etc "Yah! Mr. Makwanzi "hurray "Inexplicable "Let's land it now ...wry smiles of makwanazi "...""hidesight""" I see the hawks car parked outside the commission venue...
Mat Masango,commission is not targeting certain individuals but know who were the for front in state capture however some people failed to distinguish between request and instruction
Arnold Alexander,they all a bunch of crooks not one of our officials in government are honest
Person of interest,Principles 🤣🤣🤣 So many irregularities that you had to have a spreadsheet! Lots of 👀 in this place now Lucky he didn't kill me. it was long ago before all this.... "Come boys "As I sit here chair They must get the corruptors
Rendani Netshiheni,eeeh...eeeh...eeeh..when he's lying...such embarrassment to Mkwanazi's family JOZI JOZI 👍👍 DCJ and the evidence leader are trying their best to push this incompetent former chairperson to admit and reveal the names of those who has instructed him to do stupid things as a leader "it was the instruction from Gigabyte and Gigabytes got intruction from Zuma just imagine if he was your father lying under the oath in public...the whole world is watching
Dr Petrus Dumisa,Mr Mkhwanazi seems to have worked for the State Capture to ensure reinstating Mr Gama. He could not take a principle position as he was bias towards serving his master. One wander why the appointment of board members and chairs are recycled as if the are limited people in South Africa with capabilities and abilities to run proper functional boards. Why choose a weak advice instead of opting for information before you that indicated that there was no need to re-instate Mr Gama. Mr Mkhwanazi is completely incompetent person to be a board chair "Musa
joyce tendai Zvavareyi,I remember one witness stated that the chair wanted at least someone come up with something that could help him to articulate the position of getting Gama back w it's getting hot this man was a gentleman but its all gone the lies makes one sick and tired this madala will certainly be nabbed. Highly corrupt! """hellbend on getting Mr Gama reinstated""" he borrowed my wording word for word. I like it yes thanks hellbent indeed kkkkk "Gama is likely going to deny everything even his name ""Gama""" why is ntate refusing to appear before the board any more?
Mzwanele shange,can the chairperson summarise for me what subjects he has dealt with since i was not aware that he was going to start before 10 🙄🙄🙄🙄 why does he keep doing this
Nicolas Cocolas,Is he looking up at the Angels to come down and save him ? Not weak. Crooked as Crap
Rob Nel,"Looking and listening to this guy How can this guy give any instruction or advise. He can hardly answer a question
Mike Newlands,So Cele is finally being investigated but of course not by the corrupt police but by Zondo Commission.

This one is in hindsight Eish @Zama Nxumalo. He drove me up the wall. Well @Gift Mazibuko someone here was questioning the art on his wall on Friday.

Cobus Hechter,This man is a disgrace. He's not answering the questions for he's lying for somebody else. Zondo has finally woken up. I hope he stays this alert for the Zuma seat. I believe they running out of time. Zondo will gave to stand his ground based on the arrest of the 7 over the last 3 weeks. Aidan Brian my prayer is that the truth will prevail and the ANC will be exposed. We South Africans must not stop praying for our country. EFF and ANC is going to run us all into bankruptcy. Roban I agree. State captured by Gupta through Zuma. because the ANC will not listen to you as the voter's. dont vote for them The time has come that we as the citizen of this country don't fall for the fear the EFF and ANC has put into its members and all of uss. in hindsight "hes not a fool he already shed the beans. his eyes spell fear. thando you funny in your commenting

keeran kerar,Wat do all of u say about the former procutor wants to give these rouges ammunisty
Dan Brown,Can you imagine JZ testifying like this? He won't come to the commission. He will claim the internet is broken or no coverage. "The Zuma Family and Extended family Bank accounts will be interesting. You can't hide all that Money in cash unless it's in Fort Know Safety deposits. JZ was very clever Everyone in Government should have an Asset audit Didn't JZ not have enough money to buy a suit to go to court in the early 2000's he had to borrow money for rent etc. Now Nkandla's bunker is full of money JZ has a cuban passport "JZ will need a 70"" LED TV to use as his Teleprompter and will still get his Millions wrong" cant wait for ACE and BHEKI. Maybe if you can get Shabir Shaik off the golf course for long enough as well. LifeStyle Audits I had high hopes for Ramaphosa because he didn't need the Money he was already a wealthy businessman. Seems the power balance is delicately balanced unitl ACE or one of the JZ cronies get implicated. One of those earphones is the commission the other is his Legal Coach. "Brian Molefe still hasn't paid back the R30 million ""Pension"" yet. That Money has long gone to a Gupta owned bank in Iran or somewhere" Gavin Watson took a lot with him in his Fake suicide. That could so easily have been staged and the perpretrator in the Passenger seat walked away quietly. You could hear JZ and ACE sigh with relief.
Eddie Reddy,Does CDJ have full time body guards.? "CDJ tell this scamp you will recommend that all his assets will be frozen together with the other board members. then he will jump and say no
Thapelo Motabogi,"who does zondo want back
Sasa Z,@ Dan Brown exactly my thought for days but today even more convinced that we will never see him there! 🤣🤣🤣 He accepts everything!

Hope are learning @SanFran Arnold definitely! Still nursing them in totality 🙈 @ Valencia 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙄🙄 Ms Hofmeyer is my go girl !

Jackson Mahlaule,Zondo must ban the word hindsight. please this word must not be used anymore at the commission
Trevor Arosi,Such a pity that our Black talent in SA has been found wanting in the scale. Most have been compromised through their greed appetite. Tommygun: many have been give a chance to prove their worth but have been found wanting. It's such a pity they project a picture that Blacks cannot manage or be trusted in position of influence. "R13m???? yhooooo It will be interesting to see how much did Mkhwanazi and his board got out of this reinstatement deal with their handlers. The judge is ANGRY now
The Delicious Monster; it’s really a plant,@ABRAHAM 😄😄😄😄😄
Bongiwe Moeli,DCJ is very moderate in his questioning. Mr Mkhwanazi was not interested in reports that were written by his predecessor’s lawyers and moreover he wrongly applied the race card to Siyabonga’s case. "This is infuriating and serves as a true reflection of the composition of public service sector boards. He’s an embarrassment to his people. He must pay back the money "Go Myburgh "Valencia J you are so right "It’s easy to sign off on monies that are not yours. No sense of obligation Need to open a criminal case against Makhwanazi "Agree Pheladi Get angry Chair. We are not fools😳
Owen Nyilika,Tell him Zondo Mr Gama pay back our Money pls Zondo so angry tday
