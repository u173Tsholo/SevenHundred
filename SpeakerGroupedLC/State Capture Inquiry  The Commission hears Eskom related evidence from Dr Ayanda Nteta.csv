There had been people testifying that claim they are CA or Dr's @Paul Amoomo I did not cause or participate in state capture so my qualifications dont matter. But I see you are very sensitive to this. Just chill we all friends "@Minnib Prince We are all here together against corruption. But some completely miss it OK @VigoSun its over now. Let it go "The devil might be in the detail. She might have left Eskom for the right reason "Ah same old story. Implementation is my responsibility. Formulation Comon chat can we atleast pretend to stand togher against corruption? Even for just a few hours? Theres lots of space on facebook and twitter to take on race issues @dee dee cocroft I cant wait for Koko @Power Electronics Thanks for the history lessons. But you can let it go now. we have moved on @nkosingiphile ndlovu I think she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But she did act biased and that bodes ill for her from WHO at coal operations...? @Santa Kriel Huh? Where is this coming from? WHy am I dragged into this? "@Santa Kriel  @VigoSun We call it the Amoeba Effect. One part cant move without the rest softning and moving with it. Just like these crooks "To all these ppl saying its a waste of time: You are missing the value of the information that reaches the public. Even if this information changes your vote Huh? How can a 1960's contract and finance model be used in 2015...? I find this to be madness Oef ouch this is dammning... "@wandy Zouloe @Heather Durr I agree she was an enabler.

Teunis im handing out some klaps today.... haibo Pastor no no Teunis jy is te cute lol very true Pastor we need more humor she is sure of some things but the very important details she is not hmmmm not answering why she was suspended - real reason to leave you dont get a hearing etc why had you to be disciplined!!! very fishy sorry to say people must stop using race as an excuse!!! back = bad the bushman where here first then the ships came to Africa surely people who give evidence should have their facts straight 100 % agree Heather  back lol Louiz\s jy soek ne this is all explaining the question asked by Seleka yesterday and to why it took 3 years + before the contract was actually signed etc. Yesterday she could not say why but today its a different story. they gave relief for 10 months and no penalty's then she gives them another 3 months and then impose penalties - doesnt sound right to me... Penalty should of been issued after first relief given imho Glad DCJ is reading our minds..... Awesome DCJ Heather my hubby has watched it so many times that its now irritating me.. i loved Dallas!!! ditto Sal SA the whole team does Sal SA now now tea is 10 mins that should be interesting Heather . you forgot lockdown Alta lol yip and it will continue Heather and Alta ? why are parents not home schooling their children.. hi naledi scorching Valencia J i want winter ah she pushed herself into those meetings etc  i c 2 trying to find out who was the main contact on sa side with guptas lol Gerard my thoughts too Sal SA these grammatical error contracts should be illegal oh love that giggle from dCJ okay all i concede she has a beautiful skin exactly why not correct it before sending it out "all departments concerned how can there be trust after the first meeting with Tony as she told us yesterday. She had to have more dealings with him!! no Yes what is your answer so she trusted the guptas and not the people she works with eisch for sure Heather wandy its shocking and maybe thats why she was suspended for meetings behind the companies back. why not go higher p in the chain but then you stated at the company and continued to work there - come clean lady plse.... stated = stayed  the payment she made plse S "you know what sorry but i could never employ a person like this......

Lol let's play house why don't we? @Minnib eita (BEE) yes it is. It's years and the anc still have not closed the gap mxm. Paul careful of the semantics annalise lol that's a start. I understand the frustration though. The same people in poverty vote the same crooks that don't implement jobs or lack the ability to make such changes. more like eat words not food. Diane no. africans were manipulated and lacked means to defend themselves. They simply brought a gun to a spear fight. Yes but now africans own RPGs Lol diane 90/10 % I don't like those odds.

Lee D. Hendrix,...The DEVIATION is included to allow for Gupta and Essa's shell companies to take control of government funds.  ...No one claimed a need for coal excpt the investors abroad in ESKOM. ...Millionaires need jobs to control the prosperity of poor people and the less fortunate handicapped. All Africans are also born of ethnicity on the continent. Some refuse to identify as African. ...Jesus Christ walked across borders as property of the Holy See Government and caused citizens to become traitors to their respective Nations. "...The contracts are guilty of corrupting SAfrica "... The coal was to be imported from elsewhere for incorporating banks abroad ...Allowing a foreign entity/ person to control a President's duties is a self inflicted wounding....... "....Conspiring to commit fraud is not legal "...Ramaphosa will not declare emergency status for SAfrica ...A Constututional State of Emergency is so written for survival ...The game of monopoly is alive and well....... "...The Affrican nations must be kept divided ...She's a queen...
