Tebogo Sibilanga,Number 1 Tsotsi Yusuf Towing yusuf Dintshang? He did not ask because JZ made sure his puppets were appointed to the board It means JZ knew the agenda to be discussed "As long as Eskom continues to be an ANC project and remote controlled by politicians "The role of Eskom is to provide quality and uninterrupted power supply to the citizens Eskom is a cash cow for the ANC vultures. They want the entity to remain monopolised so that they continue to feed off it. Nomvula told us his husband was confident of an eskom tender "The majority of the people who are voting for the corrupt ANC have no interest in watching this blatant corruption on full display in FHD. As long as their ignorance remains embedded @Akhonamandla Gala 😂 Gupta Curry Recipe: Prison was built for the poor who have no access to quality legal services. Not for the politicians and the rich "Mr Tsotsi should consider changing his surname Mr Tsotsi once cried with Brian Molefe "So in summary Zondo is ready to press 5 minutes on the microwave to warm his skhafthini

Mike Newlands,@Kevin Davis I wonder what he actually did when at Eskonm for his R8m pay cheque each year? @Syug Absolute puppet on a string. "@James Godloza Godloza Gordhan said to Brown(who lied in parliament by the way) that the ""ANCdoesnt steal in millions the ANC steals in billions"" -so she is ANC yes so therefore definitely corrupt.🤒" @Luyanda A It creates an opportunity for corruption and would you object to Eskom sponsoring a DA event? @Luyanda A these are political parties not charities or would you support ESkom supporing FF Plus "@Luyanda A Actually your question is exactly why this countr a failed basket case.The DA can be sponsored sure BUT NOT with tax payers money "@Luyanda A My apologies did not mean to offend @Patrick .Solarnfo agreed lets learn This business of the ANC prostituting MP's for money was always unethical & darn right right disgusting.They are public reps' & should be available to all not just those that can enrich the ANC. @Mohamed Mia I know 😳just airing my frustrations as we learn why we are the new basket case of Africa 😩. They are indeed the cANCer ofg our once great country "@Tebogo Sibilanga spot on. I experianced the same attitude with the whites under apartheid

Aubrey De Bliquy,@NOXOLO GUMEDE bra? He is only boring if you are looking for entertainment rather then facts. I understand your point. A directive to stop the business of Eskom does seem sinister and does raise fundamental questions. This chairman is impressive. @Syug without even putting it in writing which suggests in itself an incompetence and subservience to authority without accountability. All bucks stop with the voters holding executive accountability ESKOM failure is national economic sucide before covid added the coup de grace @Patrick .Solarnfo Do you agree eskom faiure to be able to supply enough electricity is as fundamental a failure as any country can make. Load shedding is in itself an admission of epic failure. It's not dust buildup on insulators like we got when this started. @Patrick .Solarnfo So you think load shedding is something routine in a functioning country> @Patrick .Solarnfo are you aware of the disruptive costs of load shedding to industry? Sme factories are disasterously disrupted. @Patrick incompetence that is not in Eskom is incompetence de-facto in government. @Patrick .Solarnfo incompetence in business is regulated by bankruptcies. Eskom cannot have a monopoly and plead incompetence thus holding all hostage. How so? @Patrick .Solarnfo My point is that Eskom cannot be allowed to hold a monopoly over a vital national service they are incapable of providing. OK sane people agree Yet the law provides eskom a legislated monopoly on electricity supply thus holding the economy to ransom OK This commission chair is on point. @Pheladi Lamola I think their is a corrupt mindset that cannot comprehend the concept of conflict of interest. I see Eskom failure as a collective failure not to be laid at the door of any one incumbent because this infrastructure requires 20 year foresight and planning LOL @Luyanda A That is called corruption. Don't you understand conflict of interest? @Tebogo Sibilanga On point. 💯 "@Luyanda A Eskom is granted a monopoly service vital to the nation. They provide a service that provides 20 year planning. which could span EFF @Salome Seabi Perhaps that says more about the consensus on corruption than CR who the moment he had the authority as president declared his intention to end corruption as he now is doing. @Mike Clark I think even a private company uses OUR MONEY since we allow corporations to profit off our economy and people. We cant say like FU eskom we are going to buy our electricity from a company that supports EFF. The point is we can see how easily the ANC could use this sutority to fund ANC functions. Yup @Patrick .Solarnfo 100% agree. Any incumbent could use authority over eskom to sponsor party political functions. I never joined the witch hunt against JZ and feel the same about CR. deputy yes i.e.e unlike justice Zondo he should not be in government. Does not understand the basic spirit of service. A company with a monopoly should not need to influence government. It just has to be efficient in service delivery. yes Yes @Salome Seabi As a borne again Dagga user I was watching the Trial of the Plant when SABC and the state and their amicus causae were trying everything to stop scale of harms evidence being lead. "The decision by all our ""HIGH"" court that dagga use in private was a constitutional right was the ""hight"" point of our thriving democracy. LOL" @Thobani Mkananda No offense taken. To each is own. "@Thobani Mkananda A bit off topic @Thobani Mkananda Don't get me started on the COVID19 panic-Demic. A pandemic of stupidity. We have a life threatening virus so like lets close down the country and destroy ppeople income for survival "You get lies ok "Mandela said ""If the ANC does to you what the Apartheid government did to you then you do to the ANC what you did to the Apartheid government.""" OK i get it bro Is telling the truth is piemping? If so one has to choose between piemping and perjury and jail. yes of coure. Some people do not understand the concept of rule of law as opposed to mob rule. Eskom should lose their monopoly the moment the load shed shows they are incapable of meeting the needs of the economy. let us all make electricity and fit two way meters to feed the grid. Eskom then pays us if we use less than we generate. they already have this but it needs to be improved. "SABC won't post the full videoto fill the gaps. Same as when they were complicit in concealing the scale of harms evidence in the ""Trial of the Plant"". They did not want the public to hear the truth." @Thobani Mkananda I think when democracy started there was complicity between the negotiating partners. I can't prove it but it looks like dirty hands dont want to investigate They are all captured by the same mentality we see on display from this witness. They have no clue the part their subservient submissive attitude to government plays in undermining service delivery. This seems to be a pattern of SABC incompetence with live streaming which can be blamed on something spurious. same as the dirty insulators blamed when load shedding started. enca is working fine in the other window.
Kyle Kleynhans,its just very slow which makes it difficult o pay attention
Willie Makena,The surname suits
Abele Maketsi,eeeeee
Syug,As chair he allowed the president and minister to encroach on his powers Eskom funded the ANC dinner? Yours and my money Luyanda is giving the money to the ANC

Dorothea Κarapurtzidou,No body talk about injuries and victims and victimisation again and again. the power abuse and transperancy of statutory bodies around Europe? . Police administration and individuals cases? Justice?
L Alexander,I personally don't see what's wrong with Eskom sponsoring some ANC events. It can have a direct impact on increasing your profits. "If there are influential businesses and corporations attending the function "Explain how it's a conflict of interest guys "No I don't object to that at all. The DA for example hosts many functions with leading business role players Why do companies sponsor events? "Yeah "@Mike Clark Haha "You see? Zondo is explaining it nicely here *Deputy Chief Justice 😉 "Exactly "People say if you saw something wrong I've been busy refreshing my page all this time
Sibongile Maputi,I am not sure how Tsotsi is gonna answer the question on the table. The ANC must answer. Why do SOEs find it appropriate to sponsor events of a political party?
Velile Ndlovu,@Luyanda - whose profits are U referring to? Eskom has been making losses every year for the past 2 decades @ least!!
Salome Seabi,"ramaphosa knew all the time about corruption but did nothing He is just playing with our minds "BY law the witness is on the corner now anc gala dinner is alwas a breeding ground for massive corruption to follow Seems he cant see a way out of the corner yes sabc is always a problem yeeeeees political party n i b the president yoyoyo this 1 looks to be a crook par excellence big 1 very surprising Tsotsi is a cinfident liar confident yeb ceryl is not clean at all @Gala u r right @Mokadi that is the point ba tlo motshwara o yeb definetely he pocketed some money Anyo the gupta brothers is a mafiane who had a cordial meeting at saxonworld with jo computer
