Quinton van Eeden,salaam infidels 🤣 "fact remains - as a qualified lawyer and company secretary @Lerato Moleke - the evidence thus far does not suggest participation on her part - methinks she was simply in a job too big for her @Heather Durr 🌹 @Stix Mtolo 🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Stix Mtolo - his passing leaves the door open for him to now become the fall guy in this sorry saga @Mzwanele shange 🤜 @SABC News - then why is eNCA up and running? @Cooler Cat - Majavu is top drawer only problem with the eNCA feed is the nonsensical banner updates @hirsitus 👍 @TW Ntshingila - don't agree - Arden in NZ is doing a great job - so did Margaret Thatcher @TW Ntshingila - then I'll let the likes of Min Naledi Pandor take you to task 🤣 - you're on your own here "@TW Ntshingila - is Peters an utterly useless individual - yes @TW Ntshingila - then we are ad idem 🙂 @TW Ntshingila 🤣 Majavu giving Soni pointers on how to lead a witness - he should give him a copy of Colman on Cross-Examination @Immanuel - maybe his clients did not have winnable cases in the first place - I judge a lawyer on his knowledge and practice of the law and collegiality - Majavu is a class act - Mpofu a showboater Soni must simply ask her direct closed-ended questions - Majavu will object if he feels it is unfair also did the 123 123

"Oh right @S V 1 @Van Rural Boy - oh yes! Now I remember 😆 unbelievable! @Aubrey De Bliquy - so true! The lockdown is killing more people through poverty & starvation than Covid ever will = ANC government! Mr Soni is one smart cookie - he is leading her nicely to expose her lies. DCJ is weaving a web to catch her out as well. @Aubrey De Bliquy - 100% The biggest scamdemic of all times! The politicians around the world have had a taste of totalitarian rule & they just want to increase their control & power! @John Everitt 👍 "Let's have a meeting about a meeting about a meeting & 2 years later "@Louis C - I know he was an ANC member before he was appointed DCJ If she is not guilty then she wouldn't need counsel to interject on her behalf. DCJ & the EL see through her tactics! He is trying to be far too nice when it's not for real. All he is actually doing is trying to avoid his client telling the truth. I love it when they refer to themselves in the 3rd person! @Sal SA - exactly 🙂 🙂 ! It is too much @DieVet Eierrr - she is saying Dipuo - speaking about heself in the 3rd person @Maritime Studies - were you at varsity with Mr Soni? "If you know your people rely on trains @Louis C - What do you mean? and 10% into cadre pockets @Tommygun - what a combination!! "More jobs for friends - 65 executives!! Unbelievable.

There has to be a coalition so that the ANC can't dominate & override all opposition parties. * definitely Who is this woman? Was she the whistle-blower? She was the former head of Legal at Prasa Just a pity that whistle blowers are villified & shunned! It shows you that the current PRASA Board is still corrupt!

Quick in he's worried what she will say as she rambles on The less she says the better for her  the only reason personal notes is to refer to if ever needed to know exactly what happened so no why do you lose them I have notebooks 10 years old just in case  no way  I don't remember if I lied to parliament  As minister the buck stops with you that's why you are paid those huge salaries  Ethical matters are not of concern because they get in the way of the brown paper packets The country started to go down at the point when it was not realised that excellent freedom fighters were not necessarily able to run a country So major positions became rewards instead of jobs  There should have been found other ways to reward those who sacrificed for freedom and not allow their inabilities and believe of being owed to bring down the country @Maritime Studies yesterday we learnt the such cabinet involvement is actually against the law  "She has proved herself to be incompetent @Tommygun you under estimate the level of politics in a church council. That is cut throat  morning pastor Instead of more taxes tommorow CR should cut the number of ministers dep ministers and cut their expenses I know but you have to hope  We need a state were laws and country direction were the responsibly of an elected parliament.

"Cadre deployment is the reason why we have zero service delivery. Oh No "The ""Engineer"" that purchased the tall trains can be the Head of all Government procurement.....hahaha" "The Fake Train engineer Mthimkhulu did not have a single qualification "Daniel Mthimkhulu "Hang on "No "Remember that for most of the questions asked by the Evidence Leader Why would a State President be interested in a temporary appointment in a SOE? Dipuo Peters Ex Transport Minister The Zupta ANC can then join with their Youth League the EFF and become the Opposition. There we can see them for what they are. The Young people in the ANC go to the Political School where the corrupt ANC old people will teach them the ANC way? CongratulationsAnd celebrationsWhen I tell everyone She will not answer that Chair! It took her 2 years to do all that? @Kwazi Buthelezi Agree with your comments.

The evidence leader is unfair with this line of questioning.....she will give the information as supplementary evidence. "@Previous Nkopodi : Bongo the chairperson of portfolio of home affairs in the current administration...remember Bongo is alleged to have ""bribed"" Adv Vanara during parliamentary investigation on eskom" @Lerato Moleke : it will appear to me that the net is closing on so many guys who were too complicit in rendering their services while in public office....  it appears to me that most guys in the executive were taking advantage of Zuma's lack of critical judgment  @Brightwell Kunene : i dont think everyone is incompetent.....problem is party loyalty and that narrative thanks to state capture is slowly dying

Lawyers refer back to previous cases as base to win current cases @charlie zamile I agree with you but what are supposed outcomes of both?

Kevin Simon,Zondo for PRESIDENT!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mzalwane Mzala,Charges were laid against Ms Myeni @Mr L  People are looking for anything to discredit this commission and its chairperson.
Barbara Sattler,I would rather be a tea girl at Prasa. At least I know I earned my salary honestly She was/is a Zuma informant "Last night at the commission ""investigate"" .The same today"

Jeff Maja,It is clear it was 9 years wasted years.
Norman Zwane,I liked how Zuma ends his meetings- he just keels over fall asleep and his ministers dismiss themselves. @Jeff Maja I like how some people see it otherwise. I have no idea what waste is for them. @Gerrit Van Schoor She has her athritic back against the wall.
Junior Mancinza,Yes you correct @Mzalwane Mzala
Danile Ngubenyathi,Dudu Myeni is attending a court case of which some of the things that are being said here on state capture are related to the case that she's attending. so for her to answer some of the questions here will jeopardize the case approaching a minister you don't remember who was he/her help help who's this now 🤔? hmm she's educated maan she came with a tablet @louis C we mustn't shy away paid by our money we are in crisis here in SA. all the parties are the ribs of ANC. others the likes of DA are there to oppose not to come up with new strategies to build SA instead they wait for ANC to flop

Aubrey De Bliquy,Just be truthful. That is always best. @Moonchild 100% We have slipped into a mindless totalitarian rule which is killing millions. We will not know if we are dying from COVID or Vaccines. @68 I take that personally. @Sal SA No rushed vaccine makes sense while banning a 35 year old Nobel prize winning pill the UN paid 2cents for under Obama respected by doctors as a 100% effective COVID inhibitor. "@Sal SA Under the current WHO dictatorship we will never know if the Virus or the Vaccine is killing us. This is the AIDS/HIV/ARV WHO scam all over again. AIDS kills 20 @Sal SA Anyone who tells you there is a tested Vaccine worthy of our trust under the present worldwide subservience to corporate sponsored who is a BOLD FACED LIAR. It is not bossible by definition. @Jabu Malinga 100% LOL Sitting in front of my PC doing nothing. LOL pity the pay sucks. Zuma is a Marxist. He doen't like Democracy unless he wins. Is the Commission mandate not just investigation? Surely the public prosecutor must decide to prosecute or not. 15% VAT is TAX everyone pays. @Thapelo Motabogi Would it not be a greater benefit to talk about what democracy can do to correct what Apartheid has done? We all know Apartheid was a stupid idea. How can we fix it that's not worse? Apparently the Military spent R150 million for medicine from Cuba to fight the COVID biological warfare and 40% went off because of the fridges losing power. Corruption kills and causes poverty. It is like pumping a tire with a nail in it. @Thapelo Motabogi Racism will unfortunately always be with us. It is our choice if we want a different path. @Thapelo Motabogi If speaking the truth is racist by your reckoning that is a distorted view of reality and intelligent conversation. @Thapelo Motabogi You just made yourself look stupid without correcting whatever I said you view as wrong but happy to smear me by associating me with people I do not know. That is ignorant. @Thapelo Motabogi Truth requires no justification. THere will always be racists. That does not mean I am one. I don't like it but I wont put my head in a hole like an ostrich as you do and pretend. "@Thapelo Motabogi Racists @Thapelo Motabogi You want to talk victim class and oppressor class puts you in the same mind fv<k as Marxist communist stooges who are surprised when they end up in the supposed opressor class. "@yoliswa mbebe We don't have to make a religion out of corruption. We arem ourselves to stop it firstly by exposiong it as the Commission is mandated to do. It si slow It seems like CODESA did not give us a representative democracy because the parties nominate parliament. So we end up with a party dictatorship. If Zuma liked democracy he could have changed the law to make his actions legal. The fact that he did not do so makes him look like an incompetent crook. @Sal SA Fiat money makes us all slave who think they are free. People spoke the truth while it risked their livelihood are the true heroes of this sorry story. Res ipsa loquitur (thing speaks for itself) is a doctrine in law that can infer negligence from the very nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved. Surely the ANC must see that corruption will undermine their own agenda for South Africans voters.

WareWolf,Morning all "Thabo Daniel your optimism is inspiring SA's future lies in the history of north african liberation countries The only thing we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history Your quality of life is how you are paying for all this mismanagement while we battle in the final two weeks of every month without cash. imagine if you had that tax money in your account We are all slaves to the system buy him a coke essentially we are funding the luxurious lifestyles of connected employees of the state "paying high fuel costs tax* Tax should be declared unconstitutional impractical Anyone who doesnt complain about high cost of living is the one who collects tax money take a case to the CC to declare tax unconstitutional. it dhould be altered to a system of donation rather than tax. you donate how much you can someone has to take this tax thing to court. im telling you theres a chance to win. "say for example i pay 5-7k tax pm where is it going except to pay jacob and duduzane how does it improve my enviroment? i see no improvements? i pay rates so they can pick up trash and cut the grass every six months our money that should be spent on feeding our schools improving hospitals so theres no queues and expensive machinery where is the money young people cant start businesses but theyre the ones with the skills and ideas to move is forward Dismantle parliament and appoint this commission in its place immediately When you have discipline then things will work running a country is not a part time job it takes all of us together dude many of us are born after apartheid. ALL WE SAW IN OUR LIFETIME IS THIS ANC "No We will get real work done Politicians only care about how famous they are junk status...thats where zuma (your president) took our country and dumped it Nyokas. Nyokas everywhere. wake up after all these years? unlikely. ANCorruption "if you remove anc who will replace more corrupt officials cant replace the ANCorruption each province should be given to the top parties for complete rule and this commission can monitor them this commission must trump all in SA This commission has separated the sheep from the wolves The whole political system is designed to fail. we dont need a million parties we only need 2. i commend those brave people who stood up and told the truth The voters dont realise they could have had bigger social grants if this stealing didnt occur This Commission will stop all the tricks "Nobody is saying dont steal the money. Steal if you are a dirty crook Thuli Madonsela must come back together with Musi Maimane and Zondo and lead this country "Cut the crap out Radical economic transformation brought to you by jakob Radical stealing People on the ground should not hold power over finance or requisitions ANC dont care about voters because the IEC is another puppet IEC must come and answer to this commission 70m people. 7million voters. If you cannot self correct then VACATE Any stats that government give you cant be trusted
