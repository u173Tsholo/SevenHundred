Great....it is all coming back now.? Mama Action is in trouble I think?? "As I listen to these hearings Colin....Thabo.....hehe "Agrizzi is a crook Gordhan thinks that he is too important to come to this commission to answer questions. This evidence leader and the Hulley guy needs to up their game! @Thobani Mkananda I agree with you. A fool can throw a stone into a pond that 100 wise men cannot get out
Tom,flowers or masserati once or less? It will come back It will come back today She remembers that she forgot a few times Toilets not maintenance?

"@Mthunzi Sibeko "They may have been Who's this Advocate by the way?

Not Mr Notshe 🤦🏾‍♂️ Judge Zondo has to question the witness himself because Mr. Notshe did the honorable thing and recused himself Adv Notshe is an embarrassment to the work of the commission.

Kgomarediyakokotane Nna,what is she saying entlek...🤔🤔
sello mokoka,The commissioner must be firm on these people as they are making a mockery of the commission since most of the things they don't remember or recall or it will come back. C She has been coached to be seen as someone who forgets.
peter sikoshule,I think she was supposed to simply answer questions. she is talking too much so she is not denying
Matolengwe Makongwana,"She is instructed to talk a lot Commission will need a week to question her She has lots of energy. She must relax "Ooops Her 83 year old mother is unfortunately identical to her...... "Once or twice or .....maybe all the time

RC Swart,feel sorry for this lady
Ayanda Sokhela,"Time wasting technique. Before we know it Shes already started digging a huge grave for Mokonyane. Watson gives presents to a Primier or MEC who then gives them contracts in government. Shes burning her and she doesnt even know it. Here we go😀😀😀 Lying through her teeth """You must have forgot to deny""😀😅😀" Surely there must be a register of who signed for the hamper upon delivery. She will be caught out if shes lying. @Sphamandla yes they can. Usually happens in Class action lawsuits Didnt she just deny that she knew about the installation of the CCTV cameras?
Salty Crack,Ask her closed questions that require a Yes or No response "If my memory serves me correctly "Ukuba inkumbulo yam indinceda ngokuchanekileyo Hamper was captured LOL@Theo van Zijl Ducking and Diving XYZ lol Just answer Yes or No Such a lyer Watching paint dry is more entertaining
Ronaldo Van Wyk,coloured culture😂
Tommygun,it was my birthday every other day Are we starting at the thin end of the corrution wedge here? Flowers and maybe a hamper worth 1500? So is the objective here to get info to incriminate Mokonyane or is Ms Sandy Thomas accused personaly? Rather irregular way of dispersing charity "@Antoinette Meyer bamg on extended patronage network
Colleen Arezio,really? is her birthday so important. How can anyone expect honest testimony when she is using her bosses lawyers for State Capture since 2019? This is ridiculous.
Gsh Chf,:thanksdoc::thanksdoc::thanksdoc:รักทุกท่าน
Alvino Theunissen,Respect Everyone here all cultures
Neil Fraser,Surely the flowers being sent must come through her office to the minister? Very vague - she can’t give one definite answer. "@sphamandla - they can I’m sooo glad she’s not my secretary. Listen how clearly she can recall these issues.

Neil Paterson,"Her own file? Like I say "It's not guaranteed that ""it will come back"" during the course of today's proceedings" "Everything will ""come back to me"" during the lunch debriefing with her counsel"
