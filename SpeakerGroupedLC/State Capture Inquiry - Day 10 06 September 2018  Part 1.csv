The submission that they presenting here. is that a closing argument? are they still going to call more witness or what? Thank you @Steemit OneAzania... Who is this man standing? and who is he representing? I thought so... but i'm not sure @Steemit OneAzania Is this man from Dubai or SA? his also been Captured by Zupta too@Steemit OneAzania I think that will be fare too @Steemit OneAzania . but also they need to call Ajay Gupta and hi brother to come testify and call Jacob Zuma too. dont you think so Steemit? No one will be arrested. @Norman Zwane. What happen at Life Esidimeni. No one was arrested instate they Dr Cedani Mahlangu was elected back to her duty. Yes @Steemit OneAzania. I personally don''t see where is this inquiry is taking us to. The question i have is that what happen at Life esidimeni where by more that 100 people die under Cedani Mahlangu I think the only way to get people arrested its only when people can appear in court of Law. That we can say yes people will be arrrested. @Steemit OneAzania Then this is a waist of money and time @Steemit OneAzania Thank you @Steemit OneAzania . Do you perhaps know if today will have someone to testify or tomorrow? They started at 10:00am and just now they go for tea time. Coffee @kenneth mampa 😁😁😁😁😁 @kenneth mampa. Thank you will be waiting. LOL.....@Steemit OneAzania here it come. Tea time. Why these Guptas dont want to come and clear up their names. ? They dont want to be physical appear to an Inquiry. "So if they did not do anything @bonnie mazzie. They Gupta are disrespecting SA and its Law. This Advocate is been captured as well. This is logic. How on earth have someone appear in court or Inquiry via video link?

Louis Ntuli,Is not this the same lawyer who represented JZ recently?
Norman Zwane,@kenneth mampa don't you think it is presuming too much to pre-judge another human being state emotion? "@kenneth mampa I do not disagree with your view that ""he is not fit to chair this commission"" "@kenneth mampa Ah well maybe you know the judge that much more than I do. In which case I have no argument. If you do not "@kenneth mampa Whilst you are entitled to your own opinions may draw a blank here. The accuser's version must be tested. But the implicated must also their version across as well. @Bronx Wavy I doubt if Faith has a version since Pottenger is no more. @Thando Nkutha You so right! "@Desmond Masilela The judge Moseneke almost pleaded with our NPA to prosecute the Qedanis @Steemit OneAzania So you following this whitewash by choice. Why? @Steemit OneAzania Each to their own.

hub.grasstruths,Hello Africans and Americans 😃 what do we say - will this inquiry allow cross examinations or just nice and polite examinations? @Desmond Masilela the establishment doesn't want to allow cross examinations because it will kick up too many names they want to hide thats why we are having an inquiry not an inquest or a trial All witnesses should be allowed to be cross examined @Desmond Masilela I think the publisc will support the commissioner denying cross examination - this wouid be unfortunate. The establishment wants us to buy the narrative of blaming foreigners.. "@Desmond Masilela It's  "@Desmond Masilela a cross examination may call into question the honesty of a witness @Desmond Masilela I believe he is a lawyer and his submission is calling for the opportunuty tyo cross examine a witness It seems ridiculous that anyone should have to submit an argument for something so obvious This submission will be denied. Itis a means to swep the real story under a rug @Desmond Masilela most definitely - A prosecuting authority should bbuild a case against them and prove it in a court. Instead of this silly inquiry "When an expert witness under corss examination is shown to have been coached to give testimony in favor of the state for instance @Desmond Masilela my brother - we are the same in questioning that this is a whitewash just like the esidimeni inquiry No one can be captured unless their minds are weak. These guys sold the people out. Simple. Capture is an excuse @Norman Zwane just like you I follow it. Would you like me to stop following it? "If his submission wins the day @Desmond Masilela that's correct. The prosecuting authority doesnt want to build a case against their own people @Thando Nkutha do you want me to go eat curry and be quiet too? 😃 @Desmond Masilela it is a waste of our time and money - but it serves the establishment very well. so they will spare no costs They need this inquiry so they can argue they ware not pressing charges because there is an inquiry "@makhosi nobhatyi this is the nail you hit on th head sir - the fact is "everyone who comes here is like the people in church gupta saw and opportunity - a country being led by sellouts. of course he climbed in. the people are now looking for his head butthe guys who gave the keys to him - they will vote for them it's a charade like the trc and esideimeni and every other inquiry so far. "meanwhile @makhosi nobhatyi these guys minds are captured by greed. thats the only capture here. its like I give my keys to a gangsterthen claim my car is hijacked LOL @Enoch Dipela the people in charge should have gone straight to jail while we make a case againstthem @makhosi nobhatyi these lawyers here - 50%o f them and 50% of the journalists will be in parliament in ten years time thgis gentleman is making strong arguments - the question is WHY a notion of capture and not - they are sellouts cheers people mayibuye

makhosi nobhatyi,This guy is trying to delay the proceedings of commission of inquiry All we want people to testify even the one whom may be implicated must come to the commission to say their version "Why they want to cross examine witnesses but they don’t want to say their story? Country has no money "Steemit I understand brother Gupta won’t come here Steemit Zuma and his buddies hide behind the laws and it clear that state capture is real happened All we know lawyers lie a lot as politicians "Jonathan please you must not be negative this will help country moving forward not being blinded those who claim they fight for poor but for themselves  Guys marikana things we butter Ramaphosa who was in charge then in government isn’t Zuma? Have Zuma ever went to marikana? All CR was saying no more killings after those whom killed by strikers "Ntuthuko we can’t allowed that happen in front of us Makhosi khoza was strictly strong in view held officials accountable after she said Zuma must go and she was hunted "Norman Zwane I know wat you say it is because of people like Zuma and his allies "ANC was too afraid to face truth look where we are now? Still they want to use Zuma in election campaigns am lost here Gupta knew exactly that will be arrested denial of laws This must just shut up now this is nonsense Hawks and NPA was changed by them and former president Am so disappointed with you South Africa by supporting the Gupta in wat they say about state that is mess so what they are trying to say to the world about us Zuma will fall in the same stance as Guptas Time wasted yeses If Gupta pleaded guilty would they come to served their sentence? "Michael Holmes there no radical transformation here Zuma Zuma hired people who will broke the laws so that he can use as counter part All they will refuse to testify only wants to cross examine witnesses These people surely have study this but they don’t want to corporate
Phillip Cwazibe,This hearing should have been a full blown high court case where the jury would arrive at guilty or innocent verdict.
Tulonga Henoch,Does this lawyer want to argue that no money was stolen from the country? Is the Judge breathing okay?
Enoch Dipela,"How much Joseph? let it be calculated first What is playing now is just ideological games... "problem with people losing faith in these commissions is that there have never been consequences Maybe we need to give them the benefit of doubt this time around because they are aware of the impact of state capture and looting that has and continuing to take place in our country. They (Guptas)claim that the very Hawks and NPA that they captured is now incompetent. Exactly my point King... The man is really trying his best..

Nkululeko Gcwensa,Why everything has to be about race? White or Black lawyer who cares? What is important is the merit or substance of arguments put forward.
