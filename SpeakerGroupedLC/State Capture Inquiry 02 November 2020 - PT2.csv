Very disappointing @Naledi Barron @Pastor J.J - I used to think so as well but our budget deficit skyrocketed out of control while he was at SARS.

I don't like racists of any colour. @Teddy Teddy - feel free to contact the commission with the information you have then. They have asked people to come forward with evidence & then you won't feel discriminated against. @Johnno D - clearly! @Sabelo Nxumalo - we all have enemies but we all need to stop playing the victim & take responsibility for our own lives. There is no systemic racism in SA. @Val Speirs - hear hear!! @Cerebis - exactly!!! I couldn't have put it better myself. "@Ndumie Ndlovu - playing the race card again.

Fifi,brilliant question 're the legal questions I still don't understand why these witnesses have hired Ms Mbanjwa "keeping quiet She doesn't know why she resigned? 😳 This is a 1st! Not remembering why one resigned from a board Yes Kate But I hear both sides of the argument Holding off from resigning could be seen as an act of defiance What is she saying 😵😵 😩😩😩😩 What is she going on about?? 🤣🤣🤣 Our queen FFS Yhu Can someone please bring me up to speed re the vetkoek analogy Can someone please bring me up to speed re the vetkoek analogy DCJ is forever sighing whenever Ms Mbanjwa speaks then what was she basing her decision on? So Ms Kwinana is part of the RET forces betrayed the country 🤣🤣🤣 Imagine what her poor kids must be thinking watching their mother being ripped to shreds like this didn't meet the minimum requirements Can we lodge a claim to get these board members fees paid over reimbursed to National Treasury? I understand why Mbanjwa & Kwinana are acquainted Wow! such incompetence and ignorance Yes Kate! Shapa thupa What did I just listen to? Mbanjwa advising Hofmeyer 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Poor Ms Mtshe should come back to defend herself The Chair is going to swear at the witness at this ratw 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 What question is she answering Ms Mshe must sue Ms Kwinana But she's not listening to the question.

Zalisile Ndzala,Mr. Linel again. Eskom as well But you can attend operational management meetings So Mr. Linel was babysitting the SAA kindergarten of SAA board members. Ceteris Paribus. Do you meet with bidders as a decision maker? But she can influence the supply chain decision It's called 'Rent-seeking'. If she wants to sing. Let her sing. She did well cancelling that tender. She is correct. But you were running operations too. You went to management meetings "But DCJ She is cheeky

She is trying to justify her unlawful actions. 😂😂@Pastor J.J "Lies The evidence leader forced ...... Wow! @Phakamile Khuzwayo Definitely 😂😂😂😂@Akhonamandla Gala @That Falla It was an analogy that Kwinana gave and she used the word fat cakes rather than vetkoek.

It should be scrapped Irrelevant examples she is giving "From today I am a CA She came with a Peruvian hair and now Zondo and the evidence leader have turned her hair into a perm Mbanjwa loves being on the spotlight Disishin Meikha Black leadership is a problem.

Dumile Mateza,She nailed her just there I would have done the same. Fired you for your incompetence Shw acrually aware where this question is leading. To her meetings with Sipho Ndzeku. Sthathiso this money used for the Comission is nothing compared to the money we lost with state capture. Like Board fees to people who cannot even express themselves like this one and many others. I was told when you are giving evidence. You do not volunteer information as she does. She is worried about job losses because of a tender that she cancelled an gave to Airchefs. But because of her actions and other board members we do not have an SAA This is a real attitude of a Rakgadi She is running away from questions around the Ndzeku contract. That is exactly what I had in mind Advocate Hofmeyer was going to the Ndzeku contract.

She would not be there if someone just as incompetent never put her there. She is talking down to everyone as if they are all stupid. I think this would be more fun with a few whiskys She was a rubber stamp for decisions made elsewhere. Is anyone surprised these SOEs hae been stripped to the point of collapse? back to the vetcakes It would be funny if it was not such a suicide of SOE's "It's not ANC's prestige carrier Her demeanor is either BS or bully.

Judge Zondo That was her big word of the week @Sirshin Moodliar 🤣🤣🤣🤣 This is why they were in shambles. They were suppose to know the details when they awarded the tender SAA 957 employees per aircraft compared to Quantas 129 employees per aircraft. Fatcakes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 That is the reason Comair / Kulula took their aircraft maintenance elsewhere Now the truth comes out. The children had to be put in place Chartered account ant New nickname for SOE looters..... Fat cakes @Ty Lopes ... she has court case against her for not paying for the Mercedes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Now Vetkoek wants to pick and choose @Trevor Arosi ... she is chartered account ant @Donald Mokwakwa ... She did not pass .... she tendered for it and got it Judge Zondo....... Focus sir Sorry Your Honor She only signs Fat Cakes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Baking Powder.... more like gunpowder What is the answer..... Fat Cakes @Bill West 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Correct Judge Zondo had to leave before he loses his mind Shine bright like a diamond "Real fatcakes are made with yeast and patience. This vetkoek used baking powder News 24 headline tonight.. Fat cakes and tenders mixed salad 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😀🤣 She can safely be added to the growing list of delinquent SA boardmembers ANC headquarters renamed as LuBoelie house Messaging ESCOM.... Switch it OFF now Phone a friend She is ordering ESCOM to switch off the lights..... the Fat Cake is done We paid for Vetkoek tjat The rest of hard working SA must retire at 60 but the crooks go on to loot We are a welfare state @That Falla She answers almost all of the questions with a Fat Cake recipe with baking powder She has not read it because she does not agree with it @That Falla . I agree with you 100%. Problem is these retired expired pirates keeps the educated talent out of the looting pool Retrenchment happens when a company or unit is not financially viable. So now you know why SAA is bankrupt year after year. @Naledi Barron 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Fabian Moodley 🤣 @Phakamile Khuzwayo ... Well said. "@Fabian Moodley .

I agree 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 They flew SAA into the ground @Gwen Maluleke ... Spoton How did I miss what 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Joel is fishing @Naledi Barron 🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Bhekie Sibiya . He was not responsible.... end of story Her lawyer is suppose to focus but she is alsolutely lost Tell her Judge. It is not her job to educate you on your very own client From now on I will make sure to only appoint foreign accountants as well as lawyers They have broken two professions today Ms Hoffmeyer you are on fire We are now boarding ... please proceed to Vetkoek gate @greatnation69 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Dan the Lion is using bait to trap you in his senseless blabber She will be off sick tomorrow Ignore the Lion.... he is roaring up the wrong tree @Mzalwane Mzala ...

Freddie Van Rhyn,no wonder our soe's are in deep s... t in appointing idiots like this as boardmembers and chaipersons Kate Hofmeier is pulling this witness to pieces. How could SAA or the minister ever appoint an incompetent CA like this she is going to talk a stiff drink now lol I wonder if she will ever get a job again. maybe selling vetkoek she was a lazy board member who did not read her e/mails or momos. she just rubberstamped whatever her paymasters told her to sign ie she was a negligent in doing her job with a lawyer that is representing this witness. No wonder Zuma is losing one case after the other. since he does not have white lawyers representing him anymore. I pity Zuma when his time comes for the Zondo commission. and Julius Malema makes use of white lawyers to defend him
thulani fadashe,They wined and dined in Chicago It’s going down at Zondo Hebethuna This miss Kwinana has balls of a baffalo 😆😆😆😆 I knew she had something tangible She’s giving hard cold facts They are dealing with animal today 😂😂 Hahahahaha I don’t trust you Zondo 😂😂😁 She’s not going to say otherwise just because they don’t understand her vantage point. They can go jump 😆😆 this lady was preventing making a foreign company rich on South African soil. "i like her Zondo must not threaten this lady. his overreaching now. doesn't matter it's still a foreign company. "this lady was fighting for the livelihood of a South African Company threatened by those who sought contracts on behalf of foreign competition. Shame on them she did not have to. that's impuning on a witness character. it is not your job to tell her what she is. she knows very well. So at Zondo com they don't want to here her side of the story.
