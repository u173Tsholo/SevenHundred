Edward Grosvenor,The witness has both Zondo and Hurley around his finger. he is controlling
Roy Kisten,they should also have a body language specialist in the commission to see weather this idiot is lying no chance for Alli shame for Alli
Arthur Dell,Roy Kirtsen we all can see he is lying!!! Martin you that 100% right Gert he has much too much patience!!
Marcus Mmola,"The witness knows his story  "Apologies
Martin van der Breggen,I thought this was not going to take long.....Nyathi has verbal dihorrea Time for being civil is over - answer the bloody questions And we have not even started on the Secure in Comfort report yet
Craig Johnson,"No wonder nothing happens in government "As Shaggy once said @Kerry van Schalkwyk yes it is. The lies are the same though Clearing throat is a sign of not telling the truth as his throat starts tightening up. The police service is a joke "Blame blame blame take take take kill kill kill steal steal steal "Unemployment is at 50% this year 65% unemployment for youth ANC = black privilege. " @Mpotseng Lebentlele go stay on a farm and fear for your life "Public servant Who serves the public in the ANC "@Hubert Maphumulo  When we all learn to live together. The ANC create this divide "RACE CARD "Who here is really and truly racist Stockholm syndrome noun feelings of trust or affection felt in many cases of kidnapping or hostage-taking by a victim towards a captor. "At what point do we stop blaming the past and start blaming the real criminals Every person incriminated in this commision has a tie with the ANC. Say much??? I hope that this crap 26 year legacy sits on everyone's minds the same way it has apartheid. This will be in the history books for our future generation to study. "Just a reminder "Divide and conquer "Yus if we actually changed our mindset and decided to rebuild this country @Kerry van Schalkwyk ditto I pay my taxes too and employ 3 people who rely on their pay packet which feeds their family. üòÄüòÄüòÄ @Mpotseng Lebentlele lame argument
StarManRSA,"""Everything I did wasn't actually me @Marcus Mmola this is not a court of law @Alvino Theunissen how is Zondo protecting Nhleko?
Dominic Przybylski,collective irresponsibility Sounds like he did no work at all. Gupta This man is acting guilty as sin. @Marcus Mmola It would be such a pleasure to see the judge walk over to witness and give him a snot clap whenever he wastes time or doesn't answer a question properly... afternoon fantasy. "Does anyone know who was in the ""reference group""?" @Cerebis It's frustrating. I wonder how Nugent would have handled this commission. Perhaps Zondo should be wearing black leather with chains and a sjambok and give the witness a whipping every now and then. Why hide when nobody ever gets prosecuted? He seems to have avoided doing any work or taking any responsibility at all... Now that's not a crime but surely this kind of person should never be a cabinet minister. "2nd report indicates a revision of 1st report. Then obvious question is ""Why has the report been revised?""" So did you ask that question Mr Nhleko? It seems he plans to bore everybody to the point where they no longer ask him any more questions without the danger of dying of old age while in the same room. """All conditions for SAA rescue plan have now been met He didn't make anything of it because he was sleeping. "Once majority of people rely on corruption to survive a corrupt government becomes essential to them Nhleko is going to drag this out and Zondo is letting him do it. "A lot of the problems are due to a massive increase in population. Population was 12 million when I first went to school @Pienaar van Wyk Mbeki is responsible for 300 000 deaths due to his AIDS denialism. He believed it was anti-black propaganda Until our politicians accept responsibility as individuals we will be stuck with corruption and the poverty it propagates. @Craig Johnson Heh in this country the public are servants of public servants. @Cerebis I suspect that day will only come once we have all died from starvation. To identify people primarily by race can only be honestly done by people who identify themselves primarily by race. That is what a racist is. I feel sorry for them. @Zuptas have shipped their wealth to Dubai long ago. I travel by bicycle - carbon neutral. "@Kevin SANPARKS is asking for people to go cull hundreds of ostriches and thousands of warthogs because there are too many. Far too many humans Zondo is blindsiding his evidence leader. "I think most people don't care about the race of their role models whether it is in music
Ernestine Groepies-Larey,witness has an attitude üò° true gert
Xolisa Ndevu,this person is arrogant
Richard Masigo,Arrogance won‚Äôt work here he must answer
Gabisile Mahlangu,So arrogant! @Peet Venter Very Hot! üòÖüòÖüòÖ "Why is Zondo trying to play nice with this guy
Craven Morehead,Dodging questions and showing arrogance Zondo must put him in his place Looks a lot better the enca stream is horrible What is this chit chat about really? Lol now he sounds very guilty More friendly chats Can we get back to work? Really Zondo this is wasting time
Moonchild,@Craven Morehead - hope the syncing is better here üôÇ ! This Nhleko is ducking & diving & Judge Zondo is being too accommodating. Deflect all the time!!! He's trying to creat rapport between him & Zondo & then pull the wool over his eyes. I sincerely hope Zondo can see through this!!! He continually will not answer the question in a straightforward way!!! This is really irritating now & I'm getting angry. @Gift Mazibuko - absolutely agree "It's also very frustrating for the evidence leader You can hear that even Zondo is bored with this long-winded testimony! This is really a comedy of errors! They spent most of the day sorting out the pagination instead of getting on with the testimony! Now they are talking about food!!! I can't anymore. @Mpotseng Lebentlele - I agree but he needs to be more assertive now & enforce Nhleko to get on with it & answer the questions directly. @Mpotseng Lebentlele - hope so üôè @Bophelo Malapela - I think he needs to be more assertive with Nhleko who has been ducking & diving to avoid answering to the charges. "@Bophelo Malapela - if you don't know what assertive means @Bophelo Malapela - not at all. It is merely a question of him guiding this witness to answer the charges succinctly & directly. Nhleko is skirting the issues & we the tax-payers are paying for it. @Mpotseng Lebentlele @Bophelo Malapela - I won't dignify those comments with a response. "@Mpotseng Lebentlele - agreed & I was not being disrespectful @Mike Mike - nothing ever seems to change. "@Mike Mike - one solution is voting them out of power "@Monique‚Äôs Makeup - that's a bit of a difficult one as no political party is perfect by any means. I think the best option would be a coalition of the DA @Monique‚Äôs Makeup - bye!

We are all South Africans & are entitled to live in the country of our birth. "@Sal Abdulla - yes you are right "@Bophelo Malapela - the Nats were a terrible racist regime & apartheid was a crime against humanity but the point of democracy was supposed to be the end of racism "The fact of the matter is that the ANC has ensured @Pienaar van Wyk - agreed "@Mpotseng Lebentlele - Cry The Beloved Country. If you can't see that then I'm not sure where you are living. I want us to uplift this country together @Mpotseng Lebentlele - don't show your ignorance & disrespect by playing that card! It doesn't work with me. "@Pienaar van Wyk - exactly right "@Pienaar van Wyk - you are wasting your knowledge on certain people here as they don't want to see facts "@MIKE DURBAN - yes @Mpotseng Lebentlele - if the cap fits .... @Mpotseng Lebentlele - ü§£ you are hysterical. You don't have a clue what you are talking about but ignorance is bliss! "@Mpotseng Lebentlele - I know exactly what you said @Kevin - and alcohol "@Mpotseng Lebentlele - by the way who is ""we""?" @Mpotseng Lebentlele - let's be clear - I said apartheid was a racist regime & very wrong. I then said 1994 was supposed to be the start of our new democracy without racism - that has not happened "@Bophelo Malapela - I'm sorry to hear that @Bophelo Malapela - please give me an example? "@Pienaar van Wyk - yip @Pienaar van Wyk - called the NDR - socialism & communism is the path we are on. "@Mpotseng Lebentlele - ha ha @Mpotseng Lebentlele - you are talking about yourself I'm afraid. "@Pienaar van Wyk - and eating their pets & sand to survive! Look at Venezuela & the poverty & starvation in Zim "@Singi Mathebula - that is my point @Craig Johnson - exactly. Divided by racist ANC politicians as well as the likes of the EFF. Just remember that other countries who were colonised have become extremely properous & economically wealthy eg Singapore. It took them far less than 26 years & no excuses. They just got on with it. @Bophelo Malapela - I am talking about colonisation. I didn't say apartheid. Please look at the facts once again. Do your research. @Craig Johnson - awesome. @Kevin - so true!!üòÉ @Mpotseng Lebentlele - you still didn't tell me what contribution you are making to uplift SA for the benefit of all??

Bruce Thackwell,what an embarrassment to have a person like this in a senior government post. He has nothing but contempt. hehe Zondo knows who pays the bills what a bla bla bla cover up Never forget the trillions that have been defrauded from the South African Tax payer. trained by the Chinese Zondo comes across a scared of him lives for lunch "The land of thieves and reports and cadres  Just swell up and explode on custard.

Always to the lowest common denominator
Cerebis,The fire pool guy is so arrogant because he knows he will walk Scot free from this whole thing. He is protected by Ace and his gang. Again with the stupid jokes.....eish Zulu to Zulu jokes??? Was his water blessed by the so called Doom guy? Why can this commission not deliver interim reports so that the NPA can start prosecutions? @Dominic Przybylski Jip! He would and did issue interim reports in the SARS commission. I wonder how many trees this commission has used up with all these files? @Dominic Przybylski Agree! My view is that the total collapse has started and there is no stopping it because of your first comments in your post. He was the fire pool minister Thomas @Mpotseng Lebentlele Go to Australia if you have a problem in South Africa. Why you say this? We can wait and have some tea if we like "@Hubert Maphumulo But Hubert @Bophelo Malapela Agree! But the new SA surely has it's fair share of criminals @Hubert Maphumulo Jip.....Like the Chinese? "@Bophelo Malapela It is unfortunately not only looting......Murder is sky high @Bophelo Malapela Every group in SA is being murdered.....58 a day currently. That is the sad truth. wasting your time and energy arguing with these people. The day will come when all oppression of the people in this country will end.

Bophelo Malapela,The nonsense on this platform questioning the integrity of DCJ Zondo because people do not understand legal processes is shocking This is a commission not a court @Gabisile Mahlangu how would you expect DCJ Zondo to behave next he will be accused of not being fit to be a judge as did Lucky Montana @kerry van Schalkwyk you have your own perceptions of how DCJ Zondo should conduct himself care to share @kerry van schalkwyk define assertive @kerry van schalkwyk from your meltdown I get the distinct impression you have no clue why nhleko is before the commission It‚Äôs nhlehos own problem is he refuses to answer questions as that might comeback to haunt him Nhleko is here responding to allegations made by McBride against him he does not have to give answers we like Let‚Äôs watch and learn. The fire pool has no relevance here "McBride came to the commission and alleged that this issue of reports and werksmans attorneys was State capture Dramat and Sibiya lost their jobs because of this renditions nonsense.
