Eslon Eslon,who's Buti Kompela? "@Michael Michael So Gavin Watson never put his signature on any of the Bosasa documents while he was the CEO? Will Gavin Watson ever come to testify? I think Cyril panicked when the Bosasa payment was brought in parliament. He lied blindly. "@Thando Nkutha Dudu Myeni's only to Agrizzi's allegations was that he's a bitter racist and anti-woman The state must give this guy impunity for being a crucial whistle blower at the state capture commission really Zondo enjoying every moment with Agrizzi "Zondo must help the country from the heartless ANC leaders who almost destroyed one of the biggest of economy of the continent "@Thando Nkutha "jerrrr this Agrizzi guy is coughing everything Is Jiba implicated again? The other witness I would want to hear his story is former IPad boss Mcbride "@NiniMoiloa it will be interesting to hear him "Quinton Jacobs Did he say they paid for sona or it my ears plz help me guys? "@Yandi Masina So it's safe to say that Sona after parties Bosasa paid included opposition politicians as well? "@Marvel Ramatshela
Rengqu Tulani,brother of Steve kompela MEC this guy is very clever how you remember all of these things where happening woooow Did he say Magashule
Ntombethemba Manase,"Elson Yes Makhosi. And he said that boldly. But he is Isihlahla. "Cyril is not yet implicated "Carnoth Masuthu refused to be corrupted. "Yep Caroth "Pheladi maybe he did "No its not Ace Magashule "Yes I agree Pheladi Funicans 😁😁😁 ulwimi oluyinyani njengoAgrizzi. "Brigette Yes Ramaphosa is very weak because he never agreed to be corrupted. Me too Philani. I hope he gets the best lawyers. "Tea break I saw the name this morning Ben Cole. There he goes Ben Cole. He is alive and kicking. Has the ANC granted the leave to cross-examine Agrizzi? Vongani I disagree with you. It is just that we have not heard Gupta's Agrizzi. A person who was hands on. Otherwise the Guptas are worse. "Zondo for President ANC must come forward and tell us who from the TOP 6 received the bribe money. I suspect certain individuals received without the knowledge of others. "Quintin I am talking about the millions that were mentioned here yesterday that were received by the top 6. Not 500K Top six of Zuma Quintin "Quintin Why were not arrested? "Makhosi that is why I say they must come and tell us who exacty received the money "Mr Mateza "Matthew
Ntombie Nkosi,yho Ku bird I'm voting EFF! not because they are innocent themselves but because the ANC is disgusting
Cerebis,Wow Cedric Frolick....Buti Kompela.....the list is too long! Do the ANC have a breeding program to produce all these corrupt people? Hlaudi should become the president! Of the tea club at Pollsmoor prison. At all the airports Cheeky Watson....from the anti apartheid hero rugby player.....to this??? Cheeky refused to accept a Springbok place Watson Criminal Enterprise....Hope Puke Luke Watson is not involved??? Thanks Madelein. Correction accepted. Have blocked the movie troll SABC is using this tea time to check out who on line has not paid their TV licence?? "Agrizzi is a very bad crook I think the sounds come from Cloudy trying to get into his old office????😀😁😂🤣😃 Agrizzi has a nice house in Italia. Sorry away some time....Who is this Kevin please? Wow.....The JSE Wakeford?? I see Kevin is on Special leave now! Please leave Chris Hani out of this issue!! sona = state of the nation address by the President Magda....only Blue label.....no chicken legs...lol You can all vote for however you want to......and it will be ok! It is your right as a citizen.
Musa Bakiti,Gavin Watson clever one @Michael Michael no stupid can create such net of criminals This inquiry exposes how stupid we black people are when it comes to choose leaders @Lyle Johannes we need to add books of the bible with Agrizzi truth Mr Watson you have held that Agrizzi still has insider Gavin Watson packed the money not for me @Joel Mzayidume He is one of criminals Shame our ANC Did he just said Zuma? Agrizzi Remember Zulu letter EFF makes sense to black people only @Thama Printhouse 😂😂😂😂 Please give Agrizzi HIV He has killed ANC died Chair ask him if he ever kissed Nomvula Jeff Radebe is already in South Sudan to steal more In South Africa no one can win lotto only ANC members and their famillies Jesus do something to ANC No to EFF because the going to take the land of my boss and my boss is going be poor.

Mxolisi Gumbi,Vividly seem to be the word They shot him😂 We can hear you Chairman😂 its Q Bhana
Isihlahla Samabhinca,What was Gavin Watson's position at Bosasa ?? that Man is very clever but he appears in everything you can't trust Hlaudi MR Pistorious is very strong he stand by his own feet for the entire day so because people were claiming that Zuma is the who is the most corrupt in the ANC what will happen about the current president since he was implicated ?? @carnoth ngomane i mean his son is... ANC killed MAGAQA and that Mayor is walking free I bet Watson is the who fired Agrizzi... this man have a hatred with Watson so Bosasa was like ANC/Government they pay all ministers please ARREST Watson so Zuma has never worked with Bosasa ?? @Precious Ntshangase you mean Zuma has file of the ANC seniors ?? @Precious Ntshangase so Zuma and Ramaphosa are in a same whatsapp group ? bcs if not i think Ramaphosa should have done something about him
Madelein R,Morning I don't think they will be charged (the people that came to the commission). Zondo express his concern regarding Agrizzi's arrest yesterday. He said that it will discourage people to spill the beans @Marvel Ramatshela Agrizzi even drinks fancy water I wonder if they bought Chicci Watson's Springbok caps @Cerebis YES!! "@Cerebis I have just read. He was selected for Jnr Springbok @Ntombethemba Manase - Cyril received contributions from them for his election? The interesting question is - Did he ask for if? Or did they just give it? @Magda Seguin - thanks @carnoth ngomane - think so Bribery in parliament? Don't they have no respect? 😁 "@Magda Seguin - Yes he is "@funicanz - If he is seen with black people Talking about food again He remembers his fod food May be Watson is in Dubai sipping juice with the Guptas 🤣🤣 "@Magda Seguin - Yes
lehlogonololo lucky,morning
Felix Muyoba,@mphumudzeni siphuma the people he worked with were very stupid..i could have said my friend you sign for it yourself @Michael Michael i agree with you but thats the mistake we (as subordinates) do..just because someone is a boss @mphumudzeni siphuma true @Michael Michael agree "pre payment is stealing @Masewawatla Masewawatlasethe i guess so but of italian descent @African Refugee no man..thats too radical @Cerebis it should repossessed he thought they were gold..agrizzi is also a serious criminal..if it was gold then he could have kept them or what? @oupa makola no man..i wouldnt my goodness..19000 for a pair of shoes? @Yandi Masina i cant wait for that to happen..some of us are wallowing in poverty and some are buying shoes for 19K?
Malebo,No one is going to get arrested. You must remember that the president is also implicated in all this. Directly or indirectly Hlaudi is an attention seeker SABC - anc typical
Cassius Mngomezulu,Mornings Peeps
david jacobs,Off the topic Hlaudi Lyle Motsoeneng is really crazy he held manifesto speech under a tree That guy makes me laugh @Shark boi Smith The whole NEC got GW purses Hlaudi should grow an afro Cedric James Frolick as well? Cedric also had a GW purse ANC + Bosassa= corruption everywhere ANC scared of GAvin Watson his testimony will kill ANC point blank i want nothing to do with ANC Cyril is just so skelm .he never knows anything everyone got paid but him true @ Michael @makhosi nobhatyi cyril is also part and parcel to this corruption @Phillip Moshapo i dont believe Cyril Cyril must take andile to police station
carnoth ngomane,@Nthabiseng Malebo how is the president implicated "@mphumudzeni siphuma you will never know hey @Michael Michael that tell you that he is the architecture of state capture @Isihlahla Samabhinca how is the current president implicated @Isihlahla Samabhinca yes his son not him @makhosi nobhatyi people yearn for Ramaphosa to be implicated at all cost "@Derek Main not all of them @Madelein Huxtable i think theres more to come out of that story "@Derek Main is nkosazana dlamini zuma implicated "@Ntombethemba Manase and thats why lots of people hate him kid with new toys So Masuta turned them down @Ntombethemba Manase he refused to sell his soul @makhosi nobhatyi that can only happen if the ANC is really serious about cleaning up @makhosi nobhatyi he certainly needs backup @Pheladi Lamola i think Masutha could be helpful on that regard "@Mzalwane Mzala she's trying to settle the dust @Derek Main you are generalizing yes most mp's are corrupt not all of them and you cant prove that @Derek Main and the same mps forced him to resign remember? "@Derek Main everything has its own time period and remember the decision to oust him wasnt unanimous "@makhosi nobhatyi yes and somehow this bosasa debacle seem to be well orchestrated @Philani Madlala why? @makhosi nobhatyi so he knew it from the onset that he's gonna be the state witness @Derek Main what could be the cause of such behavior by the voters "@Derek Main you may be right but one could ask who vote for ANC @Derek Main are you are that there are plenty of people who do not have access to the kind of infor that u and i have and they vote regularly @Derek Main do you agree that the majority of voters dont have access to info @Derek Main do some research especially in the rural areas then you will see what im saying @Derek Main our grandparents and parents will always vote for ANC "@Derek Main ANC WILL WIN THE COMING ELECTION SIR "@Derek Main i guess theres no much you can do on that regard @Derek Main then lets vote for EFF and put Malema in power @Derek Main i hope you wont find it stupid for people to vote EFF in to power "@Derek Main the main riddle is @Derek Main thats why people will always vote for ANC "@Derek Main They are not Stupid rather loyal @Derek Main maybe it acts on their best interests not yours so you can call them stupid simply because they dont share your views @Derek Main yes there are corrupt individuals within the anc but the same ANC has done a lot for us which we were deprived of by the previous regime. "@Derek Main not maybe @Derek Main and we will vote them so they can sort out the mess vote ANC @Matthew Adams THEN WHO SHOULD WE VOTE FOR @Matthew Adams i like them but i will give ANC to redress @Naomi Ngwepe What better can DA DO/ "@Naomi Ngwepe please

Marvel Ramatshela,Mr Agrizzi always offered more water bottles than any witness. It's a pity he's going to jail still. No pardon for corruption CJ Zondo was surprised that one of dept of justice official was named there as corrupt "@Lloyd - you are right. But the problem is these folks will keep doing it hoping to be pardoned for being a whistle blower "ANC won't do anything about these comrades "I don't trust ANC "All corrupt individuals are on the MP list "I'm an EFF supporters "Supra is now an elephant in the room SA can't be a better country under the leadership of ANC
Anne M.,@Shark boi Smith Somebody at ACSA was also getting money @Eslon Eslon An innocent person would be beating down the commission door. @Magda Seguin Didn't Dennis Bloem ask for Vinny Petersen's death to be investigated. As far as I know Vincent Smith is still alive. "@Yandi Masina Me too @Yandi Masina I hope his death is being investigated @Talloolah Moon Should only be if he voluntarily comes to the Commission @SABC Digital News Why are we seeing the news?

Magda Seguin,Carrick Frolick was Parliament Chair *Cedric The corruption ran deep into parliamentary corridors What about what he stole himself?Zuma is the Chief Thief Andile should be subpeonaed The ANC anti CR faction is trying to frame him Andile should testify to clear his name if he was only in b Apparently he never requested money...it was offered by Watson to his son...could have been a setup.Remember it happened just before the ANC Nasrec conference..The ANC wanted NDZ to win CR is a billionaire...he didn't need the money for a campaign Agrizzi is very funny today... Dennis Bloem's testimony on the prisons exposed his colleagues big time He had a tumour on his heart His testimony is so colourful! He should really write a book All the details...yoh! Dennis Blown asked the Commission to investigate Vincent Smith's death.He thinks it was not an accident.Vincent Smith was totally against being bribed by Watson Please block this movie troll Thanks guys "Sorry my mistake @Anne M I think Judge Zondo took it seriously.....Mr Bloem was in tears when he asked for the investigation "Gillingham is out on bail I doubt Gillingham will get a deal...no reason as he is totally implicated...I will research what are his exact charges Nomvulas said she will protect Zuma with her buttocks...what is there to live about her? All the commission's videos are on Youtube Remember Agrizzi testified that the tenders specifications was drawn up by Gillingham and Smith...Watson and both of them should be arrested on that evidence alone Agrizzi has a LOT of material evidence Fact is @Innocent...it was taxpayers money and the ANC knew it Check on Google...lots of photos of Zuma with Watson..even Zumas birthday cake had Bosasa logos on "They also paid for the birthday parties All that apart from the bribes It's nonsense that Jonas started the Commission...this is a direct result of the Madonsela report calling for a commission of enquiry..The EFF lied saying they called for it Illegal transfer of money overseas...it amounts to billions out of SA...this is just an example How can the SABC go for YT monetization on a commission? Hhlaudi tendencies Strange @peter pott he is working with the commission investigators "@peter pott I worry about the evidence that is being destroyed The sound was compromised yesterday...worse today I blocked John a long time ago I think John should be repoted for hate speech Yes...its sqeaks like the start of a short circuit Leshabane is Watsonscright hand man and a Bosasa director "Why dont Zuma tell the country of his crimes Mr Ramathlodi's testimonyvwas extremely emotional...he exposed Zuma's charachter completely and hiw he operates with no respect for his office and the country He decided to come clean after he resigned and had the near death condition Agrizzi said when he was discharged from hospital he decided together with his family to expose Bosasa Vongani...the Guptas destroyed our SOE's dont forget so easily @Vongani...Adriaan Basson testified how he wrote since 2007 about the Guptas and nobody listened "Adriaan Basson exposed all the ANC politicians Lifestyle audits of all implicated needs to be done...some things cant be hidden...look at the Mpisanes in KZN Some EFF leaders wear R25k shoes I saw photos of that someone put on FB of EFF shoes..worn with a red overall @Yandi Masina...not slander hut fact EFF are hooligans The EFF spread hate and destruction Watson visited Zuma twice at Nkandla..Agrizzi explained it in detail in his previous testimony @Cerebis...yes "Thuli dont get upset Cubana I suppose the best single malt would flow at the SONA after party "Jazz concerts And to think SARS hounds one for a few rand!!! From April SARS will no longer give medical aid rebates...they are bleeding us dry and on top VAT and fuel kevyvwas increased.Im livid at this wholesale theft of our hard earned sweat and blood Agrizzi resigned and Watsin tried to bribe him with R50m to go back @Nkosi.....the 2017 and 2018 Budget speeches...check online Moodys statement ciming later today Everyone who takes their work seriously have very detailed diaries...I saved all mine over the years...I regard it as legal documents I can relate to Agrizzi...I write ecerything down @Yin Yang I do it systematically If Watson is arrested he will probably pay bail with taxpayers money Zuma and Bosasa/Gupta are thecsame whatsapp group @Vongani...exactly!

Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi As long as he's not expecting forgiveness. All these criminals must serve time. Ramaphosa gave us the spin on the R500K - the real truth will come out soon. @carnoth ngomane All ANC MPs are implicated - they protected Zuma for years. @carnoth ngomane Tell me which ones didn't protect Zuma. @makhosi nobhatyi Ramaphosa should be marching his son to the police station right now if he were true to his word. @makhosi nobhatyi It is very clear that the entire ANC knew that Bosasa was corrupt because they were all getting paid bribes. @Afika Centane You can get fooled by the spin but most thinking SAfns know the truth. It's become all to clear with these commissions. All ANC MPs (incl Ramaphosa) are corrupt to the core. @makhosi nobhatyi His father probably suggested it - he knew Bosasa was the ANC's cash cow. @carnoth ngomane I can prove it - check which MPs voted to protect Zuma - ALL the ANC MPs did - they are all corrupt. @carnoth ngomane Yes - they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to come to that decision. They could see the anger of all SAfns and had to act eventually. @Vongani Maluleke Yes - we need to be liberated from the liberators. "@Vongani Maluleke Agree - political parties must know that if they mess up @Thando Nkutha No they don't - they treat voting like supporting a soccer team. @carnoth ngomane Ignorance @carnoth ngomane Yes you could ask that. I don't mind if people vote for any political party after giving it some thought. But to blindly vote for a party no matter what they do is just stupid. @Vongani Maluleke Exactly - that's how it should be. "@carnoth ngomane And many that do have access to this info still vote for a corrupt "@carnoth ngomane No I don't agree Maybe not as much info but there are newspapers all over @carnoth ngomane I think the ANC likes it that way - they want their voters to be kept in the dark so they can continue their plunder. "@carnoth ngomane If hey know of all the corruption @carnoth ngomane Yes - all I'm saying is that it is idiotic behaviour. We should be holding our government to account. ANC voters are allowing our government to go rogue and steal. Thanks for that all you ANC voters. @Michael Michael I know you are - I think it's stupid. @carnoth ngomane Any other party would be better than the ANC. They are just looters. @Michael Michael You are sitting here listening to all the corruption of the ANC and yet you're going to vote for them! How is that not stupid? @carnoth ngomane OK @carnoth ngomane No I don't - they have not been in power so I don't know how they will behave. I do know exactly how the ANC behaves - pure corruption. @carnoth ngomane It's obvious to everyone else. @carnoth ngomane So you're admitting they are being stupid if the man is actually killing them. @carnoth ngomane Being loyal to a political party is stupid. Especially if that party is not acting in your best interests. It's not rocket science. @carnoth ngomane Please tell me how ANC self-enrichment is in anybody's interest but their own. @carnoth ngomane Maybe so but they should have to much much more. The problem is they stole all the money. "@carnoth ngomane The ANC has corrupted all levels of government. From the civil service @carnoth ngomane Like I've said before voting for the ANC to sort out corruption is like americans voting for the Ku Klux Klan to sort out racial prejudice. @funicanz At least other parties would be moving in the right direction - not making corruption worse like the ANC

Pheladi Lamola,Masutha is soft-spoken for nothing. He is a crook like the rest of them. Masutha turned them down and then what? Did he report these guys? Anyone? I don't know @Robert Russel. Gwede? Law enforcement? These people wanted to corrupt him. Mcebisi told his minister at the time. He didn't turn them down and left it at that. So who did Masutha tell? If that's the case Ntombethemba that'd be great. He must just come to the commission then and furnish us with his version.

Malux Xihahele,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace Agrizzi now qualifies for military witness protection plan "Aaaaaaace "Agree with Philani "Politicians across the world only one common goal during the leberation struggle. Once liberation has been achieved So what we need is a strong opposition to become our watch man. A strong opposite will always assist any country in the world to achieve great because those who are in opposition are hungry so they will always expose those who are stealing to public "Therefore my approach to politics is to vote for the oppositiion all the time. When the opposition wins the power and become the government of the day My advise is that we should not get married to political parties. we should list our expectations to any we vote for and if they do not deliver we change our vote to someone else. "@ Ryan John I should say we are fortunate as a nation to have people like Agrizzi coming forward to expose the well organized crime which has potential of sinking the country. "Now that Agrizzi has done his job "@Pott It most cases elephats fight and grasss suffers but this time around elephats are fighting and grass rejoices "Agrizzi should have done law Agrizzi proved Guptas to be interns in capturing the state. This is the real state capture. So as things appear ANC is sponsoring itself through corruption "@Magda "The credit for state capture inquiry goes the Thuli Madosela The state capture inquiry is ANC on corruption trial. All appearing are ANC members and i do not think they really needed this inquiry to take off but the courts forced them "Therefore no ANC member should get any credit for the establishment of the state capture inquiry
