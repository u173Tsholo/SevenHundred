Anne M.,@SABC Digital News Please may we have some visuals? Thank you @SABC Digital News There's an echo on the sound - it appears we are not getting sound from the microphone "Yes Still on lunch? @Koena Mahlaba I'm being sarcastic 😉 @SABC Digital News Please sort out the sound @Lucky Bebeza Proof? I can't wait It will be quite a show
bongile sango,sound is not nice it's like they are in a cave now Hlaudi is going to account here no two ways for him Hlaudi is going to account here no two ways for him Hlaudi is going to account here no two ways for him they fixed the sound now
Franco Ngulube,The sound from the mic is not clear
Lucky Bebeza,"what do you expect zondo is a crook
Mzwandile Magoso,I can hardly hear the sound too this is so unprofessional 😕 thanks something is fishing🤔.... see 🚮 ANC government is nonsense. it's time for change
Tumelo Koboekae,How long should we expect Hlaudi to be criminally charged for selling SABC archived shows I wonder wt Muti Hlaudi uses hai it seems he had more power than board of SABC members from COO to Stakeholder relations executive and still have guts to sell SABC archived enterainment to multichoice the archive deal he sold it singlehandedly and pocketed over R30m on the side 4 himself and never had power to do it ethically now dstv is reaping rewards of SABC encore from Hlaudi's greed
Koena Mahlaba,"work on the sound please lol 😃 are you for real very unprofessional much better
kaizer mosia,zondo is a real leader he knows his story very well.... thanks sound ok now......
Sthakathi Khumalo,SABC Digital News can you sort out sound. Its sounds offish. Thanks SABC Digital News Thank you!! "Succession planning really "Look guys "Its simple Matric was a requirement but Hlaudi was appointed based on what he could deliver!! "The follow up should be Peter pott LOOLS... ITS SO SIMPLE BUT THEY RUNNING IN CIRCLES Nico Buisenhout was appointed interim CEO at SAA also "DCJ Augustine Monau YES!
siyabonga mlamuli,thank you very much
Tusef Bilal,Dr Ngubane compromise himself way Mara mxm colleagues am having a problem with Dr Ngubane he is Dr of administration he knows all criteria on how to employ nd he know HR hw could he appointed hlaudi mxm colleagues am saying Dr Ngubane is a board member of sabc way he did condone to appointed a person without qualifications gee peex1 am saying de was corruption by appointing hlaudi without matric nd tertiary qualification. is nonsense. but if you condone it is ur choice wether u can do the job we still need qualifications nd a person who went to school especially university they can think big than drop out.
GOOD AFRICA TV,those are the people who are really deserve to be planished not innocent people(foreign national).... especially Hlaudi deserves ukubulawa straight uyibulele I sabc
Keith Hodgson,Same venue for months....and they can't get the sound right immediately they start!
Antonie Engelbrecht,no pride in product i smell a zupta
Sindiswa Moolman,His testimony... not mine Oohhh... @Thando Nkutha. We talk about cutting your nose to spite your face. Depart of education should have the records @Thando Nkutha How old is Hlaudi? Thanks @Zama Nzuza Ben is a looting enabler I can see that @Miranda Valashiya. Was tempted to say it in my language
Kevin Simon,Clutching at straws. Judge exhales. Exasperated. Bullshit witness. Screwed up Eskom together with snotty teary Brian. Got hi DCJ. They let us down BADLY. BUT WHY PAY the water-bearer so much?????????????????????????????? This Is Balls ​Water bearer was an activist against Apartheid.. He was too young to remember apartheid. I lived under the system for almost 40 years! I fought it too. """Suppressed by the Chairperson"" LOCK HIM UP!!!!!!!" Ben also embroiled in a matter of fake share certificates... Speaks volumes. Clear as mud. and he does so with surprise on his face. Ben and his cohort just did Zuma's bidding. So what about the fact that he had committed a fraudulent claim that he had matric!!!!!!!!!!!?? Bizarre level of diligence by the Board. Ben is a stuck record. Here we go again. Crisis is the basis at every case of corruption. Consistent picture in this commission. But there were some well qualified staff who were simply displaced by those wanting to grab the broadcaster. "peter pott same time Which Minister?
Jack Sparrow,clever judge so we didn't advertise...?
Matthew Moyo,that position should have been advertised l think the prior experience method that they used to appoint Mr Tlaud was not fare lf one of the conditions of feeling a position in an advertisement is matric those who don't have it must not be considered
Macedo Segunda,this is useless
Lourens De Jager,exactly how our government works.... you sit in a chair and someone else needs to help you find the correct file. and help you put numbers into words. "i think the files should be in different colors. then they can say purple can't find the right file and page. but you have a demanding job . isn't matric the first education you have to have ? "letting competent people go  appoint the people and friends that would turn a blind eye on corruption.
peter pott,"parly investigated this "@gee "@khumalo "this question is difficult. because you cannot be "so they applied RPL "hlaudi played politics "I am waiting for  "@gee "I am not sure what the commission is now trying to proof really. because as we chasing around this matters "@thando "@no1 blame naspers for paying him that comm. Why did they ever do that first stop india??????😀😀😀 "😀😀I love this comrades "@gee "hlaudi was raw☺☺☺ people wants to ""eat""😀😀😀." they will get answers from the board on hlaudi. Claudia was simply appointed from luthuli/union building. he did a great job for the master. When was he ever rebuked by either of this houses? "Dcj "you see chair "make no mistake

Hiltonw111,Seeing the docs for the first time??? No one is going to jail. half are on suspension with full pay. Years later still collecting. "@Roger Harris I lived overseas for 20 years came back and still see SA as a country that could be best in the world Affirmative action and BEE has failed The SABC archives need to be returned. Hlaudi needs to pay back his comms on the archive deal The majority are sheep @Gee Peex1 what did he sell? The Guptas are long gone. Forget that money or jail time To be blunt they are not socially evolved
Native Texan,First time here.
Shrikant proff,hiii
Mangalani Mangalani,Is this guy a doctor?
Roger Harris,He really contradicts himself and has a straight face. I watched him on the Escom enquiry same old ame old. Orange uniforms are waiting for measurements. hopefully soon. Hilton111w111 I agree all implicated should go to jail. Just think how we could have developed the country without these gangsters.
Johnny James,Kaizer Kganyago should testify... This SABC
