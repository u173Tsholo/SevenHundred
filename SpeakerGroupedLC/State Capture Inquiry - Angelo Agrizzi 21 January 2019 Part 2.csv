Portia Dludlu -Siska,African time...
Siya_Map,eNCA is on
Andre Gerber,Agrizzi does not look well and he has not been granted the 204 Indemnity it is the 2010 investigation that dragged till now against Bosasa he's got 4 bodyguards and has been threaten. If anything happens to him now it would be a stupid move
CICA - Crime Intelligence & Community Awareness,@Lucky Molepo why do you want to know? Is there a price on his head for info on where he is? @Thando Nkutha - explain? Boys & Girls - can we all have a moment's silence please for all your hard earned taxes which paid for this fatties caviar 🤣🤣🤣 "A moments silence please for all the PAYE taxes which were deducted from your payslips which subsequently funded the fancy cars @Thando have you visited our Facebook page? Or Twitter? Why are BOSASA directors not in prison yet? The others can sit in jail so long while we wait Lucky Thando - we are posting you a troll badge All politicians are corrupt We need a new balanced sensible party which is not corrupt "Every time you see VAT being paid on your till slips think of all the fancy suits Kevin. yes Kevin - Agrizzi also spoke earlier before lunch about the Aston Martin parked at Nomvula Mokonyane house "Who remembers cash heists of USD from airplanes at OR Tambo International? If you do watch Fridays evidence why did BOSASA want remotes for the cargo gates at ORTIA? They didnt do security at cargo area. Does anyone else wonder about the massive amounts of cash that went missing at ORTIA? Kevin where do you work? For who? 😂🤣😂 Imvula these people joking about rare beef... while people starve ... while these fat cats eat well from our taxes. "Nomvula Mokonyane was apparently getting 120 crates of cool drink "Blake's Travel keeps being mentioned as the travel agency who booked all the hotels Blake's Travel located at 70 Main Reef Road 1759 Randfontein - Aureus Gauteng - South Africa 011 693 3761 saw all these government officials flights and cars being booked and never smelt a rat? BOSASA head office very close to Randfontein. It appears Agrizzi ate the whole chicken farm What about the DA counselor being married to owner of Blake's travel? Coincidence? Yes Kevin and the neighbors WHY ARE BOSASA DIRECTORS NOT IN jail yes... thank you @Kabelo M our comments were limited <<<<<------ we exposed Bell Pottinger Agrizzi talking about diets is an oxymoron
Egbert Mkoko,@lucky Molepo I hope he will go direct to his home place😅

EFF is the way... it is only those who smoked nyaope whi still want the whole nation to be believe that EFF is involved in vbs ✊✊✊✊ ANC will regret for not listening to their father of corruption JZ what you smoking is very dangerous for your fact is ANC is corrupt to the core... "I remember what Fylod Shivambu said to #ThumaMina that @Tobela I take it that you did not see him at the state capture inquiry when PG went there... is it wrong for cic to attend parties? "he fought for this inquiry for nothing? nkebe re sa hwe
Tobela Ntshibongo,BLF is the way "Malema sold out EFF Mazzotti owns EFF "Julius is captured by WMC. he is so silent about nationalization of banks Julius and Floyd have avoided Debates with Mngxitama because they known BLF will expose them "Mngxitama is very critical on logik "Ever since PreZuma resigned "Oh really Julius attends parties Julius only went to the State capture enquiry because there was a VBS Saga which implicated him. He wanted to fight back and defend himself not that he cares about the enquiry
TheRealQiniso .K,id rather die then vote BLF! iyohh most idiotic party ever EFF will definately beat DA in the upcoming elections that's 4 sure! EFF can't debate with Fools like BLF ! BLF speaks non-sensical things .how can you debate with a crazy man Ndlozi is a philosopher a Dr. ! Mgxitama is just a mad man ...high on sumthing very strong if you think Mngxitama is logik ! than you must be crazy yourself! the blind leading the blind

Mzamo Mkhwanazi,Eish uthini uBabes wamaFiles namhlanje....I missed out!
clayton chukwu,The best thing for South Africa is to become a full communist socialist state so it can fail . South Africa needs capitalism and free markets .ANC is abusing its power and the EFF is just an unstable child and the DA has no chance of winning elections until the join forces with COPE IFP @Tseleng Phala I understand but it’s really disgusting how the government operates without any conscious behavior The best thing is for everyone not to vote simple and if not allow communism to take over South Africa so the South Africans can learn the same lesson like Cuba and Venezuela Just vote me I’ll be the best president Cope is that even a political party
Khalid Mather,"oh ok  "EFF do too  no one worth voting for besides Dagga party In an environmentally friendly way? EFF never talks environment and mining affected communities meat is corrupt

Luka Sibanda,Zuma and his previous cabinet must be tried in a court of law
Eugene Dormehl,Yip. It started with the ANC regime after NM "No Leeroy Someone got paid in the PP office.
Leeroy Lepere,As a black person ive lost all hope I hope you white people are happy and proud
Bongumenzi Nxumalo,I wonder how Bosasa was missed in Madonselas report hmm Tseleng Phala lols
Bheki Mdletshe,Agrizzi is here to save his own skin and throwing everyone under the bus. He is looking for leniency when the corruption charges are pursued because they are coming for him.
Morolo Jay Maponya,Bongumenzi this Agrizzi guy said that the way they cooked the whole saga was in such a manner that even auditors i presume he meant forensics missed it so u can imagine Where was this beef going to? Prison or ? no wonder Nomvula looks so fresh and fit...well fed
Mzwanele shange,🤨 these people.....
Orapeleng Tawana,just waiting to hear my name
Jubakhuzwayo Khuzwayo,Guys I missed the start of the 2nd part (after lunch) who received groceries from who? Really?? Shocking!!!!!
