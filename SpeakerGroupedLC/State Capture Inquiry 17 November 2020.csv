See Earth,You make a mockery of the REAL issues He claims there are lizard people running the world and that he is jesus? You think that is a credible source? "By all means david ick is a fraudster who is simply making money out of those gullible enough to believe his rubbish "I agree that NWO is indeed a conspiracy theory "@Kieron Sinewave you would be an imbecile to think otherwise. I have lost friends and family LOL! This diversion tactic will backfire @Teunis van Ree it's what he doesn't say that will be most revealing "They still have to ask him the questions @Maritime Studies this sets up a precedent for the courts - it allows all sides to be heard before teh courts take over. Let's hope that the law wins @Thapelo Juluka I think that the honourable Mr Zondo has no fear. "@M Place you are totally correct. But all criminal organisations have a head "@Maritime Studies sorry "@Banele Masuku LOL
Kelly Jurgens,@see earth how do you his a fraud? @see earth freedom of speech I tell you. @ see earth so you disagree that the NWO does not run the world? @see earth so do you believe that the 'Pandemic' exist? I won't be surprised if they do not cross question Zuma today. @cooler cat that's why I sometimes feel Law and order was created for poor and not the rich. @Francois they have every right to arrest him if he pulls off that stunt. @Jonny Zondo does not need to recuse himself.
bongile sango,Gm my lovely people how are you Does this means Zuma is not going to testify at all now. Because he's playing delaying tactics @Heather I think this week was scheduled for him.I also wish they've maid an arrangements for other witness. I so wish the billion has been spent here can't be like waste. we want to see the results Here we go now Zondo is praying for strength for this session Zondo is here to stay till the end Noba usafutha uZondo Maybe we must expect somebody else in that chair today. Zondo decided to give up Eish not convinced
Maritime Studies,"What are we doing about our riches. We are rich for Europe? That’s why I say Government must be 50%% black50% white. White can assist to control Europe and America. Us Free earth - really? Let’s agree to agree on that. You have your views which I won’t say you lost credibility about. "Yhoo "Heather Mr Place- Spot on "I am not agains the. COmmission "Bongile "See earth "Heather "See earth I know this Maxine you are quoting
Kieron Sinewave,sup i dont think any1 here qualified enough to talk this amount of trash @Heather Durr ye i got it 😕 "imagine if everyone did their job and only spoke about what they know 😆 😆 speculation is awesome """if not you @SABC News whats going on? @SABC News ? no-one is speaking 😆 hence no sound ⁉⁉⁉⁉⁉⁉⁉ oh wow ........................... ......................... UM
Heather Durr,@See Earth @Kelly Jurgens The reptilians and the NWO.I went thru that phase "Hi @Kieron Sinewave We are discussing the future of the world and conspiracy theories which are @bongile sango Hi Zuma's applications will all be rejected as per the blatant blackmail by his counsel [altho it is the obvious path]. I hope they have other witnesses tor this week @Maritime Studies @Teunis van Ree There is no reason not to interrogate Zuma pending the applications. I doubt his counsel will allow it. Another session of 'non incrimination' will be fun but Pretorius is not as aggressive and quick as Kate and Myburg If they had any sense they would have realised that Zuma would not testify under any circumstances. They should have witnesses lined up "@ALTA Hi there. We are determining the future of civilisation Zuma's entourage really enjoy flashing their cash in a tasteless manner. the woman is one of his 5 children Zondo wants to see them in chambers Camera man-I really dont need to see Zuma constantly as in 'EVERY *ING SECOND "@Rene Ngwenya I was really annoyed-we know what rights Zuma has It would still my heart to see Hofmeyer or Myburgh or Seleka DCJ has an obligation to the watching public-I hope he realises that @FieliesSA Hi there DCJ will not recuse himself-he may say he needs more time-but this decision is easy. The law is entirely on his side The legal team is not there There is no sound-they tested it then turned it off Oh how predictable NO DCJ IS RIGHT. DCJ cant give a decision too quickly as otherwise they will use that against him in the review proceedings
M Place,"David Icke is educated man @Maritime...true..all the SIU reports were sitting with the Hawks before the commission was even thought of...prosecute...rather than waist money. Zuma is not the only one guilty...all those ministers and unions who got him to be President knowing he had 700 charges of corruption before he even campaigned in the ANC is guilty... Zondo is not a friend of Zuma...there is no need to step down..
Teunis van Ree,Zuma won't say anything useful @Heather Durr I agree they should have some spare witnesses lined up Same as with Dudu. Adv Pretorius's propositions will stand @FieliesSA correct GM @ALTA 🌷 And the trolls are starting already... hey @JS Bach hey @Pastor J.J hi @MARK DURBAN lawyers with DCJ in chambers GM @Valencia J🌷 @Valencia J great now that you are here 😊 hallo @zip reeper Some more Sikh philosophy coming up Bye... time to get some real work done.
FieliesSA,@Teunis van Ree They dont have to say anything usefull. Its about the questions that the commision is putting to whim with proof Morning @ALTA Whats happening now? Why the delay? The only valid explanation is Zondo is preparing to floor these guys Morning @Pastor J.J @Heather Durr Morning again @ALTA "@Valencia J There is no whites involved NO NO NO NO NO!!!! He must he here WHo's ? His neighbour? THis more important If he is not here tomorrow then he ansers TODAY!!! wait what? That means 2 to 3 days wasted> Very happy for someone going to funeral

You can't sink a commissions entire function for the sake of 1 witness out of hundreds..

EFF may give you a chance to loot if they ever get into power. I wish you luck. @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee I don't belong to a party. I have enough self-repect to represent only myself. @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee I see you only value yourself as a voter. There's a lot more to me than my vote. I feel a little sad for you that you only value yourself as a vote. @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee I'm not new here at all. But is the first time I wasted my time on talking to you.

What ever happened to punctuality? @Bradley Gother commenting here is important because it allows us from across ZA to engage each other I’m sorry SABC you need to check your equipment 1 hour before start not 5 mins.
