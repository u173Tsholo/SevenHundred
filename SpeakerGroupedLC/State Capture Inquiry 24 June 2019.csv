Mulunghisi Mulunghisi,whose is coming today what do you mean 94 "luvuko "country lead by political party not by just a human being or a company mzalwana you write im surprice tooo
Solomon Ndubane,"life will humble you
Born free,The outcome of voting the ANC in for a 6th term is a disaster for this country. 57% lack of wisdom Not arrogance but Wisdom. How much proof do you need that the ANC are corrupt state looters You have yourselves to blame Yes and Lynne Brown and the HOD I did not vote for them and I sleep peacefully in this regard It's like having 30 Years of Robert Mugabe a disaster a pity Most are not educated or qualified. They are professionals in looting taxpayers money Yes this chat site has been hacked by the Chinese 😈 A smart business owner would not involve themselves in unethical practices and corruption Everyone knows you keep records for 5 years It sounds as though she owned a cash in transit business The previous witness has implicated her and the Investigator She is not wise She had a job II would be suspicious if someone came to me with such a prospect "That's money laundering She stole existing clients The ANCs involvement in crime is mind blowing. Ramaphosa and his ANC campaign in under investigation by the PP. Investigating where their funds come from. YOLO you can focus on on the witness and not look at the live chat. it's simple Too young and gullible YOLO yours is not YOLO you can't tell people what they must comment on. cut off his head 🤣 YOLO what do you you not understand. You can block me YOLO has alot of educational advice 😂😂 So it would appear that the ANC has hijacked all State owned Entities to fund their campaigns pay bribes and enrich themselves. I doubt if any foreign governments other than the Chinese would fund it. Oh Lord now we gave a prostitute selling sex on this chat site 😲 I think they withdrew the cash from the banks that's why they had unmarked v She is an enabler that was the purpose of opening her business Most people involved in corruption and defrauding others use charm to be convincing. She received money lots of money ANC is the house of pain Their is no innocence here they are all enablers Yes Norman that is true Zuma nullified the Scorpions and brought in the corrupt Hawks not all but Jiba and many others. Sounds Greek This pertains to the Aviation Industry This is the enquiry into the Aviation contract and the missing millions. SAX and Korineka ..as per the previous witness The heist led to the investigation by the hawks Yes this all about the millions of cash that was paid to those implicated by the previous witness.
Thami Ngwenya,who was supposed to win the vote "Guys we are tired ""born free" Can we stop insulting people its Monday because Verwoerd will never come back again Uyabuza manje "Still waiting which Engel party Agree with you Magda bring back the money "At least she cant plead ignorant But banks control minimum cash disbursement per client per day Everyone bring back money stolen "Mashaba 0.3% George She broke now Banks asked where funds always "Uyabuza lomama "uYAKHALA MANJE
Sizwe Owen,power to that Born Free she's too light to be asked Fox please make sure she kept hydrated she'll need much more of those water bottles
carnoth ngomane,"@Born free just wait for another five years and gather more voters to outvote them @Born free you should blame yourself for failing to outvote them @Thando Nkutha waiting foe that as well @Derek thats the least you can do @Thando Nkutha the liquidators @Derek while doing that dont forget to recruit more voters otherwise you will wait for more years @Derek just put up with that s****t for five year and come up with a strtegy to oust them This woman is full of lies "@Mzalwane she must have known what she was doing "and she never kept records "This woman knew what she was doing she was in the crossroads of money laundering @Thando Nkutha its because the focus is on the inquiry not politics @Cerebis she definitely knows shes just playing hide and seek now we getting to the bone of the matter she is playing dumb now
Mzalwane Mzala,Arrogant people never accept defeat A question was asked about who was supposed to win @Thando Nkutha 😁😁😁 Miss Viljoen Words are important in legal matters Eish This advocate is kwaai This witness reminds me of Manyi who started with confidence and ended up with a wimp The smile has dissapeared @sanele songelwa I am also waiting @Thami Ngwenya Andries is like Brian van Wyk Derek only comes for political propaganda and nothing else. Just observe his behaviour. In the UK parents were recently convicted for giving money to their child who was part of Isis Yhoo I think like Babadi she allowed herself to be used. hahaha "Afetr Babadi DCJ must allow her to move on and come back to it There is clarity! They had 4 drivers and nthing about security guards Mntungwa! The more beautiful they are ....@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Subpoenaed It has to be like that Her kind of business was susceptible to being used for money laundering and she seems unable to wrap her head around this fact. Were you going to tell us if she tithed there @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ ?
Owen Nyilika,I Want To See Mr Brian VAN WKY All THEM NOT REMEMBER ANY THING BUT WHEN THEY STEAL THEY REMEMBER "MALEMA All TSOTSIS MUST GP TO PRISON THIS WOMAN IS LYING GUYS

Carvin Motsumi,I m happy that whatever is happening & happened b4 not happened with my vote.
Christian Boonzaaier,we should all hang our heads in shame over the ANC being back in power...we really have a lot of stupid people here in south africa
funicanz,Morning @Thando Nkutha 😆😆 What is Ms Viljoen testifying about? Who is she? This witness is so playful. How many pages is her affidavit?
Siyanda Ntloko,😂😂😂😂 "the sound engineer is still on weekend
Cassius Mngomezulu,This question was not answered---A question was asked about who was supposed to win
Bongani Ntuli,guys why this witness was not asked about her education background please balance me? thanks @FElix Muyoba for explanaition 😁😁😁😁 ref was not important to me wat a joke 😀😀😀😀😀😀 hang on miss viljoen lol
Felix Muyoba,@Bongani Ntuli not necessary because she has her own business and not working for a state entity i guess.. she is lying..everything!!! she is nervous.. this lady was involved in money laundering or her business was used as a money laundering entity.. that is why her business was apparently a money remitter (whatever that is).. she is on the brink of crying and she will certainly cry if queezed a lot.. this lady was used i can sense it.. she was trying to make a living.. @Born free yeah but someone swindled her to leave that job and establish another one.. half a billion? some crooks could just tell her that we want to move this money to that client and we will give this cut then she agrees..thats what her business was doing.. @Thapelo Motabogi imagine if it was you (a comrade) doing that..all sorts of names you will be labeled she is also a criminal..how can she just accept money without asking where the money is coming from.. the business model was wrong @Thapelo Motabogi 😂😂😂😂😂😂 @Thando Nkutha true..its rubbish she is thief! am sure she has invested lots of the profit into properties or offshore account and the business is liquidated.. she should pay back the money it was a useless business model..even school leaver could do such a business.. @Tholithemba Ntsele people deposit money into her account and instruct her to withdraw it in cash and deliver that money to them..such a nonsense business model!! @Tholithemba Ntsele thats what the commission is trying to tell her and she is very ignorant..she didnt know that she was involved in money laundering @Phillip Cwazibe but you should know where the money comes from..what if it stolen money you are told go cash up? lie lie "@Neo Thebe 😂😂😂 you cant wait it is difficult to trace these monies because it was just money laundering thats why its not clear cut.. as for me I have already sentenced her to jail this lady is small afrikaaner brat.. @Cerebis apologies @Robert Russell apologies but am sure she knew that some transactions were questionable but turned a blind eye just to make money..
clive oconnell,Sound engineer panicking that SABC pay wages this month Abel wait for the other boot to fall 🙈🙉🙊 FICA compliant ?? Did they have a regular parking bay at ANC HQ ?? Yolo This is why we employ accountants and lawyers Thando Don’t admit your stealing Pastor l think most churches demand more than 0.03% 🙏🏼 Pastor And like these thieves don’t pay taxes Robert Don’t spoil the story by looking at back page. @Diana Money 💰 has many colours
Singi Mathebula,full here again? sickening 👹
Derek Main,@Luvuyo Zantsi My heart is sore because we have a bunch of thieves running our country for their own benefit. Only the ANC fools couldn't see it. @carnoth ngomane I have no choice but to wait for the next elections but I'll rub every ANC voters face in it whenever the ANC stuffs up. They always do. @carnoth ngomane And I intend to do it. So no ANC voter must cry and say wait for 5 years when I do it. I have every right to call out these criminals. @carnoth ngomane Everything the ANC touches turns to s**t. @carnoth ngomane My strategy would be that all the criminals be charged and sent to jail. That should get rid of most of the ANC officials. Corrupt to the core. @Yolo More This is all about the ANC's criminality - how's that not politics? "@Born free Yeah - so much for the ""New Dawn"" - what a farce. It's just the same as before - same criminals in charge." Or just block me if you don't want to see what I type. @Yolo More Your non-response speaks volumes. "Yolo - not to my question you didn't. Viz. ""Do you not see the connection between the ANC being in power and all this corruption being exposed here?""" @Sofia Sofia I think we need to get more radical. We must follow the Chinese example - death to corrupt officals. @Tholithemba Ntsele Yes - the ANC has made SA a criminal's paradise. @Tholithemba Ntsele Damned straight!
Yolo More,She is young beautiful and not that smart. As I suspected that she is not that smart. Lisela eli. Why did she go for this business in the first place? Hahaha Mzala a female version of Manyi😋😋 "Russel and Derek Huh! Derek that we all know and no one denies it. Will you then let us focus on the witness for now. Born Free there are comments in the live chat that are educating. Born Free that is how I want to see those that are. "Derek Main "Born Free I said 'will you please' "Derek "Derek I do Derek. """I am stuck""😋😋" People were enriching themselves all along. "Felix This is interesting. Exactly Clive now I see. This country needs a total cleaning. Corruption was/is on another level mos. "Yes Magda "Fuzile Is it his real name or the ID is fake? George Makidis Born Free if it's even his real name. Yhooooo! She does not need an evidence leader. She must be cross examined. "Thando Nkutha I OPENED MY WATER😂😂😂 Sofia😂😂😂🤗🤗🤗 Tsotsi this one He won't understand it Thando Nkutha Avis she is more of a crook than dumb. "I see it ""chairs"" 😂😂😂😂"

Morning Magda..... 500 MILLION per month Agrizzy used to go to the garage to collect cash.... he should have used this chick.... much easier ..... Here is the link She delivered 5M to Lyn Brown...... watch this space Here we go with derogatory speech again.... unacceptable @Felix Muyoba @Diana Sekatane .....exactly.... some are just more aware about being used @Magda Seguin ...yes I read that as well.... what a disgrace..... the ANC will as a collective look after each other until proven guilty.

Magda Seguin,"This women had free everything financing It's her CC but she didn't have a job title..how odd The Guptas opened up a host of shelf companies in Dubai too same as in SA for money laundering Yellow bone is a derogatory term "No business acumen She is trying to charm the DCJ She copied the business model of the cash in transit company she worked for before She said herself that she copied the business model of her former employer "I was thinking of funds coming from CIT but it needs to be proven Yoh! 100 calls a day! Reinette go on Twitter and follow the story from the beginning on the state capture account and timeline "Moneygram is an internationally controlled entity with serious checks and balances "South African banks was supposed to red flag the millions upon millions that went through but they didn't There are strict laws that govern money to be sent nationally and internationally The banks were involved listen to the witness and the DCJ The monies are collected from the bank with a SECURE CASH VECHICLE Keith I went through a process including having a tax clearance certificate "There was a time when unmarked vehicles were said to be the answer against heists @Ben Cole the connection will probably still come It sounds suspicious that someone working with so much money does not know that FICA is a legal requirement as an FSB In all dealings involving legalities documents must be kept for 5 years in some instances 10 years as in obstetrics and gynaecology Keith 😂 She does that all the time Reinette Agree @Reinette Appearances can be deceitful "She hot a cut from the transactions Koreneka? Isn't that the company of the previous witness? Thanks @Anne M She told DCJ earlier that the references was her own tracking system "Ok I see that Lynn Brown wants to come to the commission to clear her name It's a newspaper report this morning who quotes her One actually has to ask where the funds are derived from not just whether it is their funds "This is exactly what the Guptas and Zuma wanted with their strategy I read that the commission is paying for Zuma to testify
