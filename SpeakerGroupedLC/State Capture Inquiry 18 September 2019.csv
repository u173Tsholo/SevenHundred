zintle ndzwangu,Morning Youtubers Are we gettingsomewhere with this evidence? Busy morning
Mashao Mohale,Hi
Morolo Jay Maponya,morning sesi Zintle
Tinashe Mangena,I'm in
Zamankwali Ngema,Morning... üòÄüòÄbut given the opportunity... @ Clive oconnell.. Can pls someone call Hlaudism to come n glamorotize the sound here...
Sindiswa Moolman,Eish... we bought him so many vehicles to the tune of R3m Let‚Äôs wait and see @Lawrence Matshoane. 2020 is the year of Prosecutions. I agree @Born free. That‚Äôs why we shouldn‚Äôt despair. "Agreed @Pastor J. As @Born free said I see @Pastor J know what he‚Äôs talking about about pastors Zuma once told us that he didn‚Äôt fight for freedom to be poor @clive oconnell. So I tend to agree with that statement. A lot @Celuthando Celuthando. Don‚Äôt know where to start to fill you in. Just watch and listen you will get more. "All I can tell you now Not back yet? Money laundering scheme Colonel Naidoo must come here and confirm all this hearsay How many trips are we talking about here? Thanks @Nyasimi Geoffrey By this time next year all former state capturers will be in and out the courts answering on their crimes Guys @Stays Stevens is fooling all of you The structural framework of State Capture was established between 2010 and 2011 and the looting commenced in 2013 to 2017. Anyone who was appointed in 2010 onwards has something to say in this comm My point @I am Free. The operations of the State Capture project were in full swing during this period. So sad that we had to lose so much money Agreed @I am Free. Exactly @Roza essack Thats why i believe this R355million we have spent on this Commission is worth it if it will give us at least half of that money back @I Am Free Is he chewing gum? "Hayi guys I agree @Roza essack He was intimidated and there are death threats on him @Paul Buchel Hope they will investigate @I Am Free He is really brave @Paul Buchel. Hope he has protection. "The thing is; he came here with clean hands That absurd @Person of interest what is this equation all about @Blessing Machengo ? Awaiting sentencing @makhosi nobhatyi Renjeni Munsamy is placed on special leave after this witness's testimony They were friends when all this happened in 2008. Big supporters of Jacob Zuma in the ANC Youth League @Tshwane Yamo≈°ate Mdluli is using his crime intelligence skills now...remotely. JZ @Mulder Steyn Bye guys...
JS Bach,Morning peeps! All these expensive cars...no cheapies....Wabenzi. @hlengani khuvutlu Roelofse. He did some of the investigations into Mdluli. "These corrupt Crime Intelligence people were so busy stealing money that we had no ""Intelligence""....only ""Crime"" taking over all of our lives."
clive oconnell,Is there anybody not taking advantage ie thieving from state funds? Pastor We‚Äôre not ANC appointees Nobody‚Äôs ever become an ANC Freedom Fighter to stay poor. Zuma couldn‚Äôt have that size family without many large donations from friends? Like Mandela family all so poor. Jesus only had 12 men friends üë¨ Moses Talk to your imaginary J friend. And stop sending your üí© Moses Aren‚Äôt they all your Gods? children üë∂ Moses üí°off I prefer lesbians in full HD mostly ü§£ Stacy Why are black peoples flooding to White countries? "Jeawa Where if you are paying into pensions "Afrikaners Church believers in segregated people Jack üëçüèΩ "Jimmy Bringing Jesus
Pastor J.J,You and I for starters @clive oconnell .hahahahaha @clive oconnell . True but even if I was I am certain and sure I will still be driving my 20year old Jalopy. @Sanjay Maharaj ....Naughteeeeee boy. @Sindiswa Moolman ....And so they said. Something needs to happen soon. Confidence amongst the population will bring great benefits. "I will also at some stage soon see a similar Inquiry and or approach with some Churches and Pastors who are fleecing mostly the poor. Any Pastors on the chat that share this view. If not @Sindiswa Moolman .... I absolutely do and I respect a lot of the negative sentiments expressed so often. It certainly has substance. @Sanjay Maharaj I fully agree @clive oconnell @Sindiswa Moolman . I certainly did. I the went into Ministry and retired even more poor. Hahahahahahaha but true. then @Sanjay Maharaj That should and is the ideal approach but sadly does not happen in practice most of the time @KQ-O American Lady Very very well said. Bless you @Moses Sandile I cannot discriminate or be judgemental. sorry mybrother. Belive it or not. Marimuthu is an ex Policeman that became a prominent Pastor in Phoenix. I will not be drawn into what many see as controversial. Times have changed and the views of the Church should as well to a large extent. @Moses Sandile I did many times. I have a Degree in Theology as well. I am not sure what response you are expecting from me. @Moses Sandile ...Ok...Ok....enough said @Rahaman Khan You are indeed right. @Beno Beno To say the least........... No religion advances homosexuality. It is a Societal issue and a matter of personal choice. Scriptures was intended to be a guide to how we live but has also taught us tolerance and acceptance. @Moses Sandile . The Church has many facets and Leaders with differing view points. "@Moses Sandile I consider myself to be honest @I Am Free Precious Mom. Mums are never wrong. well sometimes Alert from SABC Digital....We apologise for the lack of sound. The Technician/Tea Person has fallen asleep.
hlengani khuvutlu,wh0 is this @JS thanks maybe south africa will be clean south africa must have a special police not the hawks and NpA WHEN ARE WE GOING TO ARREST
Sanjay Maharaj,a piggy bank? is that a slur on Roleofse's apperance? I want to see this Col. Naidoo. I want to know who he naid ü§£ü§£ü§£ still has to find its way to courts "nah. it starts with us on the ground. if we do not get ourselves literate "if every citizen took to the streets in an orderly manner and simply said to the NPA that they must move on these investigations and bring them to a head by March 2020 ü§£ s'tru that the curse of Africa is its people that allows themselves to be pulled to the sway of corrupt leaders. They put petty tribalism and superstition above principle. "you know Afri forum and the way they work is exactly why that Nats what? the big white oke is a lady? "pastor John verushka verushka September. he coloured father came for the curry and stayed for a bonk ü§£ü§£ God's work done and done well Clive you clearly have not been to rural kzn. okes there have full villages of wives and children without a cent born free who? then you mean embrace family planning. not stop breeding. who will play soccer for ZA if that happened? wazzup! actually not. no procreation is no procreation. family planning is responsible procreation @moses nothing doin boss. fasting. Time of our ancestors @moses my China it is not our breeding rates. it is us dying young from too much curry you mean like Henri van breda? or that minownoke offensive to her or you? either wya it was said in Hest and not meant as a slur. so go play in traffic for all I care @paul. me too...

Born free,Wow I respect Mr Roelefse he must take these crooks down. The Rot of Africa So wonderful to have a well spoken witness and not sound familiar like eeeee eeeeh eeee Afriforum will see to it that the NPA do their job. Minerals have nothing to do with these crooks in Crime Intelligence Zuma is in big financial trouble and he will know what it is like to be poor again because of his lack of leadership and governance. They must stop breeding " Zuma how will you support your family when your home is liquidated and sold? Only intelligent Blacks practice family planning Everyone must practice family planning.. children cost money and you must ensure they have an equal opportunity in life to be educated and upstanding citizens Henri chose to take drugs "exproprite Nkandla give it to the poor haha Zuma no one will buy Nkandla they are afraid of the ghosts so I guess you will be able to stay their and pay rent to the tribal Chief. Zuma you must pay your bond nothing is free. Zuma you borrowed alot of money from the VBS.. please pay your bond. Zuma.. I am not a wealthy person just a middle class and I am not from your apartheid era. I am proudly Rhodesian Those people that wrote the Bible were closet gays They hid behind their own scriptures just like the Popes and Cardinals do. Jesus could have been Gay Zuma.. some are born to be gay I am a spiritualist I think Jesus was gay Jesus was born in September and not December. SoWhat about the lesbianism Mary had an affair with her cousins husband and that is how Jesus came to be. It was John the Babtists father. Oh great some comedy the Zumas in reality TV ü§£ü§£ü§£ I know the descendants of Jesus I will email the proof to you.. Moses Whites were the first Blacks to migrate from Africa.. Darwin's theory of evolution not mine Neither am I Zuma I am very happy but not gay Stacey.. don't be stupid.. read my comment it makes perfect sense. The same reason Blacks are in Europe and Britian is to escape Africa Blacks are migrants in European countries Moses aka Zuma won't have any land or home very soon Zuma expropriate Nkandla give it to the homeless The Arabs were the first to capture blacks in the slave trade Zuma you will have to pay whites for all the infrastructure they designed and paid for
