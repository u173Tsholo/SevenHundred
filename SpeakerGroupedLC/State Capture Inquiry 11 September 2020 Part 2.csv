Byron Noemdoe,Let's Go South Africa :) someone fell thru the roof? is anyonne really following here or are we just getting fame it was thunder i wonder how this commission will conclude someday did Zuma leave office after or during his term? if after then everyone is innocent 2024 is too far something is gonna happen in the ANC some reshuffling if i followed i could actually understand i wasnt born under a rock or maybe i was haha 🙂 on table mountain SIMBA there's tons of evidence my word the guy with th emarron tie is boss investigators checked that's the problem. what's law. if you have memos emails and bank account details signed off by the police and whoever else but no law firmly stands until this commission gets someone to admit the problem is that there were suppose to be tapes end of point because they are missing so who stole them concord court has the tapes lol different laws for different situations. this court can only have access to certain evidence the rest is high profile should charges be laid that's my own understanding "i think the commission is trying to cuff with as little mess as possible you can't take it straight to the highest court in the land because what does it say of our judiciary system you see great example for africa and reflection of our country to the world. no killing like in mali we have patience and get the job done fair and square we should all be working from home forever more that's major inc yes and work material must be provided by the work. only going into the office for monthly meetings or important events family time is important and more than that peace of mind someone must play devils advocate here "do we think corruption is bad management or criminal activity? we all know crime "lol look what happened to america with one president this is going to take time. If you need wealth i have "I'm assuming Kinship 3K """May Justice Be Served..."" - King Byron Major XVI" nevermind TV probably fill up the dome all together hey cassper? Innocent till proven guilty that's LAW oh is he's name Zondo? Mondli dankie 5G is obvious Covid - that headache feeling radiation lunytune haha thanks for the blessing blind siren lol pj the way the chair says tsotsi hahahahahahhaha to much sauce in the frying pan that's what a rothschild says just make it taste nice in the bolonaise pasta guys man character is on your face. let the man go and bring in the next unless there is some intel about OTHER people you can tell us sir something like GREEN hahahaha i like proper nouns GREEEN i've got money go to old mutual and say NOEMDOE 25 Billion i have with them and 2.2 billion with compuscan in us dollars haha that's unfortunate why dont you take the gautrain i own income taxes. its a long story but it started in VErsailles "most people dont pay that fee of the etol madiba made me prince pointless feelings like pink ballet shoes there's a wall here that can't be broken. that is what is court decision does not the arguments half0time the same as that sailor from the technicolor cartooons POPEYE thigh please lololololol very bad it kills i think this is sharing will the nation they know they know you know what i mean a b c easy as 1 2 3 loadshedding is an act that i can't uderstand krokadil?????? what's that yooooooooooooooooo that's a golden duck the wall is that can a country afford to put many politicaians to jail at once or only one like in South Korea with their PM u see? real life Dream hahaha hungry for spam me JAH!!!!!! "i would hate to be a minister hahaha but FAMOUS BILLIONAIRE im in crazzy by beyonce @abc haha lamb curry We want a home run now Corruption? Where 2? Amandla... Awethu i thought Zuma was untouchable then loook what happened and to an extent its still happening to him. Now this "How do you prove what the commission is trying to prove in one move? A ""checkmate""" hahaha Curry is a toilet's worst nightmare but my stomach's favourite dream did you steal and eat the biscuit or not? SIMPLE first place for me too bank accounts it's not that easy to get money overseas offshore unless in another corrupt african bank somewhere on the continent MALI that's why it happened there recently it will come together on the continent like a book because the leaders are all in it together AU everything is obvious just write a STATE CAPTURE for DUMMIES article in the newspaper for us south africa home run completed "both sides home run too much sauce in the frying pan :) "he's ""wondering"" how and why? ;)" true hey i like your monkey but where are the ferarris? how is the money spent because an execujet is a couple hundred grand to dubai but billions that's like something else. oh the guptas took the money to india i see now im literally making curry at home now like downstairs now hahahahaha now that makes sense a cartel is big you mustve been employee of the month the entire career then why so many empyu seats? it's saturday guys hahahaha when does the season start this time around?

Frank Jordaan,What was that noise. Thobani I hope someone informs us. Hanky panky at Escom😁😁😁😜 NOXOLO very important point. He brushed them of in order to frustrate them and force them to resign. That was the plan. His justification is so flawed it is laughable Doctor you are so right. The Guptas saw a huge oppertunity Zolile I also did a back flip when I heard that. Just unbelievable the depths these corrupt vultures went to to destroy the lives and careers of very capable people Now telling us that he had the interest of us citizens at heart. Mondli you hit the nail on the head. First he tried to blame Thotsi and now Dentons. Slimy one this. What a nice place to work for. First suspend you for no reason and then pay you a year's salary to go away. The lady doth protest too much. Thulani so right. Nice to give away R18m if it is not your money. Once again an important document not signed Brilliant DCJ Lucas he will fight it to the limit

NOXOLO GUMEDE,Well played AdvSeleka! No freaking deepdive nonsense... Just idiotic fraudsters nje! Where are the emails of these 3 execs saying they don't want to cone vack?!
Alkhas Bagwan,m I in ni
Kevin Simon,Dog and pony show. Most of it. Not all of it. What the chair has done has been to rubbish their reasons for the dismissals. This leaves them open to being implicated in the facilitation of the Gupta appointees. "Wizz kid Never arose is not an answer. What did you know and when. Critical questions our people can't answer. What DCJ is about to say is critical! The same happened at SAA. Burning platform. New board. No clue. BUT took major decisions...... clear pattern. All of them are easily swayed by conspiracy theories. Naive to the core. I'm about 3 min behind but it is clear DCJ knows much more than we do. Well done to the commission and it's investigators. Kudos for sticking to the task 👏 This guy was a Molefe cheer leader.
Thulani Masuku,Yes the plotting was done somewhere outside and you played along
Douglas Masuku,"when someone dances well "Mondli right eddy What due diligence did the minister and the board exercise before transferring Molefe to Eskom? Jugde Excellent putting the pieces of the puzzle together "Nells Oom Ben is tired So they will not talk about the cash suitcases after the curry dinners at Saxonwold
BEE-llionaire Okwacha,What? But Ngubane expect us to believe the dung he is explaining white collar criminals in South Africa should carry life in prison for embezzling public funds since death sentence is regarded unconstitutional.
jozi line,Ramos manipulated the rand did they ask about contracts about exxaro
Esha Esha,🤣
Sphamandla Mdluli,lol the way CDJ is laughing. He can see Dr. is not making sense and lying
Elias Mabusela,"yes dokta magubane
Wesley M,yoh and this was the chairman of the Eskom board.. Lord have mercy on t south Africa father please help us. so what's going to happen with the money that is coming from the IMF. people like Dr Ben and them going to deal with this money. Lindiwe Zulu and them. Lord have mercy Nooooooo!!!! "another question how did dr Ben become a doctor a wizkid are you serious??? when is Lynne Brown coming to testify??
BOIKANYO MOLOI,so it was more blunders blunders or liers "tjo billions and billions of Rands @bee-llionaire what I've observed is that White Collar Crime isn't punishable enough in #Mzansi basically you can get away with it eix @Derek Main it's sad indeed so tension made him not to have integrity so English is so difficult to understand @KeeganMoodley they appeared last year but I think they will have another round

Brinco Barasta,Hirstus 😂😂😂😂 Dr what? @Mondli the looting formula
Cecilia Sissing,advocate is now going in for the jugular chairperson is the bomb "when adv s smiles @obert😉
Derek Main,Criminal negligence. "@BOIKANYO MOLOI I agree - white collar crime goes unpunished. But unfortunately most crime in SA goes unpunished. In SA @Charles Maluleke He's just trolling. @Kevin Simon The fact that he says he knew nothing of Molefe's criminal actions at Transnet when it was public knowledge beggars belief. It's BS. @Keegan Moodley Robben Island is not big enough. @Aubrey De Bliquy Probably still being looted. @Mondli Nohashe We need to design new uniforms for them with a target on heir backs. "Just so it's clear to everyone @Nathaniel Motlhasedi Yes - all orchestrated by the Guptas.
