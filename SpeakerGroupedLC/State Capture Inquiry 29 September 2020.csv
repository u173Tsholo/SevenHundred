He is a criminal No Mr Sodi . As taxpayers we need to know your monies @Theo Bhengu. Yhu ! The word Nomvulo How can you forget the reason for paying someone R1m ? This is another Gavin Watson.

Andre Gerber,Zuma scared of DCJ any excuse not to testify I hope DCJ say something Zuma gave him the job as chairperson no court will rule in Zuma's favour because he decided on the commission chairman it's just the Zuma tactics No chat on eNCA watching SABC with eNCA sound @Sibongile T no chat on eNCA @abc what do you think of the Nthuli case sentence @Sibongile T few seconds delay in @abc true for the position he had should have been 20 years @wim louw he got 5y hy sal binne 4 maande uit wees who is this banana Sodi helped yesterdays witness to buy property and also gave permission for him to build houses there's a lot of building companies who have plumbers electricians etc in one BEE = Bread (money) Eat Enough and in the meantime your company gets paid for management services same as the Guptas
Kgotso Mpete,it seems like Zuma is causing the delay for today 😂😂😂 so this gentleman was so generous and giving millions to friends and people who get to be in high government positions 😂😂😂 he is throwing the ANC under the bus now 😂😂😂😂 take him chair 😂😂 BEEE is showing us flames😂😂 "they must hire this guy at Luthuli house Supra Mahumapelo thursday cheers guys

Alright... see you guys on the other side... @Andre Gerber oh... then never mind... I'd rather stay here if that's the case... The sound engineer has been captured... @Andre Gerber I was just about to comment how messed up SA's judiciary system is... even when they get caught they get like 5 friggin' years!! @Andre Gerber how messed up is that... "@Andre Gerber what makes it worse is that if it was you or me... we'd likely get a harsh sentence But oh well... Seems pretty confident this one... But I feel like they're gonna put the shine on his head... @Craig he'll likely be out before then...

This guy thought he was Michael... Baldy is flexing us now... 😅 "This guy thought we ""couldn't stop this thrillah""... he was wrong" Generosity... another word for bribery... He'll be asking for water soon... This well-dressed apple has a worm inside... @Eddy Reddy completely rotten... So he was a fanboy...?? He needs to wake up and smell the coffee... he only likes ANC because he's not poor... Zondo is in dreamland by now... @Yolo More lol 😅 Looks like another chap will walk free... Wannabe Michael is gonna moonwalk his way straight to jail... He's eloquently spewing nonsense... @Mike Clark 😅😅 Right on bro!

On this guy's evidence my friends need to step up.😎 Guy was ANC wage clerk Hope this guy doesn't drive to the airport alone. Waffle........... Same here. Voted for the first time in 1994 at age 34. Disenfranchised before that. Looting is part of the DNA. I think not. I'm sure Ace knew about all these schemes in the Free State. Top six as well. However it was a way of funding the party which was short of funds. At risk means should mean that the project was for their cost until satisfactorily completed?
Rasheed Ally,Not surprisingly Black's will re colonise SA . Note no white person is called for corruption ? yet they own economy? NPA will never go for WMC &some blacks aid them .

Tay,Mr Sodi's lips are ALREADY turning white! He is exuding too much confidence kkkkkkk Sordid affair with Moeketse I'm now thinking his hyper-form may be attributed to some ganja influence "That's possibly correct chair  page 404 is bad news for him How can you be a proud member yet you are not a member??? 😁 As said chair.... smooth criminal The bulk of the payments.. and I need to check the dates.. because i never got to analyse..but I'm confirming that Aaaaah this guy ka? Now he had business relationship with his father? No recollection mode kicks in... Friend of mine but I cant remember ANC T-Shirts and campaign material what was it for? to Paul Mashatile "Assist with Donations Not accounted for ? "She is someone I consider as a sister The list goes on and on...Government officials. He can remember minute bona-fide payments but not shady millions to individuals Payments to him in his personal capacity payments to him as a friend 20 k there 30 k there ANC is accused number 1...President's own words You have already opened a can of fully of worms Money opens any door for him Typically that is how the industry operates. smooth criminal of all time "Okay Mr Sodi His statement that he is not a card carrying member of the ANC is self incriminating... He is well spoken and he has been using this attribute to get away with dirty deals... He is very cunning and he knows too much about the happenings within Government Zondo is uncharacteristically quiet Zuma has gotten DCJ by the balls @Fireman nope! never He admits now He digging an escape hole through Mr Mbambani It's a game of mafioso "The ANC should appear before the Commission and be represented by Elias Sekgobelo ""Ace"" Magashule" @Alan White precisely my point as well When you submit a bid for a tender you should declare that you meet the required competencies It was unethical he admits Mr Sodium is used to long arguments with fellow crooks @Sandile Mkhonto Mr Sodi bribed government and ANC officials to get Government contracts There are elements of money laundering in some of the transactions
Pheladi Lamola,I doubt Jimmy Tau can lie like these other professional liars. They must bring him here to spill At some point the likes of Mdluli looked untouchable. I'm glad that's no longer the case So he just let go of rental income? Oh. Did Mr Mokhesi pay extra then? Yoh people are raking moola in out there 🙆🏾‍♀️ Of course you support the ANC. You're benefiting from them.

"government officials getting ""assistance""" Consruction projects are the most corrupt in the world. easy to overstate costs "@Sandile "from Wikipedia "kickbacks or bribes
Apparently Allegedly mokoena,mentioning Parys equals corrupt. This investment should be investigated Did the government ask for documents in order to be sure that sodium had the accreditation?

"But there was no need for him to disclose because the department knew that he doesn't have since it was as a result of corruption He can't be given a job simply because he did in Gauteng without qualifications Zwane is obviously joining Zuma tyoyi-tyoyi Zwane is imitating baba tyoyi-tyoyi is resistance against Zondo kkkk He is contradicting himself now because firstly he said he was going to appoint accredited personnel

Cbo Ngubane,Maybe this is what Zuma referred to when he said he going to talk. Lots of names so mentioned.. @Josiah Mashashane what is a tyoyi tyoyi? @Josiah Mashashane 😂😂😂😂 @Tim Diale who are those?
Xolkwa,Ag tog! I thought this Mr Sodi was not African considering his generosity. It's encouraging to learn the contrary. But stealing from government to feed governing party leaves much to be desired. Eloquent liar this is
Malik Langa,@Fireman Because the boy payed his faction @Antoinette Meyer😂😂😂 I saw that! @Mduduzi Thabede A Thabede Commission?😂 "Mr Mpambani can't speak for himself @Mduduzi Thabede Sekuvikwa ngaye la.

Temezulu Tshabalala,you dont need matric to be a billionaire.but u can hire qualified personnel to make u billions.
Absolom 'ABSA' Nhorito,My question is who will interrogate Mr ChiefJustice Zondo since he was appointed by the President and (2)Is he going to prosecute the President and his Cronies.The truth is TAX PAYERS MONEY IS WASTED Anyone who took money and share with the poor e.g J Zuma are going to be interogated and victimised to those who serve the White monopoly agenda and ideas will not be harrased watch the space. @Craig Johnson you are wrong and you talking from a biased perspective.Im talking the money for the mass the black people who contribute more to the tax rate while getting peanuts.Africa has been sold

My view is procurement is just a looting business... Let this commission close shops and NPA driven investigation takes The industry is corrupt... This one takes us for fools... Mr Tau must be called just to expose his (Sodi )lies... It’s irrelevant whether he was paid in his personal capacity or not...
Timothy Fynn,"this clown actually thinks he is talking circles around the commission Zondo for President.
