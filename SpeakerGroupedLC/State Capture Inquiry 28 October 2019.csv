Born free,Gateway to Guptas Estina Gupta owned project Shoot the moon That's R30 million what about the other R19 million? It was a SCAM made of pirated outdated parts So how much of all the millions did Thabete gain for himself? from this operational scam. Thabete did not practice oversight because he was beniffing personally The scam was built with our taxpayers money Was Thabete appointed by the Guptas? Trump has slapped heavy sanctions on the Guptas. He has been following this corruption. I am a Trump patriot.. cannot and do not agree with you.
