Watson is gonna pin him to all this mess. he is gonna play ignorant. They had a vault of cash. why worry over about minor salary on this well DA saw nothing wrong with steenhuisen leading without matric. partiality is still deeply rooted in this country.

Mpho Tsedu,10 minutes adjournment in favour of the witness - we are in true Constitutional Democracy. What if witness does not return? DCJ Zondo is giving Venter a long rope. @carnoth ngomane Certainly Where is the main man - Gavin Watson? When is he comin forward to clean his name? Peet's rope is getting longer and he is slowly entangling himself therein. "Sound problems? Tell me of ""sabotage""."

Gxobilahle KaGandaya,Hahahah @Desmond Masilela Even their neighbours; life partners kids; schools where kids go; shops where they buy bread; where they fill up petrol...everything about BOSASA must go under scrutiny.

Or at least he looks like some netball coach or golf hahahah @Walton "Why is the tie Lets Compare Gupta and BOSASA ... Which is a better devil? Question is...Who is worse and more sophisticated between Gupta and BOSASA? The problem in SA is people vote with their skin color and principles later "At some point Mbeki was a people's favorite @Cameron Kim ....and is most admired by the Pres The sons of Presidents ...should be continuously investigated even if there is nothing wrong. There tend to be dodgy dealings left unscrutinised Perhaps its the sufficient reason their salaries should be reviewed so family and sons cannot be lured to wrongs Should they be salaried ...to start with?

"@Thami Ngwenya Too many ""Zumas"" in the ANC." @Thami Ngwenya You misunderstand - there are too many ANC members who are every bit as corrupt as Zuma. They will never fix corruption because they are feeding at the trough. "@Thami Ngwenya While I agree with you on Tshwane and JHB @makhosi nobhatyi Ramaphosa was there when all this corruption was (and is still) happening. He did nothing and he's implicated. @Cameron Kim You're a Trump supporter!!!! That explains a lot. @Musa Bakiti I doubt it @Tholithemba Ntsele Zuma epitomises the ANC @Kapn Krunch And protected and supported Zuma all the way through his state capture. @Kapn Krunch Capitalism means you do anything to maximise profits - no matter who or what you stand on in the process. Capitalism rewards sociopaths. @Kapn Krunch No it's not that simple if you live in a capitalist system - you can't not be a capitalist if you live in a capitalist system. "@Kapn Krunch Under capitalism @Magda Seguin Nothing wrong with conspiracy theorists - I'm proudly one myself. @Musa Bakiti What are you asking JZ to clean? @Magda Seguin No - I'm not.

Thulani Bukani,@Mapoto why not trust the judge? I wonder why Fils and the guy from yesterday with the EFF pic are never online at the same time. Im sure it would be quite entertaining to see them go head to head. Perhaps they are the same person? @cameron I agree with you. TRC never prosecuted one implicated person who didn’t come forward to tell their story and ask for forgiveness. Not one. I also blocked Fils but I can see he is stressing out brothers and sisters out. @cameron if you can educate me about the EFF thieves I’d be grateful. ANC are a bunch of thieves that goes without question. EFF I’m not so sure.
Granny Mokwena,is this the same guy who claimed yesterday that he wasn't involved in anything illegal at Bosasa?
