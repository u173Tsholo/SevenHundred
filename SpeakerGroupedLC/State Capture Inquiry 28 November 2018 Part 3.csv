dave east,whar whats her name @Luckey Binali what did u say @Luckey Binali prove the eff is racist how is the eff violent violent in what way. speaking for the poor black majority is right. we have been displaced and are politically fighting to making things right so voting so black people can control their own future isnt worth voting 4 voting so we can control and have institutions built and governed by our children is worth 1 minute ticketing a box vote eff they want land and control to nationalize institutions so the prople benefit from the resources @Khothatso Khiba ANC is not for black people. they have had 25 years and we south africans are poor while white and indians are rich of our land and resources
Nkosikhona Ginya,this is zuma day Zuma and His friends were always looking for someone who was going to be their gateway to everything... its bad because this was pure manipulation of innocent people who wanted to serve the country "yeah maleka was trying to explain that he has no issues against Manyi as he suggested

Ewald Kruger,@Luckey Binali Agree fully. Only reason to vote for the DA is the chances of getting service delivery is better ðŸ˜ƒ Should one not think more pragmatically @Luckey Binali? Only reason I would vote for the DA is not because of their policies and values bla-bla but chances potholes will be fixed etc. I can see Jimmy pooping in his pants next time we see him here @Andre Gerberâ€‹ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ he will pitch with his own @Andre Gerber He asked Maleka? ðŸ˜€ @Andre Gerber ðŸ˜€ can't stop laughing @Andre Gerber "Will have a look "ðŸ˜€ @Nkosikhona Ginya.
