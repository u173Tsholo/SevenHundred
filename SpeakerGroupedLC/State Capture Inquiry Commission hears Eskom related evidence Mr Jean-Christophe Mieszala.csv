Chaaaaaai I am visibly living those corrupt days through the lady's testimony

f_society,this women is a SQL Db lol she knows the date and time of the event lol...
Frederick Von Abel,What is the problem with the DA? It lost other 2 wards to the ANC yesterday after 3 of its Coloured councilors resigned claiming racism. @zip reeper It's supporters still talk as if they have all the answers
L. M,the racist DA lost 2 wards to the glorious ANC in the by-elections yesterday in the Western Cape. The EFF still won NONE😂🙋‍♀ @ZAG Consultants 🖤💚💛💪 @Mzalwane Mzala the trend will continue this way
Lesedi Seetseng,she's lying @Russia she's spilling the beans
Jenny Whitewaves,@zip reeper i left the DA because it had no clear direction the DA has fallen between two stools. It lost the white support by playing black but wasn't black enough to claim black voters It should start to have some policies which appeal to all colours
Zweli Mkosana,DA is not only too white but a racist political party. you can see all those National Party elements in it. Madam Zille was brought back to clean up her mess of all those black people she brought into the white party. when they on the streets they black in parliament they white ANC was no more when they recalled Mvunyelwa Mbeki. imigodoyi took over a political party that looks like ANC. zondo commission is the reason of imigodoyi as it was their turn to eat. team break 😂😂😂 can someone who's close to duduzane zuma ask him to shave his head south africans would like to see the shape of his head so as to really confirm if he is indeed gedleyihlekisas son. "we is this mess because of the following people as they were prepared to die for zuma if he doesn't become the president. julius Malema Nkosazana dlamini - zuma did not believe in JZ zuma as she supported Thabo Mbeki she looks like Khusela Diko not in that way @ Gala😂😂😂
Mzalwane Mzala,"The DA is @Tebogo V Whose bitter ex is she? "@mfundo Me and the lady have the same boo in our hands same book not boo. Yeh @Mfundo Mavimbela was Zuma's DG before. Ok @Mfundo The ANC lost one ward to the Land Party in the Overstrand municipality. Mr Van Rooyen lied Where is Eric Woods? @ZAG Consultants The ANC gained 3 in Mpumalanga and 2 in Western Cape. @ZAG Consultants The 3 Mpumalanga wards are in Bushbuckridge and they were previously held by BETTER RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION @L. M and @ZAG Consultants it was an almost perfect day for the ANC @Mfundo I will wait to see the outcome of the integrity committee. @L.M It is in line with last month's elections. @Mfundo what is needed are effective state investigation and prosecuting institutions. The Integrity committee is an aside DispatchLIVE understands that the Hawks are collecting documents relating to BCM's R30m food voucher tender. The ANC nearly took a third ward from the DA in Outshoorn. The DA's majority was just 14 votes. It can no longer claim that it does not mind when councilors resign. WC victory is no longer certain. @Kgabi Nyao I mean the Integrity Committee. On top of that he is charged in a court of law @Lerato Moleke The last address of Cyril that we saw was the president's NEC closing rearks. closing remarks @Lerato Moleke You have done nothing wrong so far. We need the corporate type to input The reality is that even with press conferences it will be difficult fr Ace to address and the whole event not turn into a frenzy for corruption-related questions that are about him. The ANC got 70.8% support in yesterday's by-elections. @dee dee cocroft try campaign for your party among voters "@Lerato Moleke Mavimbela claims @dee dee cocroft You're so smart that you can't convince people to see your point of view and you resort to insulting them Brilliant indeed! @Quinton van Eeden Are you disillusioned with democracy?

What they mean is follow the scientists we agree with. Who needs WHO if covid mortalities include symptoms like a bullet in the brain? 😂 "@Naledi Barron Hello Has anyone been watching the USA 2020 election farce? Trumps strength is in the depravity of his adversaries. This is epic. Legislatures in the battle ground states are being challenged by SCOTUS to name their delegates consistent with the constitution or accept corrupt elections. @Shari Mattera Democracy dies in the darkness of secrecy. Only scoundrels prefer it's cover. NSA keeps private details of every voter in perpetuity but forensics of fair elections cannot be deleted fast enough. @Shari Mattera Battle ground states have been sued at SCOTUS and SCOTED ha given them until today to respond. This is epic. US constitution mandates state legislatures the dutyto nominate delegates. And the battleground states are mostly Republican majority states. Interesting. @Shari Mattera You cannot deny we live in interesting times. The internets makes it possible to do our own fact checking if we wish. How much of these link problems is acidental and how much a pretext to consult councel. Interesting?

Still the grea🌈test country. @Shari Mattera @Louis C I get to alternate between red wine and diabetis and legal stoep dagga.

It is too late once people have seen it for what it is. "People still think a Biden injection is about covid.

No ways the nubers suport a Biden victory. numbers @Shari Mattera Democracy dies in the darkness of secrecy. No way does the fiasco in USA elections indicate a biden victory unless your reality is spawned by CNN and ABC news. "@Nash Dube The constitution mandates state legislatures as the final arbiter of delegates for POTUS. We will see what happens. America is divided I never supported Trump. I supported Congresswoman Major Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii but they did not want America to hear her. "But I supported Democracy If South Africa chjose ANC we must helo them succeed. You don't attack the taxi driver while you are speeding down the highway. @Naledi Barron Trump preaches beigernance but never started the wars Obama or Bush started. Judge a tree by it's fruit. "@Nash Dube I admit I am biased. I love the idea of a government for the people @Maritime Studies That is why we must enlighten people about truth and never give up. We will fnd one another if we do. @Nash Dube Yes. I admit I am in favour of survival of the species. I am biased. I don't support DA because they are not representative of our ethnic diversity and ANC and EFF and IFP are little better.. So I stand in the middle conscientiously. I wont be part of the problem. @Nash Dube I think the climate change issue is just another distraction from the real issues. 90 years of particle physics is the ultimate exercise in futility. We are in the dark ages of science. The LHC and the boson particle is like crashing jumbo jets into mountains and poring over the debris to reverse engineer fight. We are in a dark age of science. South Africa has everything we need for abundance. Food self sufficiency and the highest grade Neodymium reserves on the planet which the freedom charter claims as ours. So 100 years ago he fundamental physics of gravity was abandoned in the face of Einstein's bent space-time mind fv<kery. We are still in the dark ages impoverishing mankind to abundance. @Naledi Barron Tesla said one day we will connect our machines to the wheelwork of nature. That remains to be achieved and is no less possible today than 100 years ago. It's a page for our scholars John Searl "SAFIRE We have no neef for scarcity. It is sunthetic. synthetic Fo<k die Illuminati. Laat ons vir ons frek ook. @Naledi Profssor John Searl built a plasma turbine in the 40s and 50s. He was arrested and his turbine confiscated and declared top US military secrecy status in 1952. @Naledi Barron We live in an abundant world of synthetic scarcity engineered to entrench paraistes to power. No more need for oil or coal or nuclear fission. Or an eskom grid for that matter which dcould be smelted down to make a free energy plasma turbine for every home in South Africa. @Naledi Barron If you conceal science you create synthetic sarcity. The agenst od this scam are by definition not public though te record is there to find if you are vigilant. @Naledi Barron I have no doubt. The research never becomes public. I am doing my bit on a SASSA pensioners change. "Design of experiments DOE is a strategy for asking wuestions of nature "It is a circular logic "Searl made a magnetic ""sun"" ring with planetary rollers. A frictionless magnetic bearing which acts as a HV gyroscopic plasma diode harvesting plasma electron flow as we harvest wind and water flow." "Gravity is a infinitely tiney bye product of electric and magnetic forces 10^36 greater. Surprise @Maritime Studies I am ready to direct the experiments using DOE. This is research that has never been done because we already know the answers. Imagine a world with no more petro dollar or war or the need for fiat money. @Naledi Barron No problem. Barter is the opposite of the tyranny of fiat money. People miss the point that centralized authority is by its nature destructive to the extent it can err. Whether it is the communist party of China or the deep state of Banana republic of America. Bye @ALTA @Naledi. The alternative is what we are doing. Sharing our ideas in humility and mutual respect. Truth is to be found in the free market oc uncensored ideas and creative thought. @Kopz Koape Exactly China is no mre a boogey man than the USA paragon of liberty and virtue. That is why I am prud to be South African. warts and all. @Naledi Barron Life is the art of the possible which begets the probabale and the inevitable.

Arthur Edington wen to Africa to prove at solar eclipse that the sun's gravity bends starlight even though he just proved refraction at the plasma limb of the sun as a stick appears bent in water.

"@Naledi Barron Simple refraction indeed "@Naledi Barron Simple refraction indeed But now we use a circular theory of black holes and false einstein rings to honor a bishop who subjugated his scientific objectivity to another creationist myth.

Haaibo 🤭🤭🤭 Agreed re Cyril!!! @Thami Mak'nyiwe Mhlanga I think its so messy that we depend on the fact the these advocates are 'professional' and dont carry biases. The same is to be said for Dali Mpofu and his wide array of anti-ANC clients SABC should have had retrenchments along with MANY governemtn departs...over staffed...expensive staff...poor capability...IN GENERAL @Peter Chakwenya I hope these current happenings will allow those world cup cases to come up...never mind how much corruption/bribery is required to win a Soccer World Cup Puppet! Well prepared speech non commital in his answers Puppet! Well prepared speech @Anti Suz Dont read whats not relevant to you! Hawu...leave the chatters to chat @Aubrey De Bliquy why would their delegates be secret anyways? @Aubrey De Bliquy Wont the delegates be known and named in the process of handing over anyways? "@Anti Suz This is not an official platform for anyone - so you are certainly not getting appropriate opinions here...go to a news room @Aubrey De Bliquy - Yes i would expect delegates to be named on time..but with the chaos pre-during and post elections...its best for me to just watch. yrr French signal sucks!!! 😂😂😂😂 First world for who?!? mxim "@Aubrey De Bliquy True!

Dont make the assumption that criminals have shame...they are probably walking with their chests out to brag how they duped a system. They are probaly the role models of the fraud and corruption world Its all over the news Angelo He has finally struck! The issue in the ex-republican states is that their nomination will have to hand power over to the democarts..ie..the people nominated will also present that Deomcratics win...which seems hard forthem Hers an 3 min explanation of the stages in the US elections...literally there are stages to the process. i strongly disagree with the fraud claim. so I dont agree with ANY of your sentiment in that regard "No fraud was proven. Actually "From all the documentaries I watched its bidens time!! Amen Phansi trump Phansi @Aubrey perspective is key..you wearing blinkers will NOT change the reality of what has taken place Ripleys Believe it or not Exactly @Anne M. Who is fooling who This guys evidence was boring man Pleasant evening further all End of Day Russuua @Louis C I cant disagree re the nausea. I just think its important to be informed so that I dont get fooled by fools who push untrue narratives! Constant lies that destroy the world "LEts see @zip reeper Always my thought...but the US elections is a money game...all their Top 6 people are RICH folk...actualy WEALTHY Including Kamala "@Heather Durr and theres your answer...fake news is rife! yep it won some people elections before @Naledi Barron Yes we all have our POV. I just think its important to guide one another to learn how to decipher between whats fake news and whats not for example @Aubrey De Bliquy Oh...you practice race politics? only? ot should i say 'ethnic diversity' polictics Imagine no planning abilities...yet over staffed They must have felt like such mavericks...recommending such basic things @Aubrey De Bliquy agreed...we have very little reason to be struggling @zip reeper this isnt an ANC conversation..haawuuuu...Transnet is its own company...with employees..i doubt 100% of them are ANC members "@board is not fully operational...plans are not for boards to draw up incompetent employees have to this day not been dealt with "@Maritime Studies boards are deployed..staff members such as EXCO "Having worked in a state institution before Mr Fine is making sure that he is not seen as negligent in his role Whhhaatttt???????

Mzuyanda Mfuku,Hi @Shari Mattera They should make people outside go give testimony at our Embassies or High Commissions and take the oath there
Dominic Przybylski,Ask him to wear headphones. Too much echo. It does make a big difference when blocking them. "I remember speaking to an oil company exec responsible for Africa and asked him why they didn't do business in SA before 94. Reply ""too difficult to bribe officials before.""" @Sekgololo Johannes Exactly. Politicians are only interested in power and will lie in any way if it helps them to get it. The man worked so hard to 'look the other way' that he was 'shocked' by hearing about the corruption that was old news to just about everyone else in the country. @Sifiso C Myeni Government would collapse without 'consultants' to do the work cadres are supposed to do. Voters have confirmed in latest by-elections that they are very happy to be ruled by a criminal syndicate. Can we really say we live in a democracy when voters take no responsibility. "We have political parties who campaign based on the colour of their shirts "Heh! And we have a political party calling themselves 'economic freedom fighters' when their policies aim for the exact opposite """higher level of strictness' be strict that all misdemeanors are so well hidden they will never be found." It implies that they don't have to be 'ethical' if there is no 'risk' of being caught. @MIKE DURBAN Imperialist straw men.

Sekgololo Johannes,Trangove SC; Ngcukaitobi SC; and Chaskalson SC have all represented the President as they did others. What is the issue. "Cyril did not institute the SCC; it was Msholozi @John Everitt and if he failed it can only mean then the SCC had to be commissioned. That really has none to do with Cyril. @Thami Mak'nyiwe Mhlanga that is true. Simply because the President was also order to do something by the PP. Not merely just to support Pravin Duduzane Zuma's fortunes took the same trajectory as his father's presidency. That is the issue worth investigating. The Guptas and the Zumas finished this country. "Someoneplease tell me; what/which generic McKensey shud never be allowed to operate in this country; ever. KPMg as well shud not be allowed to operate here. What they did with that Rogue Unit nonsense is despicable "@Calvin Ndavheleseni I cannot wait @Cooler Cat remember you shud not expect honesty from politicians. They really are not seekers of the truth. In the ANC moist are their for cults and not ethics and pure moral leadership. "@Rahab Takalo Cyril will not have much to say You only do what the President pass to you. @Anne M. then there was that @Rahab Takalo that is the starting point. The DP position is just ornamental like a flower. @Pheladi Lamola Do not confuse a political issue with a legal issue. Additionally; what powers does the ANC constitution give tot he DP? Even the President cannot fire the SG. U c that political web? The person/authority on funds is the TG. Not simply the top 6. "@Pheladi Lamola I say we are in agreement. He was the first politician to get my vote. Seated here @Anne M. That i still cannot fathom myself. @Louis C the irony @Dan Brown u r killing me @Cooler Cat Imagine what the Guptas did with Zuma; they wud have finished us under NDZ. There is no dispute on facts that both CR17 and NDZ received donors. PPL r just hurt most ppl had more trust in CR17 hence he received more money. @SanFran Arnold They wud have had us for breakfast;brunch;lunch;dinner. Waste of time this witness
John Everitt,To Get The Facts Straight : Zuma TRIED To Avoid A Commission Being Established; But Ultimately Was Constitutionally FORCED To Do So By The Then Public Protector : Thuli Madonsela. Being In A Similar Way To JZ Loudly and Often Declaring That He Wants His Day In Court; But Then Intentionally Employing EVERY * Stalingrad * Possible Means NOT To Appear In A Court; Or The Commission The Sad / Dangerous Reality Is That MOST Of The Stolen Bux Will NEVER Be Recovered.

Ndivhuwo Sivhula,This guy is really trying to do some reputation damage. But McKinsey has been the shadiest consulting firm for years...globally.

Kopz Koape,@Salmaan Abrahams..In case you didnt know eastern cape did not exist prior to 1994 . Present day Eastern Cape just like western cape and northern cape was just called Cape province @Salmaan im aware are in 2020 however you said people from the present day eastern cape cannot claim land in western Cape. My response is you cannot forget about the history of SA "@Salmaan im aware land grabs are an issue all over SA.. However "@Salmaan..The implication was people claiming land are from eastern cape. Im saying east/west cape didnt exist prior to 94 "@Ismail peterson. You are aware that the area you are taking about was cape province @Ismail..Xhosas are from capetown too .But you won't accept that because you believe they are foriegners because helen zille or DA says so @Aubrey China is not fully a communist state it's a mixed economy @Ismail. the xhosas are from the cape province. As matter of fact xhosas are related to khoi khoi. Their language even some xhosas have the same features as the khoi @Ismail peterson..Jan found the khoi khoi in the cape but they migrated thousands of years before the settlers came to present day South Africa..The khoi arent indigenous to SA @Ismail peterson..You have read the wrong version of history.. Remember one thing history was written by the winners @Salmaan it's matter of semantics here😀 @Salmaan maybe you can answer the question ismail keeps avoiding how can a nomadic people be indigenous to SA when SA didnt exist prior to 1910..Also khoi are found in Namibia too @Maritime studies..Let me corret you its more of Zebra nation than rainbow nation @Ismail peterson .There were no khoi chiefs back then as they arent any now .You are not being honest now. Also sara baatman was a coloured slave @Ismail peterson .You cant nane one khoi chief. Truth is khoi dont exist as nation only their coloured decendants exist in SA In South Africa khoi and san are extinct.. However their coloured decendants are still here in South Africa @Shari in South Africa they are..Not in Namibia or Botswana @Shari Mattera .I don't you understand the people in the karoo you are talking about are coloureds not khoi or san .The khoi or san language is not spoken anywhere in SA. @Sam in Botswana.. San language is spoken..The tswanas there call them Basarwa @Shari..You say these so called khoi and san have kings and queens in SA. Name one @Shari..The people in karroo that you are talking about i have seen them .Why do they speak Afrikaans..The representative of the so called khoi san movement is john van rooyen and he speaks Afrikans @Tendani.. Right Batswana .But thats besides the point @Sam zed..The coloureds claiming to be khoi and san have an agenda..Its political. They know they are not khoi or san . @Sam zed. remember many of these coloureds will admit that they are mix between black and European and some malay @Tendani..No im not offended at all. It was a mistake on my part. Everyone makes mistakes @Shari..Thats what mixed race people prefer to be called .I guess you aint from SA @Sam zed..Most coloureds as I said are mixture between bantus and Europeans only few have khoi and san blood. Remember in SA khoi and san most were wiped out @Shari i see.. Westbury people are proud coloureds .So i dont understand why do you disagree @Shari..I have seen coloureds in Kimberly and kuruman in northern cape many claim to be namas but they speak Afrikaans and some have long hair and light skin..Explain that???
