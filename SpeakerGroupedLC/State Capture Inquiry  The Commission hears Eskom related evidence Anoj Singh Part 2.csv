I'ts time Chair let's Seleka do his job jirrie he's allowing Singh to run the commission ! "bottom line is all of these agreements  123 go @ALTA there you go easy as pie I appreciate Zondo's proffessionalism and knowledge BUT a nasty judge that takes no crap and hates corruption is what we needed !! @ALTA Arlo Guthrie Alice's restaurant @Louis C fog on the Tyne is mine all mine this crook has wasted a day .. but he's made it crystal clear why SA is in this mess !! this is what happens when you talk too much and try to be too cleaver !! If he had stayed with yes or no he would have been better off ! chair is now supporting Singh .. hoe nou ?? @Louis C learned friend is actually pathetic ...lyk my meeste van hulle het baie min geleer en hulle is niemand se vriend nie ! @Louis C ons het n hardegat judge nodig gehad vir hierdie kommissie wat korrupsie haat ! Dan sou dit nou al alles oor gewees het ! "@Louis C ek stem Zondo probeer om te veel legal arguments te explore .. ""it may well be"" kom te veel op en die gelag is onvanpas miljoene mense suffer as gevolg van hierdie diewe !" "@Louis C hierdie raak nou vervelig het jy geweet die Iere het in 1866 Canada binne geval ( en die beste deel is hulle rede ) ""we had nothing else to do at the time"" goeie styl !" imagine liewe heksie (terrible image) in a bikini catching a tan next to the pool .. jirrie sorry if that keeps you awake tonight:elbowcough: @Louis C ek ook my beste vriend hier in die verre is n Ier en hy besit n kroeg .. hy was deel van daai tyd en ek love sy stories ! @R Bauer haha yes the last thing anyone would want is a spell put on you by heksie .. could be lethal jirrie heksie is grasping at straws now or maybe her witches brew is ready at the haunted castle playing tired games now ...liewe heksies strategy ! @bruinman goeie naand ek is agter wat julle doen al die pad .. maar realisties die anc sal dit nooit laat gebeur nie .. dit sal hulle ontbloot ! @ bruinman ek bid jy's reg vriend jy het my ondersteuning

Aubrey De Bliquy,So if government obstructs a medicine that prevents Covid death have they not killed 3 times as many as covid?
Kevin1,Singh is spinning DCJ in his web !!! "The ""letter of acceptance"" would have been the agreement on which they commenced work" You are correct DCJ Singh is now playing with semantics - trying to be clever DCJ must let the process follow its course - he has now confused himself Correct DCJ But there was not an MSA in place at the time His meshing an SLA with and MSA is NOT correct and is smoke and mirrors Singh has achieved his next objective - creating confusion This is becoming a JOKE - Singh is laughing all the way back to his bank Finally they are getting to the point  Singh knows exactly what happened - he is spinning all these long stories so as to drag out the process and waist taxpayers money "He continues to sow confusion - if they merely draw the timeline as a picture on a blackboard Long story Singh is laughing - so is heksie All these bloody affidavits will result in nothing ever happening "If this was a boxing match today - Singh 8 / Commission 2 - i am not being negative @Valencia J my opinion - but the commission has not nailed the fact today @Valencia J i am still here - but the boxing match is moving to 50/50 as the DCJ is starting to get to grips with what is happening @Teunis van Ree @Valencia J i am hoping there will be a TKO - it is moving in the right direction now "Singh Passing buck onto steer co This has been an extremely painful day - hopefully the TKO happens soon
Jenny Whitewaves,Time spent telling a letter of acceptance Dec 2015 was binding agreement. Now says there was no agreement in June 2016 because the SLA was not signed per Dr Weiss or it may have been signed in Jan Dr Weiss believed the unsigned SLA was inaction Jan 2018 because there was a acceptance letter in place and work was done on that so back dating it was only dating it to the date it was in action Jan 2016
Mangalani Mangalani,@Eleanor Woodman Was it not Accenture? Bushiri lawyer again @Sanjay Maharaj Managers are instructed to work with these fraudsters since Executives have accepted kickbacks.

I am a lawyer. I will take years to reach your standards. "A noj is smart "Zondo fo Chief Justice @Moonchild- professionals don’t do that.

Seleka *one
Benediction Letlhogile,"Mr Seleka should step down. coz the DCJ makes him look soooo incompetent
Mohapi Mokoena,"Msholozi lo wakho Dazana aka Zuma is nothing but a liar

Theo Maluleke,Former Chartered accountant please call in Myburgh but his is south African 
Dilip Badal,just lock up this guy and dispose of the keys @Kevin1 .. on the money
siyabonga mdluli,natural born liar
Apparently Allegedly mokoena,even his SC said the agreement was signed in January
tronix deep,Anoj is Guilty but it's going to be hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt because of the lack of oversight at Eskom. It's easy for him to pin on someone who was not doing their job.
Joyful Technologies,manga.manga bussness. Long stories....?????? "LIE Does Ramaphosa control the price of oil? That was not mentioned in any of his family meetings.

Canis Africanis,"""Let me help you""."
Koena Boity Sherif,Mr sing must be banished from SA
Ntombikayise Gwija,I think ntate Seleka and ntate Zindo are having common understanding together 👏🏽 But their education has been only an embarrassment exposed them to the public 
Magdeline Mabuse,...... .

Lee D. Hendrix,...Albinos are great... ...SAfrica's Constitution has no representing body. ...Singh's asset should have long been/be frozen "...Singh is not capable of following the Constitution's premise ...Many educators are viewing the stupidity across Motherland....No one should be subjected to a Government for outlaws who abuse and then arrest others. "...I will tell you that it's going to rain after the seeds a planted ...A proposition is concluded as a contract by signature of the responsible individual..s. ...Stealing a specific item is not a mistake..... "...There's nothing worse than being required to be obtuse and locked down in shacks without water and electricity "...IF the Government is sued for child neglect and benefits denial "...@Sanjay Maharaj; women give birth after compilation with a male who should have a plan to parent ...Manhood ...Trillion is one person....... ...Yes and No have one meaning each "...It's just that; some people awake to depend on other people to harass with their daft ideologies ..Creating Money out of thin air by lazy loafers subded to minds of illiterates who expected to benefit from the process ..Which African country has the cheapest Presidential Authority for rent or lease? ...Let's see; 1 USD = 14.6 Rand ...Singh is trying to buy Seleka on tv
Waheeda Khan,this is a straightforward case. according to the pfma trillion was not a sub contractor or neither a nominated sub contractor. they got paid directly by singh without a cession by McKenzie. singh is just faffing around.he knows the pfma rules. he should go to c max prison. he has no conscience he has robbed the poorest if the poor of services according to pfma liability is not a prerequisite to pay. if trillion did the work for McKenzie they must pay not singh
