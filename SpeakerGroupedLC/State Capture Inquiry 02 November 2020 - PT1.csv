WHAT?? shes going to cry..... 30% set asside for Meeee whats the pay for a director of SAA technical? had Why do ANC deploy cadres and party members with no business clue in the relevant industries rather than just hiring competent pros and giving them direction? and we not even close to the 4m paid into her account....
Moonchild,"Oh no It's amazing how these implicated individuals all suffer from memory loss & are incredibly angry & defensive - it go figure! "@mvubu1234 - yes DCJ must just close her down now & let's get on with the business of the day! @Heather Durr - 100%!! She's now pulling the emotional card & thinks DCJ will feel sorry for her by crying! She is in sheltered employment & would never be able to get away with this corruption in the private sector. In fact she would never be able to find a job in the private sector! Here we go @Kate! Go for it Including her drunk lawyer 😳? Nooooooooooooooooo!!! This is too much - shut her up now @DCJ!!! Who is she trying to kid that after 26 years of BEE they did not know what it meant or how to implement it?? What absolute BS Only benefits the political elite of the ANC Watch this woman & her lawyer will make this a race thing - inevitable when someone is guilty & a white person leads the evidence. Just a diversion from the truth. This woman & her lawyer are just embarrassing themselves now & are being the laughing stock of SA!

Musa Johannes Sithole,We were being led by stupids all along. She does not understand the role of the Commission. She does not know that she was supposed to help the Commission from the word go. This people do not understand that the Commission is instituted to seek the truth on behalf of us SAns. They keep on saying it's not a court of law. "This is not a political meeting These are the kind of people leading the administration of our SOEs fellow SAns. These are people who supposed to look after our assets.

Who in their right mind would defend corrption and looting? Procedurally unfair behaviour must be called out even if it is against a fixed narrative. @Kerry van Schalkwyk have you sen any other attorney or representative of a witness treated the way Miss Mbanjwa has? even in the slightest at this commision? Even when it is her chance to speak? Arrogance? Now that your Adv hormeyer is leading on the wrong evidence as stated on record...?

Dumile Mateza,It actually remained irregular There seems to have been a personal relationship rather than a professional one. This lady is throwing in Bidvest and Wolf because they were fighting Bidvest as if the contracts were obtained through the back door. Advocate Hofmeyer is on top of her game. These are people who thought they were untouchables She must be careful there coud be a recording The arrogance of this woman is untold Thapelo they were given the documents and they did not read them. The evidence is changing now. This was now Wolf Meyer's meeting. Contratry to what she said in her evidence in chief I think Ms Kwinana is perjuring herself She was sent to that meeting to deal with what they termed green contracts.

a b c,"I agree... that whole ""black people"" comment was distasteful... if you include race it's like you're saying that black people are inferior to other races..." "@Pastor J.J I don't think it matters that she said ""most blacks""... the fact is she shouldn't have brought up race at all don't you think?" @Khani I think it would have been more accurate to have perhaps said corrupt individuals period... rather than also mention their race... I think it would've avoided the issue... "Because by saying ""black people"" it implies a number of things like it's exclusive only to blacks or that the skin colour plays a part in the corruption" @Yolo More 😅😅 Khanyi though you are right... it is no secret that the municipalities (which are run by mostly blacks) are in shambles... but it's about competence and not skin colour... I hope you get me 🙂 @Yolo More gm ol' friend... "Khanyi oh sorry madam @SanFran Arnold hey ey... how you been cousin? gtsy 😃 @Zalisile Ndzala very well said my friend! @Khanyi sure thing... we're on the same side anyway...

Molao Peter,morning everyone
Aubrey De Bliquy,what did I miss this morning? Hey @Khanyi What did I miss this morning? LOL @Cruda Bex read I gues I will have to watch the first half this evening or lunch time if they dont run through lunch. "@Bongumenzi Nxumalo 💯 Race politics is as bankrupt today as it was under the Apartheid regime "Another thing that makes me angry is when people associate corruption with race ❤ Who is this? I missed this morning? thanks Any thoughts on Malema's lawyer? LOL Flannel mouthe fox came to mind. LOL She is really professional and has a firm but friendly demeanor Is this people emulating Zuma economics? WHo taught these dummies corruption? She does not strike me as arrogant. I think she is honest but evasive. She is reacting as if she believes she is corner instead of just answering the questions which is unfortunately a defensive behaviuor which may be misread for guilt. A little ill informed or ignorant rather than arrogant. zip... The world is watching this fine display of a thriving young constitutional democracy functioning under law. Hope the world takes a lesson. This is how a people's government works. @Rene Ngwenya The cup is half full. At least we have an abundance of young black professionals who stand ready to serve their country when we need them as we now surely do. "Zondo is visibly ""gobsmacked"" by what he is hearing. LOL" Was she the chair of SAA getting involved in operational meetings? No wonder Zondo is incredulous. Breathaking incompetence and ignorance. That can only mean the people who appointed her were just as clueless. The blind leading the blind. That is so reckless. How can you risk a national asset like that in incompetent hands? It's criminal incompetence. Is this the basically you were talking about? Zondo is getting impatient and trying to retain his poise.
Elizabeth van Niekerk,or are they on tea thanks Adv Hofmeyer .... calm down ! she does not really remember much does she ...? for the kickbacks involved thats why they got involved she cant look you in the eyes! disrespectful attorneys

Bill West,Sidwell I agree with you this lawyer is wasting time and tax payers money by beating about the Bush and side tracking by not answering questions truthfully and factually why must a witness have a lawyer represent it knowing how lawyers twist and turn if it is not afraid of telling the truth will show its real involvement Brilliant prosecutor Thank you Judge Zondo for cutting to the bone with this witness Rene I agree with you. As stated in another comment the graduation is limited to the university of Ssconwold for these selective memory loss employees "Rob Nel ever hear of the old saying ""baadjies vir noeties (en sussies)?" Beautiful Judge Zonfo. Put this lawyer in her place helping the witness avoid answering relevant questions. Vaccinating and trying to squirm out of honestly answering the question. Sick invompetence Hopefully this witness does not represent the honorable profession of chartered accountants

Kevin Simon,Board members clearly there to ensure the looting instructions are carried out. Very simple model. This lady is on strong medication. Getting worse as time goes on Her support was about ensuring that 30% could be extorted from the contract. Just an exercise in looting. Cyril I hope you are watching.
