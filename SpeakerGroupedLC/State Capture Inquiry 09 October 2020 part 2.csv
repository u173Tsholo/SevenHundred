Hlagala Masetlale,@Rox the clowns supporting Zuma are just crowd for hire and remnants of the Guptas The chair has a photographic memory it will help if Zuma's appearance is virtual to avoid his lawyers's theatrical acts Only the Gupta brothers and RET brigades refers to him as the president. The people of SA3 *Sa no

"Jozi now is dead The new south Africa is scary and very sad Anc will most likely win next election but by a landslide If some of the new oppostion parties can form an alliance and implement policies that benefit all South Africans then ANC can easily be voted out .EFF and DA cannot be trusted! @TD..All of the ANC members are corrupt..You must be crazy to think that some are clean Is he adjourning again..No wonder it is taking forever to conclude @TD..You are living in your own world..As you support the Anc
Maboko S,100GB for that matter🤣🤣🤣 They were just ordering him around Zupta must fall "Delaying tactics have been working for JG If Hlophe take the Chair we are doomed 😀 Let's vote for Zondo anc can't be trusted anymore Well they can rule until jesus come b😀ack only if he's coming back next year 2021

Angelo Doubel,@Russia Magezi for sure. he thinks he is above the law. @ Elvis Malakoane u think so? delay tactics @ Elvis Malakoane okay. we'll just have to wait and see. @Elvis Malakoane where is Mr Zuma getting all this millions for court battles? @ Elvis Malakoane for sure bra @Elvis Malakoane why didn't Zuma go into business like CR17. instead of going for the presidency @fuzile danaza ANC will always be corrupt. they think they more powerful than people of this @Naledi Barron tell him the next election the ANC will get 30% of te vote. @Rox 🤣🤣🤣 @Kopz Koape. we are voting for action SA
