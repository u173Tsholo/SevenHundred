It's easily traceable Kate Hofmeyer just led the witness and the ever useless Miss Mbanjwa is quiet where it matters.

Aubrey De Bliquy,Did her advocate also run away? SABC 2100 Watching and climbing eNCA 200 SABC 3100 eNCA192 sMe too Vetkoek and AMASi @Samke Mtshali Yes SABC is not captured💗 except by the people. Does she know lieing to the commission is a criminal offence? SABC 5146 eNCA 189 It is directed to Miss Hofmeyer but the witness is listening to what you are thinking and being emboldened to lie to her own detriment. YES or NO? tHIS IS HOW A LIAR RESPONDS TO A yes OR no HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION She is fighting against WMC LOL And her legal council is not helping her by allowing her to lie. People don't know hos serious this is. How will she manage being sent to jaol? "Listen to her legal council Her council is obstructing the commission and adversely effecting her client who will not be escused on the basis of her councils incompetence. When she being tried for her lies and corruption she will not be able to use incompetent legal council as an excuse OK it's not just me SOUND LAG VOICE IMAGE SYNCH video lags voice about 1 second She does not understand she is not above the law. There is no way this witness wil not end up in jail. Her testimony is sufficient to indict her. She is not on trial basically @Mukona Mulungisi You would lose the bet. You want to formalize the bet? ? Zondo cannot pass judgement on her but her own words on the record are permissible evidence in court. SABC VIDEO SOUND LAG painful like Adam Schiff talking about the Dmocrats being EXFILTRATED byt the Russians LOL How can anyone wear stupid on their arm like that? She suffers from cognicent dissonant denial does she believe her own lies? It was not irregular because we were talking about regular things. LOL They would know because she is honest as we all can see How much is stupid and pretend stupid? Will she be stripped of her CA by the Chartered institute of secretaries? Thank YOU SABC. Sound synch is back The 11th commandment. DONT GET CAUGHT yup "Everyone is supposed to be on the same team @Salty Crack Your profit will require you win the tender for orange overalls. Yes. I agree. these are the birth pangs of our thriving young democracy. She does no know that her original email will emerge even if she deleted it. losing track of her lies It is a serious crimina offence to lie to the commission. Go figure. her lawyer is making it worse for her. the question is about fact not policy "share to Faceebook and whatsApp and ge the viewers above 10 The Commission has a TENDENCy. LOL Leave her council to sleep. Council is making it worse for her client. except for the wine and dine Rightly angry. Thhis hostile witness is demonstrably teling lies one after the other. @Robert Malan LOL Jujus lawyer will get you off a charge of cannabalism while his clien sits in the passageway linching off a human foot. LOL It's worse than that. not advertising is not an exemption They wont know if I lie to them so its no problem Only brokers must tell the truth. She can lie secretly. Fortunately for her she is not smart enough to know the trouble she is in so she remains calm. having a break they are planning to continue until 6 was it 6th or 16th November? "@Naledi Barron Thanks get a more comfortable chair then 5276 watching. Watch it jump up again in ten minutes SABC live overage of Stae Capture inquiry until 18h00 SABC live coverage of State Capture inquiry until 18h00 And the word BASICALLY is like Adam Schiff's EXFILTRATION by the Russians. The more you say it the more people think you are talking sense. She thinks ignorance of the law is a legitimate defense Her patronizing posture towards the advocate and DCJ is breathtaking. She must think somebody believes her. she is teaching them They are so lucky she is teaching them She still does not know what she is doing is illegal because she does not advertise her services. Every day the of the commission makes the rand stronger Looks like a secret laundering operation for the mob. Perfect cover of stupid. The whole world is lieing and she speaks the truth. State Capturjoin the dots "Maybe her clients were like love this crook horrible if one thinks they are doing exactly waht Mandea feared and warned against. We better get rid of this race $#1t if we gonna actually win collectively. Whites should be welcomed into the ANC en masse to force the freedom Charter to be fulfilled. I am an old man.

Wolfgang Redeker,These board members are always so clever when stealing state money but when they get to Commission suddenly become stupid. Who’s making fat cake today? Someone said earlier Ace was arrested short while ago????? Is it fake news Joh imagine Hlaudi Motsoneng in same SOE as this one and Dudu SABC waiting for tv license fees from Netflix and Apple TV to pay sound guy My thoughts exactly ..... a drone She smoking same stuff as Hlaudi Did the daughter sell the fat cakes at Business class lounge maybe🤔 "Help @abc thanks Nope This chat system not very user friendly🤔 Hoffie is a frikkin Ninja Kwinana is a fat cake Joh Kwinana is human she made a joke I was not wined and dined and I have the Saxon World T shirt to prove it. Hoffie is a Marvel Agent @luna you know where? Asking for a friend. From Fat Cakes to Forex @luna 👍I’m going to Spain soon 😂 "The clever one is Mbabaja @Kwinana same school as Hlaudi @ Tumy Tsele Hlaudi was the bomb “He got invested” in Fat Cakes Hoffie back on the scent What? The server is alive? I think this Commission is excellent at bringing us all together and being able to laugh at our country. We might not have most sophisticated criminals but man are they funny. Servers never die completely This chat has best comedians in the world👍👍👍👍❤️❤️ Somehow SARS not interested in her but rather focusing on poor pensioner claiming medical rebate Ms Kwinana aka “Fat cakes” would be perfect wife for JZ Hoffie off her A game today......usually circles and circles and then kills Lumka also owner of “Fat Cakes” I think aunty “Fat Cakes” has worn down Hoffie Mbabaja is the puppet master Mbabaja wants 14 days set aside to re-examine Fat Cakes

Nothing out there ☹ "The Tea Lady is busy washing the dishes after lunch Her University are going to use this as a training aid video on how not to behave at a commission.

I would trust her with my remote control I think Killer Kate should have her own YouTube channel. I Would rather have been arrested if I was her than show up here at the commission in front of Killer Kate. Maybe she thought her lawyer would object enough to wear Kate and DCJ down. How does she get paid then? At least now she's not umming and aahing and don't know. She knew nothing about being in a meeting where 1 Billion rand is discussed. Yes but you wasted time so now it will be three days. Ms Mbanjwa is laughing at the amount of time this woman will take in fees in court. Why does she know so much about Forex but can't remember 💩 about SAA meetings that she was seen in. "Her lawyer is charging by the hour I wish Kate an 'ACE' on the witness stand. CA means so many things in this woman's context. If I was a CA I would be cringing by now. Glad I am a Doctor. This woman doesn't remember a R5 Million Property that was sold???.

Digital Solv,She makes ANC cadre look awful. Nobody will want this cadre Mrs Hofmeyer is shrewd. She is an outstanding evidence leader. trust at 100% is given in lieue of the tender spoils given to him. quid quo pro. Not visible. Hofmeyer is going to link tender to the force used to give her a kickback. He used this as a hedge mechanism she is going to lose her SAICA licence and go straight to jail for more than 15 yrs. Fraud but also in many areas. SA Chefs. Fabrication is building 'straw man' This dies not exist. It is not a steel man. She is a risk auditor. Whoaaaaa Mrs Hofmeyer is going to link to awarding of tender was used by her to leverage benefits in the form of investment in her Forex biz. Mrs Hofmeyer is just getting her in more trouble as she is going to link the Tender influence she plated to establish a Forex biz that was trading unlawfully. I reckon that we read headlines in this week. She is going to be arrested in this week. From a security view. Why have server in office. It is more secure in the cloud out of office and more cost efficient. Mrs Hofmeyer has a commercial qualification. Not only a lawyer. So playing dumb to get more evidence I reckon her husband can only answer Y or N to any questions. She is bragging her way into a major trap. The link between tender manipulations and her Forex business. Got her. She is running her own company fraudulently with her personal accounts. "SA is not going to work like this anymore FICA docs prove she knew of marriage link. It is reported on FICA.
