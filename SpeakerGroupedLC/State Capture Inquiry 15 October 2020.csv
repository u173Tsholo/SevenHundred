Mzalwane Mzala,Agrizzi was denied bailed for lying to the prosecution and that did not assist with bail application. @mvubu1234 R33M off-shore People hand passports over when they get bail so to hide that you have another passport is very serious. Zuma should have used the information about this tender against General Nyanda instead of making an absurd spy claim. This is not hearsay as there was a disciplinary hearing that captured these things and resulted in a verdict to dismiss. @Heather Durr You're welcome From being a flight attendant Nombasa Ntsondwa-Ndhlovu got over R100M tenders from the SANDF after starting a romantic relationship with a General. Agrizzi is appearing in the bigger Bosasa case tomorrow. Deputy police commissioner Bonang Mgwenya suspended after arrest Political instructions trumped legal advice at Transnet The lawyers' fee should be recouped from those who ignored legal advice that came at huge costs. Minister Barbara Horgan was replaced by Malusi Gigaba to reverse the work that was already done. 2. The board that decided to discipline Gama was dismissed and a new one led by Mr Mkhwanazi was appointed and it immediately worked on bringing Gama back. 3. The new board replaced the legal firm that was succeeding in getting Gama out of Transnet and getting him to pay back Transnet monies. 4. The new law firm was instructed to negotiate a deal with Gama. @Albert Noah The witness is very clear
Thulani Bukani,Agrizzis credit card had more than R4mil positive balance
Vivek Iyer,MK vets should be here Hang them
Pule Mokoena,But house arrest was enough for him
Mr Zitha,"I listened to the former chair of Eskom board giving his testimony and I must say these guys are so clueless When are these crooks going to stand in front of the judge? The Mafia family (ANC) have captured the country and it hurts so bad. Who is transnet CEO now? @SanFran Arnold thanks "I don't like Bowman @Bumpy Johnson I agree "@keeran kerar Do you think the guy mean all those things NPA just like SAPS are failing South Africa.

BanditZA,They just sign minutes without reading them 3 years later They sign minutes which make absolutely no sense HODs then act on those nonsensical minutes and make payments of millions I have always loved the ANC but they make it so so so hard Cadre deployment must end A competent civil service must be built @Brian to be expected he has experience perusing legal documents EFF is not an option. I watched clips of Malema speaking outside court about how police must be treated...it is sad to see him sink so low from the high ideals he preaches @EMANUEL KGAPHOLA Protect from what?
Tumi Sereme,Chair has elephant memory. Madume maAfrica. We do have alternative party am afraid. Morning Jackie "Eish I like Agrizzi. Somethings we know because of him Is Watson not dead? "Haai Des And put who in power Mangete? Strange "I have simple question
Antoinette Meyer,who be mr witness 2 day Thank you Arnold 😊@Arnold are we not hearing a repitition of the earlier testimony?
Brian,Wonderful to have a witness who can promptly find the pages! @ Cruda Bex. Ironical that you should mention poor blacks on a chat group dealing with years of corruption mainly benefitting many of our black leaders?☺ @ Thusanang. Absolutely Zondo can use someone like Todd on his team! @ Guguletho. Probably not but I was just highlighting the calibre of the man @ abc. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 What is Zondo saying please? Poor ole Myburg could have gone on tea a long time ago - no one would even have noticed LOL
Jenny Whitewaves,We need Agrizzi in person in court to testify be cross examined to be able to have solid evidence against those implicated in state capture especially the top thieves I am hope his health improves Without Agrizzi as a witness only his statements and commission appearance The court cases against the big guys and gals will drag on for years complaining that his version could not be challenged @Paul Buchel true that's why we will have lots of delays in the court system Alive @Tumi Sereme some street dweller who matched physical size @vuyani mnqayana Without the commission the theft continuing more than it is No pressure on ANC to at least pretend to want to stop theft. No SIU no cleaned up NPA Just a failed bankrupt state I wonder if the redistribution of land would be such a vote catcher if it was realised that the land to be redistributed is farming land not urban land to live on Not everyone wants to be a farmer @Naledi Barron thanks it is another 1/2 truth like the loss of grants if ANC not in power @Kutlwano Makhobotloane you think that that land that will free it is the land claimed not the improvements standing on it so the land may be free but the improvements will have to be paid for @Sabelo Nxumalo I live in a rural area Most of the mushrooms in your shops are produced by a black farmer I go to do health checks for a huge black owned egg farm plus others in my area only @Sabelo Nxumalo if political parties e.g. The EFF would stop stirring up encouraging and manufacturing racial tensions for their own ends There wouldn't be so much tension There is a lot of encouragement to young black farmers our local agricultural school the students work on farms both black and white farms for experience in different areas no treatment complaints The government has not said a word about the improvements on the land. Will the office blocks houses be paid for or demolished before hand over The land should be returned in the state it was found What about land with a bond on it most of the farm land and urban land will the recipients take over the bonds or part there off? This is just a vote catcher not thought through the difficulties @Tumi Sereme IC agree the greater wrong was done by South Africans however the means the Guptas used were illegal i.e to offer a bribe is illegal To take it and act against your country is treason

a b c,Looks like today's proceedings with this witness will be pretty cut and dry... nothing too exciting other than the chat... "He can remember things well @EMANUEL KGAPHOLA You need qualifications to be an academic... does Malema have any? Malema says things to please the frustrated poor folk and incite them to rage by pointing to convenient groups of people... if he is elected he'll bring chaos... @SanFran Arnold 😁 @Heather Durr Lol 😅😅 @Sam Monkoe Much appreciated cousin! 😅😅 Though i'd probably be too nervous in front of people hahaha Yes @Tshepo Malaka ... an example of an honest testimony this one...

Thank you I also sometimes question the efficacy of the commission... it's starting to cost more than perhaps what was stolen @vuyani mnqayana ... It will have been a huge waste of resources if it doesn't produce results is what I'm saying... "While it's true that the majority of whites in SA are financially stable "@Aubrey De Bliquy While this is true @Sabelo Nxumalo That is actually a misconception... the only way to prove if they took it by injustice is if they cannot provide documents proving a fair sale... "There are however cases of some land taken by force Usually the EFF and ANC tend to exaggerate how much of the land was taken by conquest (unfairly) @Makhosini Zwane Depends on the time period... I'm specifically referring to the time of conquest and colonialism... but later on there were fair sales that were made... not sure exactly which parts "@Sabelo Nxumalo True I think that it it can be proven by documentation then the land should indeed be restored "@Kutlwano Makhobotloane I suppose that's also true @Makhosini Zwane You see that's the issue... remember that government can't just displace thousands of people to a land that is currently being used for food security... but it is complicated... @Kutlwano Makhobotloane Agree 100% "@Kutlwano Makhobotloane Though it must be approached cautiously to not repeat history (Ukraine "@Sabelo Nxumalo Yeah @Kutlwano Makhobotloane Indeed... and remember that we're in a generation where adults have grown in urban areas and know very little about land management or even farming... that's another issue "@Sabelo Nxumalo According to some "That's why I agree that whites did do very unjust things regarding the land in the past @joyce tendai Zvavareyi hahaha "@Sabelo Nxumalo Some can @Sabelo Nxumalo *some can be proven @Kutlwano Makhobotloane LOL wanted all of what... the land? (Didn't quite catch what you mean) Nah let's not pretend... we all know full well that boers are NOT willing to co-own the land with blacks... that is just a fact guys... @Kutlwano Makhobotloane Oh lol no! 😅😅😅 "That's why I said that it's a complicated situation involving different cultures and years of assimilation force @Kutlwano Makhobotloane That is actually very true... people forget that some black also die during farm attacks... but all in all those farm attacks are deplorable and must be stopped @Kutlwano Makhobotloane Indeed One fact that remains is that SA is still one of the world's most unequal economic nations... if you do the research you'll find that about 1% of the population owns 90% of the countries wealth... @Mzalwane Mzala Exactly "Exactly... every country has its history @MIKE DURBAN @SanFran Arnold Lol hahaha... I don't think that man will ever rest in peace @Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Indeed! The problem is when the higher-ups find loopholes to escape justice... it's a strange system... @MIKE DURBAN Oh sorry...

Annie Van Niekerk,Hi all. When are they returning?
Lonwabo Mbana,@vuyani mnqayana R700M vs value of uncovered corruption. Voting out ANC will not solve corruption. Someone has to report gaps and recommend methods to closing to gaps in governance.
SD Gudunkomo,So far white accomplices on corruptions has showed that when they get caught they confess the truth as part of taking responsibility.how come its difficult for whites to accept that land issues has to be rectified.how come its difficult to agreeing on the fact that it's not fair for them to swim in wealth when the majority suffers.🤔 lance but they are the beneficiaries of the crime a b c but they owned the land that was taken through injustices to its owners What is the point in recovering what is lost through crime if that doesn't apply when it comes to land.why land issue is treated differently from this? a b c apartheid passed laws that enabled it to take land without paying it from its owners and that was declared as crime against humanity.as it was part of apartheid system nah I blame our government and De Klerk and all those who supports these injustices happened to the black community as they agreed to embrace crime by denying black community rights to economy (land) Naledi they are all white😊 a b c in fact all the land that was taken through land act of 1913 Jenny we want to be farmers.are our white farmers prepared to work with blacks as co owners of land? Naledi if white agree to co own the land with blacks and be allowed to participate in the economy within their areas when the farm lands are.there won't be this animosity between whites and blacks Jenny how is the relationship between black farmers and white farmers? "Naledi that is true.some people they don't even want to own the land Jenny EFF is reacting to what is already happening.honestly harmony in this country is denied by those who got wealth. Kutlwano I agree with u Paul but you were favoured by the system while others were not given a chance to climb that ladder. Paul you see while I was at high school I dreamt of being a farmer but unfortunately life drove me to do something I never dreamt of. "Did you know that when a white man decide to put his business in rural area accept the person as one of their own. Tommygun one before start a business do some research Naledi I'm glad that you know what m talking about
