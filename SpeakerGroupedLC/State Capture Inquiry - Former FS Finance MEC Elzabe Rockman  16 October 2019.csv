Lucky Benya,As we wait "This is just a talk shop "It's either the memory is still buffering or she's playing safe
Derrick saperstein,"With cost of this inquiry ON TIME !!! WOW !!! "Wow
clive oconnell,Zuma plot of load shedding stopping you soon
Phillip Cwazibe,@Derrick saperstein ‚Äã With cost of this inquiry. Same but I am hping that the state will recover more than the cost.
Ben Cole,No talk shop. It casts sunlight on darkness where there was none. It prods our consciences to make better choices in future. It will in time lead to prosecutions. "@I am free
Murugasen Ganesh,what new your name
Derek Main,I think this commission should run permanently to name and shame all the corrupt cadres. @Zama Kubheka State capture and corruption will never stop as long as the ANC is on power. They are corrupt to the core. I don't think Ramaphosa's strategy of telling everyone what they want to hear is fooling anyone anymore. @I Am Free Those were pledges and they often don't materialise. "@I Am Free You may be right but I still think it's a semantics game he was playing. He said ""secured"" but that could still mean just a pledge." @Lady Bird You and me both. @Kapn Krunch The bible stories are about as credible as flesh eating reptiles. @Lady Bird The problem we have in SA is the ANC. Get them out of power and maybe we stand a chance of recovering (if it's not too late). @I Am Free EFF are small fry - they just make a lot of noise. @Robert Russell Yes - everybody knew it except the EFF supporters. They still can't see how their leadership is just as corrupt as the ANC. @I Am Free The EFF's recent popularity tells me that their message resonates with many fellow SAfns and I think these issues need to be debated and addressed. @I Am Free Ignoring these issues will just allow more hyenas to take advantage. @Sven 008 You're preaching to the converted. Trump is KKK Trump is mentally unstable - the very last person who should be in charge of nuclear weapons. @I Am Free Trump is the US's Zuma. "@Easy D ""Better the devil you know"" - That's what the ANC supporters said about Zuma." "Soon Trump is going to hear the words: ""You're fired!"" üòÅ" Load shedding! Eish! Thanks for that all you ANC voters. @Easy D We can only hope. "@nonhlanhla ntombela Seems to be the ANC strategy - if everyone doesn't have it "@nonhlanhla ntombela So instead of striving for everyone having something @nonhlanhla ntombela Your share of nothing is still nothing. ok "@nonhlanhla ntombela While I'm all for addressing the inequality issues we have "@nonhlanhla ntombela And until you realise that your ANC leaders are only interested in their own pockets "@nonhlanhla ntombela If you keep telling me that because of my skin colour "@nonhlanhla ntombela I believe that we have an inequality problem - no matter what colour the rich happen to be. If we address it in that way "@nonhlanhla ntombela If you address it from a racist standpoint @Teboho Skofifi I like to see some proof of that before I believe it. @nonhlanhla ntombela That some race groups were advantaged is common cause - that was the essence of apartheid afterall. I think many white SAfns wanted to address all the ills... "@nonhlanhla ntombela ...but because they are now demonised "@nonhlanhla ntombela You can't tell people that they are not wanted @Thulani Bukani I'm saying there was a time when that was true - I don't think it is anymore. @Thulani Bukani Believe what you like - whatever I say won't change your view anyway. @Tebogo Makoro And the ANC intends correcting that by implementing Apartheid Ver 2.0 @Thulani Bukani It's attitudes like yours that cause more division - you must be ANC. You do realise that you are racist - the NP would be proud of you. @Teboho Skofifi What info? @Jabu Malinga I have never denied that. Are you prepared to admit that what we have now discriminates unfairly against whites?
Zama Kubheka,There are so many people who have not come forward yet. I feel like this is dragging!!! when is state capture gonna finish?
Lady Bird,You must ask how much of those investments went into Ramaphosa's pocket... Derek I hope that those pledges are incumbent on action on corruption Is there not a clause in law where NO GOV OFFICIAL OR THEIR FAMILY should NOT benefit from gov. financially ? I mean come on There should be no way Gov .officials and their families that benefit from gov. grants and contracts LOL Wow Robert Russell that is highly concerning Sounds like people with no qualifications Rob ... Yes FREE I am from RSA ...living in Israel "Iam not Jewish  LOL NP I Am Free funny Icelanders dont think they are going extinct and there are only a few hundred thousand of them in the world lol Last time SAA was run with a profit a Coloured Cheryl Carolus was in charge ...Last time gov ran a solvent budget with a surplus a Coloured was in charge Trevor Manual ....I see a trend here .

LOL Derek You will NOT get your money back if you keep the ANC in power Sindiswa Moolman In Fact you will keep losing your money Who is that Sindiswa ?

The New Age was pre negotiated with the FS by Ace @cupido jaftha ...Taxpayers
Samoldemus,i decline. the fall of america private public property i decline
Mzobanzi Dazela,Remember when Alexander riots were staged only for free ANC campaign program in the cry for help. Ramaphosa hasn't done any of the promises he promised those people. Very unfair.
Thami Ngwenya,BA languages on finance position "Depends Baningi abafundile but ignored ngoba bangama clever blacks But Jacob is a politician not an official
Norman Zwane,@Thami Ngwenya Is that significant if she had 15yrs experience in the general area of governance? "@Thami Ngwenya I see your point. I would suggest she understood the situation quite well but deliberately cooked the books @Pitso Mosetlhe That is so disgusting Pitso. The Free State lost historical prints? "@Lady Bird She is here for evidence I think "@Pitso Mosetlhe Hardy bra "@Lady Bird In that case "@JoziTube Maybe Jub-Jub should anchor it and be sold to Channel 157 ""Moja Love""...just asking?" @Pitso Mosetlhe was there no daily in the Free State as she claims? @Robert Russell We stocked this New Age rubbish and for 2 years we never sold 1 copy. I dont even recall our local fish & chips wrapping chips with it it was so bad. @GH MG Some of us say Febluwali.. each to his own @GH MG Born a Zulu with a lack of 'r' in my alphabet...quite a few clicks though Nonsense but Piet Rampedi did in Limpompo "@thando cezula The more I observe Trump Trump=American Bully Trompie=Afrikaner Bully. Two sides of the same coin Well Lady Bird said so. So what is the IF about?
Robert Russell,Did you know that all senior mangers of SOE must be cleared by the SSA...case in point Eskom has 121 such mangers..100 of them have revused to be vetted. The SOE have discretion to over look red flags Stoned people in glass houses....... The SON newspaper is the worst..... fullstop @I Am Free Have you noticed how quite the EFF have become after the VBS revelations of leadership theft of funds @Derek Main

Corl√© Jansen,who is this lady? shot
Pheladi Lamola,Nobody ever remembers which Gupta brother was present. Why? But they let them call the shots Is that so Sindiswa? Yhoo. They were very sly foxes those Guptas But this could've been discussed with everyone at the same time. Why did they need to meet HER 1st before the Exco? So you decided to be the capital for Guptas. We all know how Guptas never used their own money to pay for anything Yes DCJ. They fled Yes Thando Makes no sense at all judge.
Pieter,Finance MEC Elzabee Rockman
Sindiswa Moolman,They confused people for a reason @Pheladi Lamola. They never introduced themselves to anyone... so I heard. That‚Äôs body shaming @I Am Free The whatabouting is not helping now @JoziTube. Money left our purse during the Zuma time. And we want our money back I‚Äôm banking my money on Bathohi @Lady Bird. The NDPP @Lady Bird Who was reading the New Age papers? Who were their target readers? @Academic Editors you speaking my language. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not that easy Some were forced to and had no option= blacks and some did so because they knew it was wrong and had a option not to=whites @Lady Bird. So this MEC was a Gupta appointee Former MEC...

David Icke tells half truths and imaginary stories Guptas were introduced to zuma by Mbeki who inherited them from Mandela.... why is the focus only on zuma how did we come to bible stories? oh just clicked David Icke theories.....That dude will.make people nuts so @Sindiswa money did not leave during other peoples terms or it is not exposed? just asking because i dont believe corruption came with Zuma but the focus is on 1 Man why do we need government?
FIXAFRIK,watching from Shanghai hahah WONDERS has ended
Kapn Krunch,the commission must conclude before proper prosecutions will start this is not a court of law its leading up to court cases and prosecutions hopefully how cool is it that the united states has frozen gupta assets and businesses in america david icke believes the royal family are flesh eating reptiles i mean do me a favour utter nonsense the nephalim in the bible were giants not reptiles yes and nephalim are the result of cross breeding between angels and women read the book bud thats your opinion

Thulani Bukani,Zuma said this week he is selling his socks for money. Z Gumede last week said she's poorer than a church mouse. what an insult to the poverty stricken black south Africans. @Derick Main did you say many white south Africans want to address the ills of Apartheid? That's the funniest thing I've heard in my life. I dont believe there was ever a time where whites would compromise their comfort and privilege in an attempt to fix the situation of the blacks. @Derek Main @Paul Buchel if your family hated the NP what did they do to show that? do you have a pic of your grand pa marching against Apartheid? @I Am Free are you comparing the effects of BEE to the effects of Apartheid? I'm sure you're not my friend. You not answering my question @Paul Buchel "@Paul Buchel there was none from the white community. my assumption less than 10% of the South African white population. We're willing to put the jobs
Teboho Vincent Lerooibaki,The Guptas only sin is to enter and disrupt the WMC turf and nothing else. OVER 70% of all government tenders are in the hands of WMC especiali multi million and billion rands of value. @ Derek Main all info is available at National and provincial tenders databases. @Derek Main info about companies who received tenders worth millions and billions of rands. Some of these companies have African names but the directors and shareholding is lilly white.
