Popcorn 🍿 out
Maria Raboshakga,This evidence leader though....
Angelo Galasso,. " . . " k

Handsome dube,"chair said if he is well 
watson mutanga,The chair makes some of these advocates nervous. He comes across as being a bit agitated at times. "I remember him humiliating a female witness some months back. The witness had nothing significant to contribute. The chair bluntly dismissed her and tell her in private.
Maggie Render,possibly in 2mins
Kevin Simon,There was a delay to 10 am requested to sort out documents. The FM coding is playing havoc with there keeping to the statements. Needed to sort out some areas in the docs. "Their "Eliot Chauke ​Batohi is in payroll of CR17. Prove it Penny. Is it people as in the plural or not?
Mbuso Ndlovu,Hello news lovers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💪💪💪💪💪 AMANDLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hendrix jeranyama,morning guys "no one will get arrested "Mamellom Mpelo  "remember guys i think hlaudi was being honest but one think he did not realise is that his logic is stupid "Blaze 613  "i think we now need a comission of inquiry regarding the about of tea bags used africa is the motherload of all problems
Zs H.H.,now it seems they placed a microphone in the corridor and the actual speakers voices are distorted.. you mean to say the state cannot get this right?
Dan Brown,It's feedback from the Microphone picking up it's own signal through the remote Microphone on Naidoos end. Not much you can do. I am surprised SABC got that even close as they can't use a Mixer. Headphones on Naidoo's end should cure it though.
TheC4RB1N3,This is bad😕 They say Gavin Watson was already dead before he had the accident? Strange
makhosi nobhatyi,Judge Zondo is struggling with flu True @ Rudi H Kumele abantu bafunde ngoku bangasetyenziswa ngamasele to be supported when they appeared in court they are using poor people which they were not there when they eat these money @ Zintle ndzwangu 😂😂😂😃😃 I can’t wait to see these thugs going to jail babulewe abantu ngenxa yokuma enyanisweni bagxothwa abantu @ Sindiswa Moolman "@Jack Sparrow it a shame and insult to us as poor people "These people pretend as if they know our struggle but they are looking for their stomachs "I am so glad now everybody knows why there no prosecution for Guptas I can’t wait she promised us that they are not yet in a hurry to charge and arrest until they have full evidence collected so that there will be no more postponement because not enough evidence
zintle ndzwangu,I think I have heard enough. People need to be held accountable now! Tjo! Yey idliwe imali eSATAFRIKA andinamona lol @Sindiswa Moolman Im shook @makhosi nobhatyi @Sindiswa Moolman Uba niyawazi ama tutu. Yey Ngamasela aba bantu lol Is Mdluli still in CI? @Gee Peex1 Hello It was all fun and games when Agrizzi and Hlaudi were testifying and singing. This right here is a lot to stomach hey. @Immanuel So now is the right time ne hahahahah Can they just give us these peoples real names... I wan to see something. @Born free Gangsters of note! This should be a lesson to those who are still looting.. Nothing stays hidden forever. I was never ready for Mr Naidoos testimony!😕 SA needs a shutdown. Ayikho alok le @Sindiswa Moolman But they did name some of them who benefited from all this criminality. What is so special about these FM gangsters? @threedeespace I dont see it happening. Is Agrizzi still out on bail? @Eliot Chauke Point on! @Sindiswa Moolman I get you @Bulali Rawana Uphesheya @threedeespace Dead and buried. @threedeespace Lol The family is not saying a thing except for that they know who killed him. He was already dead before the crash. Nomvula Makonyana promised to spill the beans soon tho LOL Ngathi akalalanga tu lomlungu. Uyaphithizela nje ay DCJ is losing weight also.. How long is tea break? @Immanuel Hahahahahhahaha Nindibize xabebuya kwi tea @Musa Mbhele Lol enkosi. Sendilapha nam @Bronx Wavy My sentiments exactly Whats this R500-5Mil yall talking about? Im so lost now
Kay Kay,"It means if anything happen to Zondo this inquiry will be on hold? of all the inquiries this one was suppose to be given a panel of judges to help Will all these fm's also come and present their side of the story? Zondo cautioning the guy not to lie "Naidoo should never come out of the witness protection program Is Karima and Rajeni friends or former colleagues or something like that? It will be money making season for lawyers after this inquiry... I predict a protracted period of litigation and counter litigation. witness not clear here Crucial witness but weak or poor evidence leader false intelligence that's a strong statement** shuuuu! inflated from 500 to 5 million that's crazy man being an informant is real business in Mzansi hey "@Redriger Is Batohi going to reinstate the Mdluli murder case buried by Jiba&Mrwebi or not? Is Mdluli still in his position to date? I smell tax evasion on the part of Mdluli... maybe Sars need to ready I think Does General Mdluli still work in the intelligence service? "@Redriger@Rudi
PETER STAFFEN,zintle ndzwangu dream on this is a smoke screen to the world that are trying to come clean "threedeespace it wont happen look at Esidemeni still walking free  Eliot Chauke well said

Ms Cee,"@Immanuel  "@Kay Kay I so wish they could be called  "I miss Ms Gcabashe  I told you @ Immanuel 🤣🤣🤣
Sindiswa Moolman,It’s so sad @zintle ndzwangu. He is quoting what was said @Immanuel Ngamasele namasela @makhosi nobhatyi. I agree. "I think the FMs have been notified. The radio stations are for the public only. So Say it again @makhosi nobhatyi I think all these FMs are implicated individuals who can’t be named by a faceless individual. I think it’s a legal requirement...my take. They were both very vocal against Mbeki and were big supporters of Zuma @Kay Kay. Not sure their relationship standing now. "On Ranjeni
Anne M.,He was repeating what someone said to him @Immanuel @João Souza This is a South African live stream Usually 20 minutes

Nelson Tshwale,black leaders with looting 😖😖😖😖

Eliot Chauke,"Whats so special about these FM01-FM45... if Cele can be named @Mmola EFF Top 6 Batohi is in payroll of CR17 CR17 leaks are out there...

Dan Bourne Yeshurun,liberation movements are not meant to govern... I'm laughing at Ranjeni... Karima is next bicycle donated by Steinhoff Karima can't find a BOSASA story if it fell in her curry I'm wondering what Batohi is waiting for... not enough evidence for esidemeni... shameful Batohi has done nothing but keep her seat warm thus far S.A. NEEDS A BLEACH WAS OF ALL governing personell bleach wash "no even the journalists are toying with the public his identify is sensitive to crime intelligence future and current operations @ mamellom Watson is in Miami getting tipsy at Wet Wilie's send the scorpions to find Watson there will be no arrests... Mdluli was the sacrifice long ago inquiries are the new courts "when Zuma comes back inquiries find the light if day LONG before any prosecution does of* day the school appealed for funds long before the. Michael Komape tragedy if you paid attention you will see that 90 percent of Hlaudi testimony has hurt himself everyday.. paid by VBS ghost accounts then placed in a handbag delivered by ranjeni what ever happened to Maleka???? Batohi is finishing her cornflakes shamila is useless. just keeping her seat warm while ppl are fleeing and being assassinated Immanuel don't start that madness because the majority is black nothing apologetic about black majority in black continent BMC is ANC and nothing else💯 BMC=ANC ANC=BMC born free lets be reasonable... people had to come from diff corners to do ask thus land confusion now. it's global all* this* LAND WAS FREE ALL OVER THE WORLD when indigenous had it. then the disease came with conquerors Jean thank you for the tribal info. it was between iindigenous inhabitants no Musi must now go and lead VF+ jean you simply created another class that wasn't there before. only difference is now you think you can claim LAND. this CUCKOLD has been happening since the boat landed DA are zionists jean I made that comment with respect and matter of fact Eliot if jean is white then his children are white despite appearance there was a backup plan against corrupt officials... its called the US 2nd Amendment bang bang The way on TV SAPS hold shotguns and coffee at the same time same way they used a Kenyan nobody knows named Obama to fight for Zionism and satanism I heard of this new Chinese American candidate. he wants to give all Americans 1k a month for life I didn't bring it up. I responded yes indeed and don't single me out Wild Ricus they are distractions from the real endgame tired of sabc bias Shamila is team Cyril. where is all this blind faith coming from? that's a fact Jean crime intelligence relates to state capture in a way that officials can use Intel to intercept bad reports on officials or they can use Save Face tactics from intel every major election from now will be c governance.. but that truley is the answer @red that too co* governance "Gee Musi doesn't want to fight crime I've noticed that
mrp,lol...

Mokwatlo Oupa,yeses it's a lot R 50 K.
Pheladi Lamola,My take on the FMs is that they're like undercover cops/agents. Their identity is better off hidden so as not to jeopardise their positions. 🤷‍♀️ So this guy has been in witness protection for the past 8 years? When are the people he's running from donning their orange overalls? Where do we start Jennifer? Risky business this. What if Mr Marks had died before he could pay the excess?
