"but you're not answering the question "@Stronger together come be clear and crisp @Stronger together i have requested to join "@Stronger together i found it
Paul Bafana Makhene,SABC has too much ads Going back to enca
Jeanett Machaba,I miss a lot I just open now
Noah Kids,Ms Memela looks tired
Sherwin Peters,fidigetting she just told the DCJ she wasn't at the meeting L I A R defeated The Hoff is a pitbull will there be loadshedding on Valentine's Day eve during the SONA? candlelight date @person the paging eish the witness ain't smiling anymore crisp answers so have u forgiven the Gupta's for stealing our money@JZ? we have have fun pretending he is the real JZ imagine this chat when the real JZ comes back to the commission it Will break the internet @Stronger
SS Mbana,I like Ms Memela's answering style of the questions LOL AZ ZZM noticed that sexy look as well why is Memela getting stuck as to how to answer some questions?
Dominic Przybylski,Seems that Lufthansa and Air France were illicitly blocked from winning the tender so that JM/ARR could get it. @Alex Mlangeni Tenders are essential. It's the people who don't keep to the rules which are the problem. BEE partners also mean that we have to pay more than we would have to without BEE. BEE means that everybody (including the poor) have to pay for a small elite to become super-rich. What is happening with Dudu's civil court trial with OUTA? You may think differently. "The problem with communism is that it considers economics to be zero sum i.e. for some people to get rich other people must get poorer. Capitalism @Derek Main Basic economics - please read up on 'comparative advantage' then get back to me. "@Derek Main relying on ""trickle-down"" assumes the people who supposedly benefit from economic success have no innitiative and are somehow excluded from doing anything to help themselves." "As long as we have a culture which denies the individual and assumes us all to be cows in a herd of cattle "@Derek Main I'm not a 1% or a 99%. I don't identify myself by race "@Derek Main I look after my own conscience. I'd prefer everyone else to look after their own. If they can't they are likely to end up in court "We are all equal in so far as the amount of time we have to enjoy life @Derek Main I live very happily on R3500 per month. There are people who think that's too much and call me a privileged white. I'm not going to let them affect my happiness. I rule myself. If anybody else thinks they rule me that's their problem. @Derek Main I own my own house. I pay R2000 per month for internet access and municipal tax. The rest goes on my other expenses. @Derek Main Heh! I may be in some 1% but not the 1% you're talking about. @Chosen One Many things affect me and I respond to them when I need to. I'm not going to expect a politician to solve my problems when R30/$. The only person I can rely on is myself. "@Dirk vd Westhuyzen I ride a bicycle @Person of interest True. I'll have to start growing vegetables in pot plants. I've met many people in my lifetime and lived in many situations and the poorest people I've met are usually the happiest. When have you seen Bill Gates laugh and sing in happiness? @David Tuer Okay you got me there. I didn't watch. I prefer to watch the women play. I didn't invent the wheel and I'm white. Does that make me inferior? I'm rich in time. "I don't have to spend my time worrying about taxes BEE and associated corruption has cost our country +-R500 billion. That is money that could have been spent on uplifting the poor. Instead it has all gone to a few cadres of the ruling party. "@Noxolo Tshabangu The big auditing firms @Noxolo Tshabangu seems to be as obsessed by race as Hendrik Verwoed was. DA keep on increasing taxes way above rate of inflation. They are more succesful at expropriation without compensation than ANC or EFF. @Anne M. Eh? Is Magashule scheduled to testified? If yes then when? I like her outfit. Our frustration is that this should be in a proper court if the Hawks were competent. Standby letter of credit cannot be used to buy house in Bedfordview.

You can cut it with a knife @David Tuer I think a mixture. @David Tuer there are people at the extreme ends. @David Tuer I like the idea of We The People having power in every decision the state makes. Human Person? @Derek Main the basic question is how can you allocate resources fairly in a society like this? @Dominic Przybylski its an illusion. @Dominic Przybylski what happens when the rand falls to R30/$? @Dominic Przybylski do you think that won't affect you? @Dirk vd Westhuyzen my point exactly. @Dominic Przybylski says he rules himself. @Dirk vd Westhuyzen that will surely affect everyone.

"No Immanuel They (saart) invented a spurious reason for disqualifying Lufthansa. @Mtokozisi Baleni - Too true. CR needs to form a task force to focus on bring corrupt employees (and Directors) to book. @Mtokozisi Baleni - That's a scary thought. "You can talk about Capitalism and Communism and any other ism but what we need are politicians who are patriotic @Dominic Przybylski @Derek Main - To have a conscience you need a belief of what is right and what is wrong. Simple Hey? @Derek Main - So we are always going to be ruled by psychopaths and we may as well accept the status quo? I'm afraid Dom & Derek are now fighting about who is the poorer. You were luckyüòÇ Parents? in our street we only had one each. @Dominic Przybylski - When he was trying to play tennis the other day.

Colleen Arezio,Guys this woman is not dumb. Shes actually rather smart. She doesn't answer direct question where she's involved but give examples. "I make a correction. She is dumb "Pastor J
Derek Main,@Colleen Arezio That may be so but I think the Chair is smarter and sees through her BS. @Mashao Mohale That makes her look guilty. @Dirk vd Westhuyzen Camila - Charles' wife. @Dirk vd Westhuyzen That's the one. @Hans Gunter There's one set of rules for them and a different set of rules for us. We must just pay and shut up. @David Tuer Yes - they had already lined up JK/AAR and needed excuses to drop the other bidders. @Mtokozisi Baleni That would mean voting the ANC out at the next election. It's the only way. @Gareth Hellyar Tehre were 40+ parties contesting the last election - take your pick. @Noxolo Tshabangu The BEE we have at the moment is not redressing anything - just making a few corrupt individuals very rich. @Gareth Hellyar That's a defeatist attitude. @Mtokozisi Baleni Careful what you wish for - you might get it. @Dirk vd Westhuyzen So let me get this straight - we'll keep on voting for a party that been proven to be corrupt to the core because they are a big party? Ridiculous. @Noxolo Tshabangu Yes of course - corruption knows no colour. @Dominic Przybylski What - the trickle-down effect. What a joke. "@Noxolo Tshabangu Not in principle - in fact @Dominic Przybylski The corruption we see in BEE is symptomatic of the greed of capitalism. @Dominic Przybylski Let's be very clear - the 1% have got it wrapped up. The odds are stacked against anyone else. @Noxolo Tshabangu We fix it. Harsh penalties for any transgressors. Nail down the rules so people like Memela can't BS that there are grey zones. @Dominic Przybylski I think we'd do a lot better if we got rid of politicians. They are more trouble than they're worth. @Dominic Przybylski I'm looking after myself but I also have a conscience and can't stand the injustice. "@Dominic Przybylski I say that if the wealthy can't grow a conscience @Dominic Przybylski Since when are the 1% governed by the same rules as us? They will never see the inside of a courtroom no matter what crimes they commit. @David Tuer Our society rewards psychopaths. So the very wealthy have those traits ie. no conscience and litlle idea of wrong and right. @Dominic Przybylski Then by extension I assume you don't worry about people that are extremely poor either. @Dominic Przybylski I put it to you that that is impossible unless you are privileged (eg. you have paid for accommodation etc). @David Tuer Not me - I'm not Dominic. I'm going to shout about it until the cows come home. I think society needs a reset - our values are all wrong. Psychopaths rule and that's got to change. @Chosen One I don't have all the answers but I do feel we could do a better job and we should be talking about how. @Chosen One The current inequality is not sustainable and leads to resentment and eventually violence. "@Person of interest See that's where Dominic and I differ - I may be sitting pretty but if others aren't @Pastor J Thanks Pastor. I also like reading Dominic's posts and often agree but we definitely differ on he capitalism issue. "@David Tuer üòÇ ""That's nothing - when I was young we lived in a cardboard box.""" @David Tuer ü§£

Time must be used to its fullest I maintained yesterday that Adv Hoffmeyr (as thorough as she is) is selectively reading parts of unrelated testimony in order to create a mosaic but all pieces will not fit Mr Kenny why would he asked HOD of Procurement ? this is just crazy Am not questioning the integrity of Adv Hoffmeyr just raising a fundamental point........ @Person of interest Chair is giving to much leeway time has been exhausted. Why is the commission bothering itself with reviewing the contracts "Nah @Anne M. we havent heard any evidence to push the agenda of bribery "@Anne M. @Pastor J @Michael Wild guys can I please ask. Since you guys are insisting that Nontsasa was not given R2.5 m house for no reason "@Norman Zwane brother @Pastor J Apologies for adding you to the previous message @Pastor J thanks brotherman............ LOL the limited anger over CR R1bil is amazing Adv Memela must deal with why she said Finance must pay security deposit LOL @Gareth Hellyar brother I think if the witness is explaining and dealing with issues we must listen carefully and allow ourselves to take the explanantion "LOL @Mbuso Ndlovu you are giving me too much credit brother LOL I would be a desktop editor is a position avails itself @Mbuso Ndlovu Am not evaluating credibility am not skilled to determine credibility........... All am saying is her evidence has been consistent and once she sticks to that her attorney will argue credibility But Ms Mbanjwa must relax will get her chance
