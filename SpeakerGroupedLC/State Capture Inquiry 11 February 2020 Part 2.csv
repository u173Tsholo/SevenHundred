Paul Bafana Makhene,SABC has too much ads Going back to enca
Jeanett Machaba,I miss a lot I just open now
Noah Kids,Ms Memela looks tired

SS Mbana,I like Ms Memela's answering style of the questions LOL AZ ZZM noticed that sexy look as well why is Memela getting stuck as to how to answer some questions?
Dominic Przybylski,Seems that Lufthansa and Air France were illicitly blocked from winning the tender so that JM/ARR could get it. @Alex Mlangeni Tenders are essential. It's the people who don't keep to the rules which are the problem. BEE partners also mean that we have to pay more than we would have to without BEE. BEE means that everybody (including the poor) have to pay for a small elite to become super-rich. What is happening with Dudu's civil court trial with OUTA? You may think differently. "The problem with communism is that it considers economics to be zero sum i.e. for some people to get rich other people must get poorer. Capitalism @Derek Main Basic economics - please read up on 'comparative advantage' then get back to me. "@Derek Main relying on ""trickle-down"" assumes the people who supposedly benefit from economic success have no innitiative and are somehow excluded from doing anything to help themselves." "As long as we have a culture which denies the individual and assumes us all to be cows in a herd of cattle "@Derek Main I'm not a 1% or a 99%. I don't identify myself by race "@Derek Main I look after my own conscience. I'd prefer everyone else to look after their own. If they can't they are likely to end up in court "We are all equal in so far as the amount of time we have to enjoy life @Derek Main I live very happily on R3500 per month. There are people who think that's too much and call me a privileged white. I'm not going to let them affect my happiness. I rule myself. If anybody else thinks they rule me that's their problem. @Derek Main I own my own house. I pay R2000 per month for internet access and municipal tax. The rest goes on my other expenses. @Derek Main Heh! I may be in some 1% but not the 1% you're talking about. @Chosen One Many things affect me and I respond to them when I need to. I'm not going to expect a politician to solve my problems when R30/$. The only person I can rely on is myself. "@Dirk vd Westhuyzen I ride a bicycle @Person of interest True. I'll have to start growing vegetables in pot plants. I've met many people in my lifetime and lived in many situations and the poorest people I've met are usually the happiest. When have you seen Bill Gates laugh and sing in happiness? @David Tuer Okay you got me there. I didn't watch. I prefer to watch the women play. I didn't invent the wheel and I'm white. Does that make me inferior? I'm rich in time. "I don't have to spend my time worrying about taxes BEE and associated corruption has cost our country +-R500 billion. That is money that could have been spent on uplifting the poor. Instead it has all gone to a few cadres of the ruling party. "@Noxolo Tshabangu The big auditing firms @Noxolo Tshabangu seems to be as obsessed by race as Hendrik Verwoed was. DA keep on increasing taxes way above rate of inflation. They are more succesful at expropriation without compensation than ANC or EFF. @Anne M. Eh? Is Magashule scheduled to testified? If yes then when? I like her outfit. Our frustration is that this should be in a proper court if the Hawks were competent. Standby letter of credit cannot be used to buy house in Bedfordview.

Nindi please use respect here Mandisi that is the whole reason. who approved it and why. and why did others not take part in the approval and does that link the donation to her mother of 2.5 million. they all link the dots. mandisi as a consultant on subject of BEE and broad based black economics you should know something is not right here. companies dont give 2.5 million to someone they only met in a conference room. please focus on subject. Trump chat is on another platform. and you will be send there bring CR here and we will ask. for now we on the subject of SAAT let's stay here. when CR is on that stage we will ask him now we focused on SAAT and what the HOD signed and agreed too. bomb yes but you now what I meant. it's in the contract Judge Zonda will silent her now. it's a contract. read it while you sitting. please finish sound off

"@Michael Wild wild and clean @Lex Luger LOL back to ya It's supposed to be a slum dunk. There is tension between Ms Hofmeyr and Ms Memela. You can cut it with a knife @David Tuer I think a mixture. @David Tuer there are people at the extreme ends. @David Tuer I like the idea of We The People having power in every decision the state makes. Human Person? @Derek Main the basic question is how can you allocate resources fairly in a society like this? @Dominic Przybylski its an illusion. @Dominic Przybylski what happens when the rand falls to R30/$? @Dominic Przybylski do you think that won't affect you? @Dirk vd Westhuyzen my point exactly. @Dominic Przybylski says he rules himself. @Dirk vd Westhuyzen that will surely affect everyone. Scrupulously fancy Ms Hofmeyr @FieliesSA I agree. Public Protector material.

Bernard Matolino,"Ohh no folks @Jabu Malinga Hayibo!!! @Bunon Solomon Apparently Adv Maleka was implicated in direct ways by this commission and had to step down. It involved his brother or something @Bunon Solomon Others say he clashed with the DCJ @Pastor J Very warm greetings to you my dearest Mfundisi. Always loved dearly this side. Is the DCJ entertained by this witness @Chosen One LOLEST!!!! "dcj IS LENIENT WITH THIS WITNESS "@AZ ZMM You see that as well "@SS Mbana It's flirtatious Flirting will get you nowhere the DCJ is turning on her bOSS🤣🤣🤣
David Tuer,I can remember that and I'm ancient!!! She can remember what everybody in the meeting discussed but is unclear what the meeting was about.😂😂😂 @Colleen Arezio- You read her right!! "No Immanuel They (saart) invented a spurious reason for disqualifying Lufthansa. @Mtokozisi Baleni - Too true. CR needs to form a task force to focus on bring corrupt employees (and Directors) to book. @Mtokozisi Baleni - That's a scary thought. "You can talk about Capitalism and Communism and any other ism but what we need are politicians who are patriotic @Dominic Przybylski @Derek Main - To have a conscience you need a belief of what is right and what is wrong. Simple Hey? @Derek Main - So we are always going to be ruled by psychopaths and we may as well accept the status quo? I'm afraid Dom & Derek are now fighting about who is the poorer. You were lucky😂 Parents? in our street we only had one each. @Dominic Przybylski - When he was trying to play tennis the other day. "Hey Pastor "@Pastor J - that's not evidence "Elvis "@Pastor J - I'm 76 "@Pastor J - Well Pastor "that' s a Joke Pastor @Mothusi Makhaza - Being a head of state is a high risk occupation.

I think Crisp answers - ziyabuya here!! Alex Mlangeni Lets not get carried away in excitement chief!! Imbokodo... like the hair!! But shame the lawyer has been consistent on fairness - but the evidence is led like she is guilty already or facts have been made. Now yall are wasting time Chair When she says `heeh` - I dont know lols That laugh of Miss Memela - I cant shame.. and paging with with fingers English and interpretation chowing miss Memela now..

Colleen Arezio,Guys this woman is not dumb. Shes actually rather smart. She doesn't answer direct question where she's involved but give examples. "I make a correction. She is dumb "Pastor J
Derek Main,@Colleen Arezio That may be so but I think the Chair is smarter and sees through her BS. @Mashao Mohale That makes her look guilty. @Dirk vd Westhuyzen Camila - Charles' wife. @Dirk vd Westhuyzen That's the one. @Hans Gunter There's one set of rules for them and a different set of rules for us. We must just pay and shut up. @David Tuer Yes - they had already lined up JK/AAR and needed excuses to drop the other bidders. @Mtokozisi Baleni That would mean voting the ANC out at the next election. It's the only way. @Gareth Hellyar Tehre were 40+ parties contesting the last election - take your pick. @Noxolo Tshabangu The BEE we have at the moment is not redressing anything - just making a few corrupt individuals very rich. @Gareth Hellyar That's a defeatist attitude. @Mtokozisi Baleni Careful what you wish for - you might get it. @Dirk vd Westhuyzen So let me get this straight - we'll keep on voting for a party that been proven to be corrupt to the core because they are a big party? Ridiculous. @Noxolo Tshabangu Yes of course - corruption knows no colour. @Dominic Przybylski What - the trickle-down effect. What a joke. "@Noxolo Tshabangu Not in principle - in fact @Dominic Przybylski The corruption we see in BEE is symptomatic of the greed of capitalism. @Dominic Przybylski Let's be very clear - the 1% have got it wrapped up. The odds are stacked against anyone else. @Noxolo Tshabangu We fix it. Harsh penalties for any transgressors. Nail down the rules so people like Memela can't BS that there are grey zones. @Dominic Przybylski I think we'd do a lot better if we got rid of politicians. They are more trouble than they're worth. @Dominic Przybylski I'm looking after myself but I also have a conscience and can't stand the injustice. "@Dominic Przybylski I say that if the wealthy can't grow a conscience @Dominic Przybylski Since when are the 1% governed by the same rules as us? They will never see the inside of a courtroom no matter what crimes they commit. @David Tuer Our society rewards psychopaths. So the very wealthy have those traits ie. no conscience and litlle idea of wrong and right. @Dominic Przybylski Then by extension I assume you don't worry about people that are extremely poor either. @Dominic Przybylski I put it to you that that is impossible unless you are privileged (eg. you have paid for accommodation etc). @David Tuer Not me - I'm not Dominic. I'm going to shout about it until the cows come home. I think society needs a reset - our values are all wrong. Psychopaths rule and that's got to change. @Chosen One I don't have all the answers but I do feel we could do a better job and we should be talking about how. @Chosen One The current inequality is not sustainable and leads to resentment and eventually violence. "@Person of interest See that's where Dominic and I differ - I may be sitting pretty but if others aren't @Pastor J Thanks Pastor. I also like reading Dominic's posts and often agree but we definitely differ on he capitalism issue. "@David Tuer 😂 ""That's nothing - when I was young we lived in a cardboard box.""" @David Tuer 🤣
Lorna Kavanagh,Smoke and mirrors is that the pilots wings insignia on her head? Now i see its an aeroplane on her head No one in SAAT executors to protect thecpmpany "Memela is supposed to be a lawyer yet she is not familiar with ""leading evidence""... i" SAAT must have lost out big time because of this contract. Just the exchange rate would have alone prejudiced SAAT.
Mashao Mohale,I feel for Ms Memela because she tends to be defensive before she even understand the questions @Derek Main Definitely

Evidence leader wants to prove her wrong using evidence before her.She just ignores not all questions @ Elvis shes has to dress up before she flies to jail and join R Kelly @Alex the point is we cant close tenders...lets arrest and jail the corrupt because @home affairs. municipality all its corruption too We need to get our country back from all these corrupt political deployees We are sick of it. police @ hawks keep on failing us i think we need a President like Trump who comes from business and sort all this nonsense this party politics is get us norwhere @ David maybe it will take a scary thing to happen to change to happen(jail the corrupted and corrupted) Everybody is tired here....take Memela to jail.....judge to your chambers ....evidence leader to your private practice case closed "I see a liar @Sthakathi i just noticed that too. guilty or not atleast lets be fair.

Noxolo Tshabangu,@dominic przybylski just sounds like you are making every excuse to not have BEE as a policy... understandable only because you may not be a champion of redress. @derek main correct... it’s not the policy but the people who run schemes to loot. And these are both black and whites @ Gareth hellyar you are being willfully ignorant @derek main there’s no issues with BEE then @derek main so what do we do? Get rid of the policy? @derek main glad you think we should fix it... I believe the same. But fix it “so people like Malema can’t BS...” ? I’m more worried about the Markus Joosters of this world. Malema has way less power @ stronger together I find your comments on black peoples having invented nothing to be ahistorical. Your comments show a dismal lack of education on your part... "@stronger together please go and find out who the Moors are... black peoples who invaded Europe @stronger together you are just ignorant and are actually not wanting real education. This information is there on the net. So you in fact do not want to know @dominic przybylski please don’t leave out the big white business that assisted the looting in the name of capitalism.
