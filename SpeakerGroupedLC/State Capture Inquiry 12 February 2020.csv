Neron Premraj,I mean like 😀 People sitting on all SOE boards are placed there strategically to manipulate the system
Briony French,were they not supposed to start earlier today? and now they late
Eliot Chauke,Zondo is still chowing the sandwiches 😂 when its time for adjournment... they are very punctual... Hofmeyer is a hired gun... dont miss the presser today at 12.. RET Forces are uniting to defend President Zuma Zondo takes sides. he protect Hofmeyer and abuse Memela @Mabunda 😂😂😂😂 questions on AAR since last week... Hofmeyer is playing. cant ask 1 thing for 4 days Hofmeyer shouldv finished wth Memela by now. Hofmeyer is wasting out tax money Hofmeyer was not well prepared for Memela. lets be honest... she should have finished by now. remember DCJ had to ask for extension. Hofmeyer is not doing justice to DCJ lets focus on Memela v Hofmeyer & Zondo Zuma is attending SONA tomorrow👀👀😂😂😂
Gareth Hellyar,Morning all. Also thought was going to be an early start. "With Mamela on the stand Its also a short day. Maybe only till lunch. Dead in the water. I bet got sick note today. "Watch the space. Or "Why is she there with her laywer "If you have not done anything wrong "AA a handout "And DOA. Dead on arrival. Lets hope that non of them get in another SOE company ever again. #employed. She is going to blow her nose on her sleeve any minute now. Its the udder one. Always. What does she understand? Always my understanding. Where does she work? Because its our turn to eat now. All on the gravy train. Big fat cats. Like Hlaudi. When they are lazy. She was laziest person there. What does she accept? KO!! "Is she deaf? Or Stringing a line. Thinks she can bamboozle Adv. Hofmeyer. Not going to win. Got her degree at Checkers. Who is Gedleyihlekisa? "SO Thank you.
Maggie Render,Just before they adjourned yesterday it was decided 10am start. I agree Gareth 😀
bongile sango,@Briony French that's what I know also they've said today they are starting early
Pastor J.J,"It was adjourned to start at 10.00 a.m this morning. But I wish you all a blessed and safe day.🙏🙏🙏 @Phillip Cwazibe You are 100 right. I also heard that bcos they did not turn the mic off after the adjournment 100% correct @Werner Opperman . The only thing big about her was the useless and baseless accusation yesterday SARS should go to Parktown and repossess all the beads. This Advocate is driving me to become an abusive person. "Ms Memela""s biggest mistake and to her regret will be to have hired this "" Supposed Advocate"". Yoh this is bad stuff" "@mandisi ntauzana ..Yes you are right brother. But we must agree that she is a ""useless"" one." ANY VOLUNTEERS.??????? Lets go to Bedfordview and change the locks and keys for the house.hehehehehehehe "Does the crop have an element of ""holiness"" to it @Kung Fu Kenny ...hehehehehe" @Eliot Chauke ...Calm down my brother All these nonsense TROLLS. You have a choice today.DOOM or MORTEIN. @BeachDude420 Peters ...Mummy had her mouth shut up this morning and is now chained to the desk for the rest of the day Does anyone need permission to give this Tannie a running klap. Permission granted I tell you @Jacqui Baumgardt . This Tannies is something else You are blessed my friend @Person of interest Someone unchained this woman again @anya van loggerenberg ....A College based in a block of flats in Hillbrow and run by an illegal immigrant.

Have a safe and blessed trip@mandisi ntauzana Yes@John Fagan ...The one who is as sick as a dog Have a blessed and safe weekend all
David Naidoo,Hi guys is this lady an advocate.
anya van loggerenberg,does anyone know who's going top be in the hot seat today? @Phillip Cwazibe thanks cant wait to see what she's wearing today 😂 maybe it is the coronavirus 😷 "You #GoKate "i wonder @Pastor J sounds about right 😂😂😂 """stealing is only wrong when you get caught ""- African proverb" if it is not bolted down it will be stolen checkmate "@Rory Pro its true and shocking
Phillip Cwazibe,Pastor J will be short today. Overhead Ms. Memela say that questions asked were irrelevant. Earlier she sighed and offered no comment to one question. This last question and follow ups will finish her @anya van loggerenberg ​ Ms Memela nad Mr Dzeku or Ndzeku. @anya van loggerenberg will see just now. Maybe in black today. @Patrick Haingura ​ Adv H proved that she read one paragraph in full including a sentence she was accused of deliberately leaving out. "@Dominic Przybylski commerce and not understanding ""conflict of interest""" Boom Boom 2062🔥🔥🔥🚒🚒 boom 2064🔥🔥🔥🔥🚒🚒 @ Anne M. ​ I would ignore such comments made by @dada ngova @ Dirk vd Westhuyzen ​ white monopoly capital is something that does not exist. Judge is lecturing Ms Memela. @ Sunshine 53 talkative...... @ Gerda 7 ​ She wants to debate or she is the type of listen to me because I am the expert. Politics. "Rory Pro ​Anya van Loggerenber Then you wonder why government can notbuy a laptop at Makro for R10 @ Rory Pro @ anya van loggerenberg I could tell my own stories but not here. @ mandisi ntauzana ​ Where inMount Frere? That was once my home. In town while I was student at Mount Frere High school. 1974-1977 @Hennie Cloete ​ BEE was not structured correctly. Kung Fu Kenny ​@Derek Main that is true. The new 51% partner does not even bring sweat equity into the business. It is like leasing ones identity. "@ Kung Fu Kenny ​ while not contributing equity

Kevin,Morning everyone.... I can't wait for cross examination....it's going to be hilarious Even Judge Zondo best behave today...Katie will even slam dunk him 😂 Morning Bev Our little Katie is going to get very significant job offers after this episode..... Slam dunk Judge....sit her down and muzzle her Hahaha Kate is so sweet and smiles so lovely to Memela....I hope an ambulance is near...memela is going into a panick attach shortly followed by a nervous breakdown. As HOD procurement she did nothing that was required of her post....SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE..... Whahahahaaha....slam dunk...proud of you Judge Problem is Mbanjwa can't see Zondo as a racist hahahaha.....now what now. Imagine if a person like Katie was put into the post Memela occupies in SAA.....Nobody will get away with nothing....Pity she is not BEE Cross examination is going to be exciting...Judge is going to loose his s....t with this Memela attorney's even more incompetent attorney. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE AS THE HOD woman....ai Oh wow......so conflict of interest is relevant to our lovely Ms memela.....what a shock hahaha Memela ....our Ms Katie CAN READ.....ai
Person of interest,Morning. tell them Kate my sweetheart. And a straight shooter She will be more cautious in future Clueless fo sho Eliot no. keep up my bruh "Just park the ambulance outside Crispy fried truth for lunch "Bruinman "yes Via Germiston! "Gerda with all her examples me me me I have to leave chat and I need a quick blessing Sit down. Judge in control Hurry up Adv M if you want your lawyer to reexamine. BEE laws should have been changed long ago. Ms Memela is clever enough to know for a fact that it wasn't her fault that her house got paid for out of this beautiful Bee system through DTI!!!
Anne M.,Go Kate! Ms Mbajwa is probably being paid by the hour. @dada ngova Useless at what? Are you related to Ms Memela or Ms Mbanjwa? "@Phillip Cwazibe I usually do ignore them @Thulani Bukani Hopefully the car is parked in the shade because they could be waiting a while 😉 @SABC Digital News Sound check please @SABC Digital News Please check the sound. @Rob Nel Only the last minute. Sound was fine before. "@mandisi ntauzana No Where does the board get it's information from in order to make a decision? From the HOD. "@mandisi ntauzana Ms Memela did not want to come to the commission "I'm not saying that Ms Hoffmeyr is perfect "@mandisi ntauzana The board decision is one small part in the total evidence. If you are issued with a subpoena "@Michael Wild Freudian slip? It's Memela @Elvis Malakoane Don't know. I don't recall if she said at the beginning of her testimony. "@Brian Benningfield Not much according to her testimony yesterday. ""I don't micro manage ......""." @Mbuso Ndlovu Yes Smooth - how to throw someone under bus while smiling. And it's someone who reported to you ........ @Thenjiwe Ngwenya Might be the reason she was suspended from SAAT. @Thenjiwe Ngwenya Ms Memela no longer works for SAAT - hasn't for a couple of years. @Gareth Hellyar Have to back to Friday morning to check if she said where she's currently employed. @Jean-Pierre Le Roux Head of Procurement at SAA Technical. @Thandisizwe Yeleki It's a commission rule that witnesses reply to Judge Zondo Yup "@Gabisile Mabuza I don't think she's clueless @Gareth Hellyar Not deaf @Jean-Pierre Le Roux She's an advocate by profession "@Robert Russell  What about giving information to them so that they could submit the best bid? @Gareth Hellyar Jacob Zuma
Paul Buchel,Beware. Hoffmeyer is angry this morning. True Werner her attorney got I hiding . "@Patrick Haingura​ "This is a first for me "When the ""Lukkamien "" starts 
Ms Cee,very big of Ms Mbanjwa....👏👏👏👏 was expecting argument from Ms Mbanjwa as always "Ms Mbanjwa🙈🙈😂😂😂 no examples today .lol 😂😂😂😂 Ms Mbanjwa is not her day today.... 🙈🙈😝@ Sunshine kanti ithini into ngama Xhosa ? @ sunshine 😂😂😂
Werner Opperman,Not big of Ms Mbanjwa. She didnt have a choice but to apologize Expect less interruptions today Ms Memela must actually just report to prison immediately after this. Will save us taxpayers some money @ Paul Buchel. Yep! Lol @ Pastor J. Spot on. thank you chair. Sometimes it seems as if the judge wants to get witness to see certain things. They should just give their version and be held to it later if it was found to be false. Much time will be saved that way Bright Orange yes.
Peet Venter,She's jùst lost the little credibily she had. Maybe the matter will become clear later but it seems to be a trivial point of debate at this point. All bidders were treated the same in this regard. She seems to be a very capable official in view of the technical questioning. My only issue is with AAR CEO's attempt to bribe her in paying the deposit in return for preferential treatment.
SIVA PILLAY,Kate's on fire...go girl You stole the 2.5bar
Phutiyana Maponya,"Ms Mbanjwa has been unsettled
Patrick Haingura,"Hi Paul
Kevin Simon,Hi Patrick. just track back about 5min This process shows a lack of common sense. Now you get why the outfits Michael Wild. Are you here?
Bev Daniels,Morning all "@ Derek @ Rob that happens when you download your degree from Google @ Rob too true And now Ms Hofmeyr will hit back with extremely hard questions "Sound is just as bad using headphones as I use headphones all day for my job @Makhosi she does not work for government anymore as she had to face a disciplinary regarding tender corruption?????? "@Craig
Sipho Zaca,"I can't stand to watch this Miss Memela anymore
Sherwin Peters,crisp answers does anyone here not accept that this lady is guilty? The Hof is ready for battle the DCJ is BOSS @dada have you been watching since Thurs? Zondo has indulged this thief and her lawyer let's all pretend @bruinman is invisible Mommy is behaving today sound is fed up with the witness can u believe she was the HOD of procurement at SAA Technical? is Mommy there? exzamples imagine the journalists reporting about testimony 🤣🤣🤣 ah Mommy yoh she's getting afraid now she wants to use BEE as a proxy for looting here we go ... homerun for the Hof trapped
David David,the look on her face when she is directed to literature
Joseph Gumede,😯 this woman ???????? She think that she know everything. to law imoto yemali yooh "Mrs Mbajwa is defending finish she is always forget important things 🤣🤣 Zondi take long for simple thing. This woman is a thief........she is playing games. Zondi is firing direct to Mrs Mbajwa I wish how she sleep at night nothing is remembering. nothing She know Mrs Mbajwa exemple even 💰 she forget She must prove that there was nothing was done unlawful "she is trying to dodge some questions 😂 but she's failing First time to see Zondi act like this 😂 please seat down Mrs Mbajwa. She's not remember
Albert Noah,It looks like Mrs Memela stood her ground in this testimony.
Derek Main,@Albert Noah Yes - a bold-faced liar. #Eliot Chauke Yes - Zondo knows a thief when he sees one. @Eliot Chauke Of course she can if she can't get a straight answer. @bruinman Careful bru - you're walking the edge. @Thabelo Emmanuel Atul! Is that you? @SABC Digital News Please fix sound. @SABC Digital News Thank you - that's a bit better. This testimony highlights the flaws in our tender procedures. They need to be fixed urgently to stop the corruption. "@Dominic Przybylski Capitalism is no silver bullet either. If it was @Dominic Przybylski So I put it to you that we should put our heads together to formulate a new economic model. Neither communism nor capitalism works. @Dominic Przybylski I like the sound of halocracy but it sounds more like an organisational system than an economic system. SIT DOWN! 🤣 @Dominic Przybylski I'm all for decentralisation and local decision-making. @Craig Johnson Thieves in training. ☺ @Fana Nkosi True - BEE is being used for corruption by criminals of all colours. "@Kung Fu Kenny Given our history @Kung Fu Kenny I think I have an idea - give me your version. @Norman Zwane 🤣 She's stolen all the redress. @Kung Fu Kenny Yes... Know that bit @Kung Fu Kenny Not news @Kung Fu Kenny I think that the sanitized version. @Kung Fu Kenny My take is that apartheid officially started in 1948 with the Nats coming to power. Legislated segregation and subjugation. @Kung Fu Kenny The colonisers (Dutch & British) had already subjugated the local population and they were consider sub-human. @Craig Johnson Of course - blacks were historically locked out of the economy. That is why some form of BEE is necessary. @Kung Fu Kenny Yes - they are race-based laws because the inequality caused by apartheid was race-based. "@Kung Fu Kenny No - SA is failing because we have criminals running our government. I'm still all for people being pulled out of poverty. If that vehicle is BEE "@Dominic Przybylski The way it has been run @Dominic Przybylski I put it to you that that has more to do with the greed of capitalism than with BEE. @Kung Fu Kenny AA & BEE are two very different things. @Kung Fu Kenny You never compared them - you conflated them. You said BEE(Affirmative action) - as if they are one and the same. @Abdul-Aziz Aziz Maybe you just dodged a bullet? @Kung Fu Kenny Yes - they are both race-based but they are not the same. "@Kung Fu Kenny I'm not going to defend the current form of BEE but I still think redress is necessary. And saying : ""Just move on"" is a cop-out." @Kung Fu Kenny Please see my coment above about not defending current BEE. @Kung Fu Kenny I support the principle of BEE not the current law or implementation. Capeesh? @Kung Fu Kenny Because of past injustices and current inequalities. Suimple. @Kung Fu Kenny Huh!?! @Kung Fu Kenny So just pretend apartheid never happened? @Kung Fu Kenny Of course not - where did I ever say that? "@Kung Fu Kenny As per Michael @Gareth Hellyar Our criminal of a former president. @Gareth Hellyar Showerhead.
Dominic Przybylski,"""Head of Procurement"" doesn't understand basic cash-flow?" The witnesses responses are as crooked as she is. If Memela was innocent she would have no problem giving crisp answers instead of long narratives full of excuses. "Evaluation seems to be based on ""What's in it for me?""" @Dirk vd Westhuyzen It seems that white monopoly capital is the private sector. "@Dirk vd Westhuyzen Race is used to make people believe that white = capitalism Problem with equating white with capitalism and black with communism is that communism has failed everywhere it has been tried so it gives the impression that blacks will fail everywhere too. @Derek Main It is well understood that capitalism is not a sliver bullet but is the lesser of two evils. @Derek Main There are many variations between the two boundaries in many countries. There are also completely different concepts like halocracy. "@Derek Main You're right but organisation and economy and politics are very closely linked She can't remember but even I remember what she said. "previous tenders ""engines"" vs ""components"" How come I can remember but she can't?" This is why we should get rid of SOEs where we can because incompetence is sustained by bailouts. In private sector they go out of business if they are incompetent. Two wrongs don't make a right. I think BEE has proved to put more people into poverty than it takes out @Derek Main Gini coefficient is higher now than it was in 1993 "The ""stranger""s bank account is not the person's bank account but from a company (who won a tender despite being the lowest scoring of three) which was used to pay for her house... huge RED FLAG." BEE is effectively an extra tax more than double company tax and we wonder why we get so little foreign investment or why Anglo American has move everything out they do out of the country. No surprise we have such high unemployment. Our biggest problem is fixating on the past instead of focusing on the future. Result is we are being left behind by the rest of Africa and the world. "Memela is neither stupid nor ignorant She is advocate and head of procurement yet claims not to know difference between cash and letter of credit?
Dan Brown,As usual the Idiot controlling the sound is asleep at the wheel. Amateurs I wish this woman would stop snorting like a pig and use a tissue.
Geraldine Lange,That smirk on her face is so annoying Thank goodness the big shoulders are under wraps today

mandisi ntauzana,Ms Mbanjwa is reckless with her tongue "Ms Mbanjwa is an attorney and a conveyancer........ She is not an advocate I think chair and Adv Hoffmeyr are missing the evidence and taking parts that they want to hear Chair is selling Adv Memela with the answer he proposes Adv Hoffmeyr is struggling........ Why is Adv Memela being asked on questions relating to Board decisions when she was not part of the board? She is being asked unfair questions "Chair must stop this thing of leading answers out of Adv Memela @Nyasha Mudyiwa my brother please note that the HOD of Procurement does not sit in the board where the decision of the parts tender was made. She is HOD correct leading a specific department "@Maryann Diamond No Adv Memela did not make the decision @Norman Zwane LOL please brother what has Adv Memela stolen? we havent heard such evidence here @Anne M. me and you both agree but the questions relating to the Board of Directors decision to award the tender to JM and not AirFrance are unfair as Adv Memela is not a board member of SAAT "@Michael Wild brother she was in the board meeting to make a presentation on a specific item @Nyasha Mudyiwa been following precisely....... unfortunately that the cherry picking of evidence and conflating of issues that is what has confused you "@Norman Zwane brother please @Anne M. that was her decision and for her to be present to the hearing for the past week is also her decision. Has nothing of being part of the board that b=took decision @Michael Wild its simple "@Norman Zwane @Anne M. evidence is not in isolation @Michael Wild i'll charge you for consulting on tax......

BEE is one of the reasons South Africa is falling fast. @Norman Zwane We ain't safe out here lol! "@Derek Main Would you like to know why apartheid happened? I'm not for apartheid "@Derek Main Our Khoi and San people of South Africa were the first indigenous "@Derek Main There are literally parts of KZN where the Zulu's killed anyone who got on the territory today known as ""No mans land"". They slaughtered Khoisan." "@Derek Main The plan was to divide all races to avoid the Xenophobia and overall war on eachother. But like everything else Xhosa and Zulu's literally sold their own people to the Brits so they can sell the Xhosa and Zulu people to the U.S as slaves. Did they teach you that in history class? BEE and BBBEE are racist laws. @Derek Main It's a apartheid law in 2020. Should be disbanded. This is the reason South Africa is failing and getting looted. ANC loots South Africa for 25 years. :ANC :Lets play the Apartheid card to avoid prosecution. @Derek Main Even normal black people agree in the US the BEE (Affirmative action) kills the economy. SABC=ANC @Michael Wild Non taxed should be added. @Derek Main When did i compare the two? "@Derek Main I never compared them @Derek Main The structure of BEE in South Africa started as Affirmative action. "@Derek Main Both are raced based @Derek Main There are statistics proving BEE put more black people into poverty than helping. Also i never said they are the same. "@Derek Main You don't seem to grasp the difference between taking a structure of AA and saying ""It's 100% identical to BEE"". BEE is a racist law in South Africa." "@Derek Main When you open a business and actually want to do business with the government you have to give up 51% of said company to a black business partner "@Joe da silva ""White Monopoly Capital"" is a term they use when they buy new Cars lol." "@Derek Main This same section of law applied when BEE itself came into existence in South Africa "@Phillip Cwazibe Also the reason why most businesses crash down fast @Derek Main The current form of BEE is exactly the same just a few of their policies changed to loot further. "@Derek Main I still don't know why though @Derek Main The principle and the structure of BEE should not be supported. "@Derek Main Apartheid did happen "@Derek Main Demond Tutu himself said ""Blacks lived better under apartheid than they do now under their own people"" "@Derek Main Who forced the Zulu's and Xhosa's to sell their people to the Brits while whites/colourds were enslaved here in South Africa? Nobody forced them @Derek Main cool. What did i miss
