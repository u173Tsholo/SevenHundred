Thapelo Motabogi,"why don't we get to the money issue
Solutions SA,@Thapelo my point exactly... all this processes and legalities are clearly documented... @Thando Failure of leadership or lack thereof... @Thando... CR must come out and say something The killing of the taxi driver was a bad move by the drug dealer... When unemployment rises All gov employees must allow salary cuts.. starting with number one. So said Tito and I agree with him @Derek Calm down he is not the real Khulubuze Zuma. lol Is not him boet Cheers @Videoboer Lol... Sad thing he said is recovering looted monies will take years. That gets on my nerves @Thando True Those 11 conditions take away independence Hlaudi Motsoeneng was the starring of this movie... Cant wait to hear his silly side "@Gee Peex1 Prophet Bushiri and Alf Lukau can surprise me We must stop calling this activities Corruption and just call them theft so that Police can investigate immediately than all this commissions How do you sign a contract that doesnt benefit your organisation but your competitor or suppliers? Never trust politicians... Their decisions are not based of sound economic values but their political interests I doubt Gabin Watson os not black This guy may loose his job after this teatimony @Cerebis A mad man in the white house @Cerebis We had our fair share in the past 10 years... Is time Americans feel what we felt Privatise part of SABC assets... It will never make money until then
makhosi nobhatyi,"It is so sadto say Uyinene Mrwetyana has been passed on @ Jack Sparrow we need to mobilize take these evil out our community push them to the sea "@ Thando Nkutha I don’t we can put all this in his shoulder the man is trying to safe us as country but his factional battle within his party is killing us "To operate "Sometimes we need to take bold step to turn around strategy You are not reasonable @ Thando Nkutha. We can save this country until those employees whom seat information about looting come forward with evidence that shows I steal money without their corporate I agree with you @ Thando Nkutha "This is painful yazi chairmen
mxolisi buthelezi,"@Thando Nkutha when there's 'no government' @Jack Sparrow the rate companies are currently retrenching is abnormal... I agree with you. Something drastic needs to be done This guy is clear. He knows his story Government is run by palookas!!! DCJ is the voice of reason
Thulani Maluleka,Makaveli
Jack Sparrow,@makhosi nobhatyi sad indeed. but i don't trust this government that we're listening about to have anything to do with death penalties @mxolisi buthelezi what is sinister about companies retrenching? @mxolisi buthelezi times are abnormally hard. The government is being abnormally flaky regarding policy and coherence. retrench the whole sabc. shut the pig down @Thando Nkutha if the company goes bankrupt then *everybody* loses their job @Thando Nkutha sabc is overstaffed. get over yourself @Thando Nkutha peeped? Huh? Nope. Overstaffed - more people to pay then possible income. Leads to bankruptcy. Eskom is overstaffed too. Hard to comprehend? @Derek Main YOU MONSTER! Give it up @Derek Main. You're arguing with a toddler "@Concerned South African nope. that's not what he said. he did say that they cut costs by one billion @Cerebis USA elected an unstable rogue as president. @Ace Spade resources should be used to develop the economy so that all that need can have jobs. give the mineral resources to the people and they'll just sell them to buy mercedes
Amukelani Mashele,they are carrying on as nothing is happening
Khanani Baloyi,m
Tumelo Arthur Mohale,He is gay Hahaha am gay of course. But I did not insult anyone. Peace @Thando Nkutha was just kidding dear
Thulani Bukani,our president is a liar. how can we trust Cyril Ramaphosisa? Cyril said half his salary is going to Mandela foundation. foundation must tell us where is that money and what is it doing Danie do you really believe you are African? "You know you called yourselves Afrikaaners "@Danie I'm not fighting. and I'm not being racist. if me and you went to Asia and told them that we are African. anyone in his right mind will say no "so you calling yourself African Ok Danie. I get you.
Derek Main,@Khulubuse Z Take a look in the mirror. Pay your workers you lowlife. @Sidney Setati And you know this how? "@Sidney Setati If he's proud to use the moniker "@Sidney Setati In a previous comment @Khulubuse Z Pay your workers scumbag. "@Sidney Setati I believe the man is so pig-headed and feels he is above the law - so ""Yes""." @Khulubuse Z That's a miracle - I don't have a sister. Lose some weight. @Thando Nkutha Unfortunately either some people get retrenched or everybody loses their job. SABC is not sustainable using the current model. "@Thando Nkutha The SABC doesn't have enough money. If they don't fix the situation @Thando Nkutha I'm not against the idea of the executives being canned first - they take far too much money with their exorbitant salaries. @Thando Nkutha He might still have a job but for how long? The SABC have got their begging bowl out - they won't survive another 3 months without a bailout. The crash at SABC #ProudlyBroughtToYouByTheANC @Gee Peex1 Do you actually believe a word Hlaudi says? He's a consummate liar. Maybe he wasn't the cause of SABC's problems - they were there long before him - but he was definitely the last straw. @Gee Peex1 Hlaudi has a psychological issue - I think it's called the Jesus complex. @Gee Peex1 Hlaudi sold the SBAC archives to DSTV for a pittance. Those archives were invaluable. @Gee Peex1 He's not right in the head. "@Gee Peex1 As far as I know @Gee Peex1 He brought the SABC to its knees. He also interefered with journalistic independence. @Gee Peex1 No probem - I'll also do some reading. @Gee Peex1 It would have lasted a while but not forever. He was taking too much money in salaries for himself and execs. @Sidney Setati Couldn't agree more - NEVER trust a politician! @Born free What the Shoprite CEO earns in 1 month as salary alone a Shoprite teller will earn in 50 years. We should regulate the amount of platinum released into market to prop up the price - just like they do with diamonds. @Gee Peex1 Hlaudi's busy hunting unicorns. @Born free Who said I support Fidel Castro? @videoboer Puff puff pass. @Born free I support Che Guevara - I think he was a selfless man who championed the rights of the oppressed and downtrodden. He could have lived a life of luxury but made sacrifices. Why do you ask?
PETER STAFFEN,i will not pay TV licence to watch the crap on SABC Raven Penny totally agree as this clown is only pushing that he has done such a fantastic job now that the SABC has competition from Mnet it is a problem for them Born free ​ you and i would smile if we got it

danie schoeman,Employees wont take a salary drop instead they wil increase petrol prices and tax us so there is more to steal
Jabu Nhlanhla,viva Peter ace pls man hi Bronx indeed Penny Bronx true is he coming Sidney
Kevin Simon,ANC stuck in left leaning policies and they can't fund it!!! Listen to what DCJ is saying... Well considered opinion.. "he SABC doesn't have enough money. If they don't fix the situation Cerebis ​Who broke the buildings?... The passage of Time....Surely you have a budget for home maintenance? Bronx Wavy ​if SA invest in itself or will be fine. no need for foreign invest. don't sell SA short... What you have at the moment is that Foreign investors are WITHDRWING their funds!!! ANC has run its course but SA'ns supporting them haven't seen they light. Will go down with it UNLESS CR17 does something innovative in terms of economic growth. Thando Nkutha ​he failed to come up with a strategy bar retrenchment and the committee disagreed with retrenchment rightly so.. This is NOT what he said!!!!!! Thando Nkutha Are you listening to the part about not signing contracts that don't make commercial sense??????? Danie Nilsen I'm blocking. Your comment are inflammatory and racist. Ace Spade ​Government funding is your taxes. Not everyone appreciates this..... Simple fact of life. "digitalemotionfilms ​if the SABC goes down nothing is lost
Ibo Thabo,These are the things the Zuma foot solders don’t want us to hear and therefore I calling the inquiry a useless "Guys go to the SABC website and try to read some of their so-calls articles
Cerebis,🔌🔌🔌🔌 🚥🚥🚥🚨🚨🚨 Who broke the buildings? The big hole is in Kimberley....used to be a diamond mine. "2018 Salaries between R1 The USA will be in a recession within the next 1-2 years. USA elected an unstable rogue as POTUS. He will destroy the USA. @Jack Sparrow POTUS stands for President of the United States @ANT CREATIVES LOL....I suppose Putin has now put his cloan Boris Johnson in London? 90% of known deposits of platinum in the world are found in SA and Zimbabwe @Derek Main Sibanye is starting to do that. There was however a lot of recycled stock in the system.
Wildthing,Judge Zondo is 100% right here. Ace you need to add proof to such statements. Ace what %. I agree that you have hard working people of all cultures. Ace that's a general statement. break it down by how many people you talking about and what is the low and high between them. I have many work Americans of all colours. but many people unemployed at the moment. ACE SA has ANC that's the issue. need new ANC members with a new outlook.
videoboer,I hope this guy doesnt drive a Toyota Corolla "We can fight from white side "South Africa can become like Brazil where all people live in harmony "Lew "the more ganja i smoke

The very same DJ chairperson herein legalised the stuff. just kidding
matimba nkuna,"anyone to help with data
Phillip Cwazibe,This gentleman has just shortened his stay as chair of the SABC board. The SABC should e charging no less that R100/month for the licence. Each TV linked by a decoder. No decoder no viewership. @Gee Peex1 ​ make the money where it is at....in advertisements! Somewhere the decision is not yours? Like wanting to air football for free? R2 billion lost due to sport.
Bafana Shabangu,😎

Born free,How much do these Board members get paid? There are too many board members getting paid mega bucks to sit on the board. really.. thanks 🖐 The board members of medical aid schemes earn 100's of thousands rand (400 000 -500 000)for one board sitting. This is over and above their monthly salaries. "Never mind all the free perks that come with these CEO I pay my license only to have to watch repeats.. repeats Obama was the Rogue along with Killary Clinton Yes Derek.. and the cashiers work long hours The Republicans voted fairly and squarely for Trump. Victory will be Trumps 2020 Employment in the USA is at an all time high. The Chinese are the influence of elections Putin takes out his opposition That's because they pay poachers to kill our Rhino +Thanks to the ANC The ANC government has no experience just Political interference in every sector. Derek.. why did you support Fiddle Castro he did nothing for Cuba?? Derek.. judging by your profile pic the two were a team.
Bernard Matolino,"My favourite Adv @Pastor J You are here mfundisi!!! How are you my dear sir!!!
