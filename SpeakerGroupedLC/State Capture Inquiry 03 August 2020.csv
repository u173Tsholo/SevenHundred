mandisi ntauzana,The Judge is not present? Judge was a Senior Counsel but I wonder what is wrong with her moving her own direct application. Adv Soni must submit
Mike Newlands,No way dont tell me she has not pitched again? Given the poor track record of this alledged judge Zondo will not be supprised she hasnt pitched. Question what will he do? This is a test of the Commission's power! @Redeemed Sinner 😀 Spot on "Like now @Dan Brown nicely put. Thats the plan of the government and she is using it here. The chair needs to be ruthless with her So she is stitting there wow what a cheek and insult @Caroline Hawanga I agree if she does she makes a mockery of this commission and the 80 whatever miilions spent. This becomes a circus. "@Caroline Hawanga In fact I would can the commission today So I bet she will not take off her mask if she speaks to hide her shame. I ll bet Lucky Montana is watching to see & get some tips as what he is going to do to weasel out of explaining his massive wealth and luxury houses @Musa Mabunda cheers 😀 Oh she'e ordering a beer her hands in the air "As she drags this out I see a huge drain with our hard earned tax money going down it Thought so that mask is not coming off Yaaa I lose great Oh yes Lootfreely House will bank roll her- they are loaded with our cigarette tax \ Compenatant black law firm what kind of insult is that! Are thier incompetant law firms?. And who cares what is the race please do NOT play the race card with us @Luthando Xhamlayo yes agreed lets keep race out of this- "The time is 10 @Mangalani Mangalani 😁 Same class "So her claim will be when ""unable to brief her council"" when her bullcrap is exposed will claim given under duress so unfair outcome." "My theory. She set the whole thing up @watson mutanga 👋 Yup R2m for life thats worth lying for Oh dear hes got a mask on all of a sudden! 11.40 so its midday and only move on must be wonderful to work for the governmemt @Musa Mabunda interesting makes sence 11.22 and still talking crap ooops did you see the look! She is like watching an ANC mp bull crap his way thru another lie in parliament. What a disgrace this woman is. It’s 11.57 and we just want the truth. "But she stands to lose a pension for life inflation linked currently at R157 @ Sharon this is a set up she fired her previous council to cause confusion & put this guy on the spot so she sits there and will claim unfairness Boom she treats the people with disrespect Let’s go Oh dear the mask is back on It’s now 12.18 what a waste of tax payers money this is Stalingrad ZUMA all over again Love the no masks on whilst practically kissing each other @jon millions Excuse me we are a banana republic we have the been one since Marakana not to mention corruption in billions this lady is making it worse mmmm no wrong not possible Marakana Esidimeni Colins Khosa Andries Tatane + no one in jail + corruption = Banana The lady represents the Zuma period of arrogance and ignorance bet she never thought this would happen😃
Granny Mokwena,This judge is so disrespectful yerr who cares if she's a sitting judge I can bet she will say apartheid somewhere soon. she reminds me of that one who said protect from yourself 🤣🤣 she's all over maan This is BS it's time for Zondo to be tough! "she's an embarrassment Soni? an agent she says these tactics must be stopped
Musa Mabunda,She must be subpoenaed Oh she's there "She will testify today Application will be decline and she will take the stand under oath "We waiting for so long for this day "DCJ Zondo says we can proceed without her affidavit "@Thulani Bukani hahahahahaha @Redeemed Sinner 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he hasn't and now he comes publicly and do some naughty things whilst owing us The Judge has been sworn under oath She wanted to represent herself and she was told it's nonsense and she must take oath That mask thing was a stunt still nxa She was appointed during the Zuma regime @Granny Mokwena 🤣🤣🤣🤣 let's get going LET'S GET GOING!!!!! Kasi hi yimele yini? one hour wasted "there's no need to explain and explain and affidavits just tell the truth Eish this woman maan "So she can talk DCJ says all that have been said so far is nonsense "She infact missed deadline to submit her affidavit She was appointed to the bench during the Zuma regime DCJ is smoothly decisive "@sekgome khame you're spot on I don't know exactly know what has been happening since 10am "The people are winning so far @Salmaan Abrahams I have got beer and pop corns "Ms Ngoye must have suffered a lot under this woman Broke lawyers take no matter what case and end up embarassing themselves We've been going around in circles People like Judge Makhubeles have been doing naughty things durig Zuma years and now they don't want to take responsibility for their mischief "@Cain Chunda focus man People have won "Nxasana is now a nuisance let's get going Lunch should 15 mins She wanted to testify with a mask sitting alone by herself but now she's briefing Nxasana face to face without a mask Shes's being frivolous now Zondo will dismiss the recusal application She's been spewing heaps and heaps of BS We knew it's gonna be fireworks but now we get bonus of a circus "She used to make herself a barbie girl during Zuma years of waste She will testify today "@Bophelo Malapela we are done with that aspect "@Bophelo Malapela he won't this woman must just testify In Limpopo ANC people had a fanfare event to give people Zozos @Anthony Ramasike she was appointed during the Zuma time of sheer incompetence
rock star,warrant of arrest granted I think that as of today we will have 1 less crooked judge on the bench
Jacqui Baumgardt,Morning all he needs to issue a subpoena @Mike Clark agree @Jackson Van Staden -why? "@Caroline Hawanga - exactly she jolly well should be impeached! ducking and diving - theat firepool is becoming very useful "Go Just issue a warrant for her immediate arrest what a banana! you are arrogant special favours????? direct comms with CJ youbare an ordinary person just like all the rest of us @Cedric Man Yan - we live in Zumaland "must say no
Hangwani Phaswana,Zondo must be in jail how much money has he wasted on this commission and for what ? he is looting public funds @Jacqui Baumgardt @Sharon your question is exactly why a medical doctor would.need another doctor to treat him when he is sick
Caroline Hawanga,Judge Makhubela should be ashamed of herself honestly @Jacqui Baumgardt I agree. She will keep playing hide and seek if DCJ allows this postponement @Mike Clark I hope she won't get her way today 🤞 We must just start with today's evidence and stop explaining to this attorney. He already knows everything the DCJ is explaining to him. as she raises her hand I hope it is to say she is ready to start this person is doing everything in her power to delay the hearing of her evidence... mxim DCJ is starting to get angry she needs Hofmeyer this one
Bongani Shibambu,this is circus go zondo she look scared😂😂 zondo ur the man 🤣🤣🤣🤣 she's in competent this one is she still testifying
Mangalani Mangalani,Camera lady is insane She is here I think Why is the camera lady not showing her face Nxasana under the bus Nxasana under the 🚌 But lawyers do it all the time. I have attended courts numerous times I have decided I will rather represent myself Shakoane lawyers are useless 😂😂😂 Shakoane lawyers must be given an opportunity to defend themselves. I wouldn’t want to use their services after what the learned Honorable High Court Judge Makhubele Here is educated Hlaudi Motsoeneng @anele mtiki this has nothing to do with accent. Content is just poor @Gerda 7 The lawyers will be paid. @Gerda 7 It’s her money but you are right she’s also wasting commission/our money Imagine poor lawyers who have to bring other matters to her court. They’re doomed as she has axe to grind & already accuse them of incompetent @Thulani Bukani Poor Nxasana
Dan Brown,"Zondo is too soft on these implicated persons. Government ministers Stalingrad strategy is the way of the ANC crooks and Zuptas. "I think Zondo has got the ""Stockholm Syndrome"" where he is a hostage to these Corrupt politicians and people and becoming their buddies." 800 Million "This is a case of ""if you can't blind him with science  Wasting Taxpayers money She's trying to wear Zondo down. Judge Zondo needs to show who's in charge here.
Thulani Bukani,She didn’t come again? I thought she was told that she should come and state her case why it must be postponed in person. Thanks @Mangalani Mangalani it’s better if she is here We don’t care if this could get her impeached. We are talking about state capture here. If it means she must be impeached then so be it. Don’t allow this madness DCJ These politically connected fat cats are so used to bullying the judicial system helped by the ANC. There’s no space for that here. They think they can talk nonesense and DCJ must be sympathetic. Bathathe Zondo. We’ve had enough. @Musa Mabunda did you say something about beer? You’re a wise man brother @Musa Mabunda 👊🏿 Is she gonna tell us why she wants a postponement? Exactly @Singi Mathebula Finish her DCJ 🤣😂🤣😂These guys are here to waste our time The advocate isn’t poor. He’s been instructed to apply for something that doesn’t make sense by his client. She is an ANC deployee so used to special treatment that she doesn’t understand due process. She’s drunk on corruption She is frying Nxasana now 😂🤣 Is DCJ gonna entertain this?
Nkululeko Mdluli,I bet next time she will say she's got Covid. True dat @Luthando Xhamlayo "It's a dead give away "But eventually Judge Zondo will bend "😃 R hunter they too if they were to get into office
Bonginkosi Sikhakhane,Bfware of the state capture looter's defendants
Singi Mathebula,I wil be suprise 🤬. she must be arrested. is she into politics 🤔 wa delela nwana loyi. does she need preferential treatment? can you imagine if Hlope was a chief Justice 👽 stupid woman. how was she appointed a judge. lawyer fired "hey wena will she allow this nonsense from an accused if it was in her court? the chair must make her pay costs for today's session my attorneys let me down. whose problem is that 🤔 "she must represent herself. they are politely saying to her trying to buy the judges face. "she is incompetent "proceed chair "the only thing that can save her from testifying is to be a drama queen chair getting anoyde "@Zakhele its now very hot for judge Nana ruling granted long ago wena 👨 how dare she want advocate Soni today? no more a car issue 😂 "eeh I will also be annoyed chair how does she handle cases in her court? all her court judgement must be reviewed. so this arrogance is a family thing🤩

Gabisile Mabuza,She is a sitting corrupt judge! DCJ is going for the jugular What is she saying? What is the relevance of all that she is saying about correspondence from the commission? my attorneys let me down...playing the blame game..🤣🤣🤣 This woman can't see that the judge is not interested in her nonsense This woman though... go for her DCJ Thanks DCJ for putting your foot down. Nxasana is in trouble..🤣🤣🤣 we are proceeding!...🤣🤣🤣 it's tough guys..you should have seen the look she gave to the DCJ...🤣🤣🤣 I can't sit here and do nothing...🤣🤣🤣 what has adv Soni done now?🤣🤣🤣 This is turning out to be an entanglement now...🤣🤣🤣 back to the affidavit...🤣🤣🤣
Luthando Xhamlayo,This lawyer is very poor. I will be surprised if Judge Makhubele doesn't change him too. He can't even put forward a convincing argument There she is She looks and sounds childish. She probably thinks this is a joke "Black Competent Lawyers Hahaha...I have never seen anything like this. What is the honourable judge trying to say here? I think this Advocate is destroying the bit of integrity that he had. He must have seen how the previous Advocate struggled to defend this judge. She makes all these guys look very incompetent.
Gerda 7,Does she really think she is above the law??Like Zuma?? "Cain  Zondo will not alow this !! The show must go on!Time waster ...this woman must testify today!!! Judge Makhubela is a sitting judge and is afraid that she will be impeached. This is going to be a looooong day!! The blind leading the blind!

Zamo Ngobese,@Bongani Shibambu you are so right. "can this lady just shut and admit all his transgressions DELAYING TACTICS
dennis oldude,your reputation of dishonesty precedes you unfortunately Under her watch she managed to agree to a huge loss of transnet money - for the benefit of less than reputable suppliers - like the siyayas no you are not an ordinary person you are a compleat squirmer say something that means something? impeach her and get some competence on the bench and in the commission They were your attorneys - so what is the problem - they acted on your instruction - and you are supposed to be well versed in the law - so what has this speech got to do with the present situatiion? Obviously a case where corona could have helped resolve this issue? So virtual consultation - that works for the rest of the world - couldn't be used by this arrogant lady?
Naledi Barron,I call them verbal vampires. "Precisely Caroline. She's a 'verbal vampire'. She'll talk your ears off This woman is demonstrating a brilliant example of what is known as 'obfuscation'. A big word that simply means to blow lots of smoke into people to cloud the ability to see or get to the facts....

Buti Sipho,This magogo she's wasting our time Delay tactics But she's eating more time finally Delay tactics
Nkosingiphile Cedric Shabangu,This lady is arrogant. Ministers have appeared before this commission. She must be thinking she's running SA. They must suspend her as a judge. if they do such. suspend her until the commission finalise her matter Spare a thought for the PRASA board that and executives that had to deal with this lady.
andrie van eeden,"Watching this Oh please...she is just going on and on in circles endlessly

Jon Snow,"Judge Zondo is reaping what he sowed right now. From the moment he allowed the first person to use delaying tactics @Dominic Przybylski No Prosecution Authority "Before we know it anyone know an estimate of how much the commission costs per day? Nearly half a day now... "@Dominic Przybylski BECAUSE SHE IS COMPLETELY INNOCENT cant sanitize stupid unfortunately he's clenching his jaw like crazy 😀

Dominic Przybylski,Seems to be using the Stalingrad Tactics same as Nhleko to drag out testimony so rambling and verbose that the commission will not be able to make any meaningful progress. COVID-19 is a wonderful excuse used by all nefarious characters. Wow! No wonder our courts have such a backlog of cases. Come on Zondo please tell her to stop wasting your time. """I think we need to have some kind of finality 9 minutes 20 seconds left... 8 minutes left... You've already used 5 minutes How about spending an hour discussing whether 10 minutes is enough? Zuma regime same as Rama regime - same people at the top. So after 80 minutes having achieved nothing it's time for another cup of tea. This is my opportunity to make a scientific study of how long 10 minutes lasts in Africa. Stopwatch is ready. 1:07 paused while Zondo speaks """purely of a sexual nature""?" Does anybody know what NPA does? Soon will be time for lunch break. Lunch break coming. Chin masks are very popular. 10 minutes have passed surely? "He said ""I'm this and that..."" What is ""this and that""?" Why is the judge so determined not to testify? She was obviously wasting his time same as now. They all wasting time to try prevent Zondo Commission from having time to complete. This is such a frustrating farce.
R hunter,how this was made a judge is a mystery... useless.. "woohoo ha ha she is not impressed expecting her to suddenly start coughing and Covid19 being blamed. the law has be laid down ...tell him i am sick wena! every court case this women presided over needs to be re examined...!

Sipho Jimmie Mthandi,Really is she a judge? Judge Zondo is getting impatient with this so-called Judge
sekgome khame,The Deputy Chief Justice is a very patient man I must say.. I strongly suspect that this Judge is from the same wattsapp group as Faith Muthambi...Limpopo crew that was part of the Zuma henchmen. The DCJ can see through all this B.S Adv Nxasana should have never agreed to represent his client.Maybe he's desperate for business or something..Professional integrity means nothing these days.People will do anything for money. I still maintain that this commission should have put at least 2 other retired Judges to assist the DCJ. @Zakhele Tshabalala ...They love clearing their lying throats.They learned from the best..Zuma😂😂
HALO,We must not let the anc win any more elections The government steals resources and they allowed the crime rate to skyrocket. For the sake of our country we must not let anc win another election. Not eff or anc. After all this let's see who gets arrested. You know the system is corrupted when the process of conviction is so complex. Why not just get straight to the point. All this time wasting. After all of this we'll see who gets convicted and sent to prison. I feel like none of them will get arrested Maybe because she is guilty? It's not so difficult to see when someone is guilty especially when under pressure Welcome to South Africa. The country with corrupted politicians who steal money and the country with the third highest crime rate on Earth. Enjoy your stay!
