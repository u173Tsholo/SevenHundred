Pastor J.J,@Arthur Dell Venete Klein/Eskom We have the wannabe Dolly Parton on the hotseat again. This time will be really hot tannie @Andre Gerber Bro. I am just about at that point where I will be considered a sugar daddy if i took Dolly onboard. hahahahaha Dont try to say anything but the TRUTH Sis Dolly. She said her name is Venette Kelin when taking the Oath. I want that Oath to be revoked. @Elvis Malakoane Do the necessary Bro Ladies. Do any of you know what this Dolly hairstyle is called. I am going to ban Aunty from ever doing it. @Naledi Barron Will Inseciticde or firelighter have the same effect? @Roza essack Morning my Darling friend "@Mbuso Ndlovu Maybe you have a point there.Perhaps we can find another way to ""punish"" the older people. Any suggestions?and what should be the cut off age. I will suggest 110.Anyone younger.tronk toe" @Russia Magezi what about a sjambok @Paul Buchel We have to accommodate the Nkandla Rapper. GM Captain "I have learnt that ""quite interesting"" means precisely "" I dont believe the nonsense you just spat out""" @Mtokozisi Baleni Is it not the character of the people that helped him rise to that position that needs to be questioned? Just a thought. He did not do it alone surely @Naledi Barron Exactly the point I tried to make earlier @Cory Steele is an impostor. He is actually the Nkandla Rapper @SABC News Kindly take an urgent look at the comments posted by @Cory Steele "It seems to me that the ""ENCA REFUGEES"" made this SABC chat a lot more lively in the last week. We should be thanked for this well needed change." @wim louw Pensioners discount? @Thobani Mkananda I must also testify bro. @ALTA Neva Eva Bokkie @wim louw I am going to do exactly what my granddaughters do.....Love you more Bro @kevindbn007 Tannie Dollie. a.k.a Venete Klein @Gerard Victor I must say that thought crossed my mind this morning when she took the Oath that she didnt mean too. hahahahahaha @Xolani J Masemula Plotting another hatch job perhaps? @ALTA Please send me some of your headache pills asseblief @ALTA Yes pleeeeez. Must I take it with Rum? @SanFran Arnold @ALTA @wim louw I will make a rare exception and take 2 with 2 glasses of Rum. If it doesnt work I will repeat every hour @Valencia J Darling. Me tops. How are you feeling @Valencia J I sent you a message on whatsapp that you didnt read. @wim louw I am finding out 2 glasses at a time Bro @Valencia J We was right there. The A team did the Repo. Elvis is that dik oke driving the maserati. @Elvis Malakoane @wim louw Alta and B said take 2 Panados with 2 glasses of Rum. If needs be repeat after an hour Tannie Dollie. If you came with a clear and honest mind and no agenda you will not have any of these memory problems Tannie Dollie. Give me another panado and rum please @Naledi Barron I am too weak to mix my drinks. Perhaps I will have another headache tomorrow and we try that one @wim louw That concoction fixed my eyesight and I can see aunty a lot better. dont need the testacles to see clearly anymore. "@ALTA ..I think so. I didnt know I can sing until now. I have been singing "" I can see clearly now"" Does that Rum do that?" Matshela Kocko is apparently an Actor.

No he won't be questioned it is for his lawyers to make arguments as to why they cannot come to the commission "@Yolo More his lawyers are to appear @Owen Nyilika in my opinion quick and easy money an no concern for the actual office they hold @Sabelo Nxumalo only in SA🤣🤣🤣 Venita was enjoying the fruits of corruption while at Eskom. @Buyani Mhlongo yes he wants him to recuse himself @MOLLY PHUNGULA hello and welcome Why are you telling the DCJ how to run the show??? He was there and now???? The Ace faction in the ANC is dangerous not only for the cANCer but for our country. It is scary "You are splitting seconds here madam YES DCJ!!! This was all you madam.

Mtokozisi Baleni,@winnie matlejoane WHAT about march for Esidimeni victims and Marikana. Am not a zuma fun but for me the fact that he rose to be the president of this country tells a lot about his character. we seem to always underestimate him This is Politics not a church so if we expect Politian's to behave like us it wont happen but lets hold them to account @Simphiwe Kubheka she now stays in Stellenbosch captured @Vuyisa Msomi Hes a big man he needs to refill. Hes on top of his game @Mbuso Ndlovu Free lunch??? there is no such:yougotthis: I think we have too many Political Parties here...If we have 2 they will challenge each other neck on neck and improve peoples lives In SA if you want to be rich be a Politian if you want to serve people be a teacher Edwin Sodi house is 85million is it paid off? how much bond is he paying? proudly created by ANC The Voting in this country will always remain in colour lines simple because the freedom was demanded by the oppressed never given by the oppresser @ Anne M. i agree but we failed to unite with no strings attached.

Moleti Moseki,morning all Why is Zuma above the law still. How could she sign something she was not present for All these implicated must be jailed at Robbin Island. Where our new history will be based on. Put them all on Robbin Island....... and they must be seen by all tourists behind bars. Sabelo..... I hope you not the one that started that tweet 😅😅😅 How are they going to pay back them money..... if they are using that money they must pay back for bail applications🤔 @Danel😅😅😅🤣🤣 Danie 🤣🤣🤣😅 @Alta......could not agree more. She must start her own party. So we can vote differently Motswako Production should be investigated as well. (That is Mrs Khumalo production company right) Guys I thought retirement age was 65 max. No wonder everyone working for State can do they stealing or taking of state funds so easily. Cause age works in their favor when they have to go to jail. At the age of 60 take your retirement package and go. How did Romeo end up working for Eskom.... I thought he was with MTN nigeria By who? What does one need to be part of a board....? Or all you need is connections You know those feelings you experience when watching a football game.?This commission is making me experience with feeling now😢😢😢 looking at the paper made the difference..... oh please Pastor.... I haven't seen that one🤣🤣😅😅wonder how much does those productions pay😂😂😂 @Pastor 🤣🤣🤣🤣 oh no old lady.... your signature is on the settlement "R18 mill divided by 4 =R 4 "@R4

HALO,"Society is going to come to and end "People treat politicians like celebrities and let them do what they want "You should know how to be strict against our government. Remember But you people wanna be fans of politicians like how people support sports teams. Yourll are too relaxed about how government should be operating. Civilians are not strict enough. "That fatty eats too much "Remember Sinners prosper because some use black magic and work with jinn and demons. Other sinners are just very very hard workers. "Fact "But the youth can only save us when they get into political power "Well anc is not an honest government "The African race already has a bad reputation in this world in the eyes of many racist The only reason why I would trust a white government is because white people have their priorities set on running a successful enterprise and not just about making profit. "Look at how much money this anc had stolen "How many people in this chat trust and voted for jacon zuma? Don't you feel like an idiot now jabob* accused not convicted* "You see that's why politicians go to poor settlements "Women also go bald """the wickedness of a woman showeth on her face""" Pray that the anc and eff are no more

Zenith740,@PastorJJ I agree
Gugulethu Dube,Miss Klein probably probably received some filled bags from the Guptas
Jenny Whitewaves,@Naledi Barron keep safe @Mogau Mphahlele so true that is why any one party with a big majority is going to be big time corrupt I wonder how many ANC voters vote not FOR the ANC but against other patries parties Biggest challenge for any party is to convince voters that if the ANC is out of power the SASSA grants will still be paid. The ANC will grant the basic income grant to make people more dependent @Buyani Mhlongo The ANC have convinced people that the grants are only happening because the ANC pay them I agree with no ANC the country and everyone will be richer the difficulty is getting it so @Buyani Mhlongo about 1/2 the ministers as well "Only new cars at a limited price only made in SA Less parties
