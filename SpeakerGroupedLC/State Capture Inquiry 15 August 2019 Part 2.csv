carnoth ngomane,they deliberately want to prolong the proceedings "@Charlene Botha i doubt there was a single job created even in India "There was no desktop research Ace protocol Thabethe taking a bullet for everyone @ Lee you can say that again @Wesley Myburgh its an open secret the money improves you to deliver the service @Ewald Kruger these guys are smart but they have to act stupid to cover their rubbish why dont you survey before you build or drill "@Sandile Mkhonto you are correct but you can build and survey later  Be ready for more desktop lies tomorrow guys

Funny all dead before the eyes of Guptas @Charlene Botha lol. Guptas were your president....dictating where to go India and Dubai was the distination @Charlene Botha "@Madelein Huxtable Guess we should blame most "Yes @I Am Free  @I Am Free Zuma took the economy from 3.8% down to 0% Not a joke @I Am Free LOL @I Am Free But Mbeki NEVER seem to have phuza thursday face like Ace and Bathabile @Jacob Zuma Family bread winners and graduates need jobs "But South Africa has never ran out of milk Don't we have our own milk in RSA? fARMS?

Nicholas Musanga,WHAT CAN I SAY.... I;M NOT GETTING THE WORDS..
Norman Zwane,There was a desk top research!! by Thabethe himself? Heyi siyashaywa la! Why do people call googling a research? So the model was based on collecting milk from Buffalo's not cattle. @Pastor J Turns out in SA we prefer cattle milk rather than buffalo. It does not sound right Mr Thabethe? R100 000 000.00 =R1 Million It was R837 000 written as R837 Million. What is a Million doing there? "Dairy plans cost R17Million
Mbuso Ndlovu,@ Norman you are right BUFALLO MILK ?? @fikile mbokodi agree This poor guy is in trouble Don't worry Fikile Bheki Cele will collect him if he runs away Why Zondo is not laughing Are Judges not allowed to laugh Jonh are you related to John Legend?

Anne M.,They have to sort out the microphones "@Thami Nobela Aren't those figures for beef @Hosia Modiga Former head of Free State Agriculture Dept @Michael Moeketsi Sello He was implicated by a previous witness. I think the questioning is a bit different under those circumstances. @Thabo Mzamani PeterMbana Thabethe Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona 😂 I am sure the DCJ will have a list of people to be prosecuted for perjury when he gives his report to the President @Louis Niemand It's easy not to ask questions when it's not your own money @Thabo Mzamani Looks like it

Mal-Enema and Zuma want to keep our current PP in office........ to keep them out of jail.... the NPA is next to be attacked. Next week we do the alphabet I find that amazing.... that there was budget that had not been stolen by then A degree All of which wee never done before Zwane started paying the Guptas money DCJ .....kick him in the balls
Kapn Krunch,dont you guys get depressed thinking about all of this
Steven Lindsey,please
Wanachi,just googles USA is the highest milk producer followed by India
Tsepang R,Well he asked us to google so I did. The largest milk producer is the USA Mr Thabethe Crying over spilled milk lol "If you try to protect politicians you won't succeed in this commission. Koloane had the same approach and demeanor Chair its 4 o'clock haha ANC governance personified Wow! Incompetence at its worst😂😂😂
SNOW PATR,jobs are dead
M Mok,US is no 1 Done done done lol...Lying Done Value add? wedding and they signed it how? done

SA Fitness,SA WILL GROW LET THE BLACK FARMERS ARISE YES WE ARE ALSO WATCHING @IAMFREE FROM NEXT MONTH WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE STATE INQUIRY ORG FOR LIVE STREAMING THE COMMISSION YES CIC MALEMA IS WATCHING'
Rangarirai Taruvinga,pls compare small holder dairy development as opposed to commercial dairy development look a Kenya model small scale farmers would keep a few milking cows and sell their surplus milk to a buyer. a milk collection system can be put in place to collect all the surplus milk and take it to a factory for processing
Blaze 613,lets talk about how the anc is milking this cowntry
Michael Moeketsi Sello,I’m sorry to say this: this is cross-examination not giving his side of his opinion @Anne M I really understand you but my problem is the way how do they put questions on this man. "But Mr. Thabethe just he can comment I don’t think he came with his lawyers @ Thami Nobela Totally disagree with you @ I Totally disagree with you @ I Am Free: enquiry is state your statement (what you have known till to date) and cross-examination is to test your statement is right or wrong "Then if it’s like that @ I Am Free: if the person said he can’t comment or don’t know The kind of questioning here by AdvQcabashe put to Mr Thabethe is for Court purposes nt for enquiry:they must apply for Cross-Examinations cause people will not want to come here 2 tell their stories
Cerebis,D for Dummy Thick file.....lots of travelling?? "I love Namibia. Very balanced country that got over it's bad past and only look forward Hehehehe I will not try to milk a buffalo.... Zwane Protocol....nonsense This guy needs some of the Commision water....like zuma? Judge Zondo has previously asked why there is no action on the commision evidence. We must ask the new NPA Director? I like this evidence leader lady Thabethe asked to come testify as he was implicated by previous people on this commision. This guy is shamefully corrupt. I am sad to see this. Eish @I Am Free JIP 100% correct @Buyiswa Mnyani Agree! How is he going to sleep tonight? Strategic protocol partner? 🤔🤔🤔🤔😎😎😎 I think he should have a fake heart attack to get out now....he is in deep trouble Judge Zondo 😂😂😂😂 He should do the Leeu loop?

Buyiswa Mnyani,we are burying this father this sunday does MP attend to the meetings chaired by Zwane and Faith?

"now AWL demand Bathabile to go back to gov @Cerebis he is very ashamed hence I said he shouldn't go home after this. he deserves ice cold water. @Wilson Hishono he doesn't look like a type that down fermented drinks. @Mbuso Ndlovu what do you plan to loot? @Robert Russell they are not winning this time @Thami Nobela not this time around imagine your child and mine wishing to have FILA shoes and nice phone like thiz pips kids. and we bang our heads and feel like lozers like we didn't go to school like thiz pipls.

Samuel Mompati,This Thabethe is lying with a straight face Deputy Chief Justice
Wiliam Mnguni,Lol..Protocol ntate
Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,I'm just waiting for this guy to say he was never in Free State... it's coming soon. he will say he didn't know Narayana... wait for it Gupta holiday to drink Buffalo milk... buffalo milk is too strong... he is still hallucinating.
Louis Niemand,remember he is under oath and he still lie just show to the character of the man @Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona LOL
Dominic Przybylski,What is this man employed to do? He seems to have no competence at all. This government has no concern for expense or productivity. The tax fairies will pay for everything. It's not easy to ask questions when you have no idea what questions to ask. Heh! Government money is spent on private choirs and individuals. Money is there to be blown on anything or anyone. @makhosi nobhatyi Probably not even an employee of anyone. """Protocol officer"" is there to make sure the official doesn't ask questions which will expose the scam." Strategic partner = people who pay the bribes. Surely the money has to be preallocated based on the request for more money or can anyone in government ask for more money without justification or conditions? Feasibility study and EI were not done. Be cheaper to build the dairy than to make the plan. I paid architect to build my house. He makes basic plans for free and only gets paid for design when the house is built. Government knows the country is going to collapse so they just grabbing as much as they can while there is still something left. @Charlene Botha Yes please. Can a newspaper publish those plans please. This not only happening with Estina and FS. It's probably happening throughout the country. """The model we were looking at we did not have."" What?" This would be hillarious commedy if it wasn't bankrupting us.
Nelson Musoliwa,What was happening in Free State Vrede dairy farm is pure criminal activities in the name of govt by Ace and agric officials
barbara broadbent,Why does the chairman keep reiterating what she is saying? He probably wont pitch tomorrow @ Brennan Smart guy!!!! protocol my foot!!! Do a Zuma and walk........ why does judge keep preempting him?? absolutely was Lourens De Jager!! "thats because there is no logic
Nobby's Photography,they were creaming it at the dairy in the FS
Naomi Motshwari,legal representatives are there...i guess they cant help at this point. Thami please organise some Legal representatives to protect him cant he throw the toilet? cant he throw the towel? im for fake heart attack to save him Thami please throw towel for your homeboy...
Kevin Simon,Eish must please explain! 👀 "Stutter With such obedient civil servants all we need is upstanding honest leadership. In the wrong hands the consequences are State Capture...... Is it a culture where you don't question authority even if it means to your own detriment and damage to your reputation? "Zuma But the strategic partner contributed NOTHING!!! Can we please bring back the death penalty for corruption. Please....Please. like China. Our trading partner. Clueless clowns. Problem with listening to these witnesses are that they are covering their arses. I really struggles to follow their logic which they cling too. They got the cart before the horse. Zwane and Ace had taken the decision and these guys were used to create some semblance of due process after the fact. Very obviously did not work. Gaps too big.
Dumza Maswana,The evidence leader isn't here to play @Christy stop it 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm interested in what makes it not easy to ask questions... @Thami Nobela your homie is disappointing """Mic chairman"" 🤣🤣 He must ask for recess Adv Gcabashe doesn't wanna let go WORDING no Norman 🤣 Conditions of the service @Lourens De Jager that's a very important question 🤣🤣 Mbuso 🤣🤣🤣 I think he's got Masters in Corruption Yes Salmaan "Zondo's English Stop right there Buyiswa...

Setjhaba Mofokeng,can the commission adjourn for today Me. Thabethe needs to go rest
Manfred Nkonki,The only way to stop the cronies from taking a bullet for the team is for the NPA to start acting on the evidence presented here at the commission. These people know that nothing is going to hpn 2 thm @makhosi nobhatyi I understand... I believe most people would like to see atleast 1 prosecution arising from this Commission. But yep...will wait for another 2-3 years for that to happen lol just a plan...17m. wow ohkay @Buyiswa Mnyani
Wilson Hishono,@Buyiswa Mnyani A cold beer not cold water or a bells maybe @Robert Russell I can not even be relied upon @Christy you will go immediately who could be the new PP Zondo no nonsense its stakeholders maybe and not strategic partners because there is no formal relations even @Buyiswa Mnyani 😂😂😂😂 @Cerebis 😂😂😂 1000 million rand

Granny Mokwena,million again so much education and you can't count difference millions and thousands..mmm 😂😂😂 doesn't make sense I'm with you @Buyiswa Mnyani it's painful infact only plans cost R17 millions????? heyiii these fancy words the pure disrespect of taxpayers money by these so called officials is sickening to say the least!!!
