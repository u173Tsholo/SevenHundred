Morgan Naidoo,"Do not over expect things today unless the process as started and we in an hour into it. There is every plan to delay this another day the mask that speaks no evil no lies
Mntase,@Rob hahaha "Pastor J. Are you here @Karen x You have the option of hiding your chat if you donlt like it he looks nervous @oom blik HAHAHAHAHAH "He claimed he's afraid of Covid exposure As I predicted: lawyer waffle wasting time
Mondli Nohashe,Is JZ going to be present ?
ma baker,it is going to be a loooong intro by Zuma's lawyer. sure he will be arrested if he does not pitch .....oh I see he has arrived. there are many implications if Zondo recuses himself . I don't think he will. go DCJ The DCJ is nobody's fool. well done. he was speaking to his registrar. it is actually the state of capture. when zuma governed he didn't feel sensitive fron fat cakes to cookies. the cookie jar. the hawks can do with the report as they wish. There is not going to be judgement
Nozuko Ngodwane,one day truth will prevail today business pls
Don Jeshuddha,we all know the truth long ago ha-haaa "a long ha-haaaa I can talk about the Guptas and Z for 666 hours! this adv. is going to talk for 3 weeks as his intro. I'll come back here after 30 March 2021 """JESUS"" is today really alone..." At the mo Z does not know where he is and for what
Aubrey De Bliquy,I doubt very much Zuma's presence is required at the recusal hearing. Lighting up a dooby to get my brain ready for this. @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA OK thaks. Well if there is another judicial double booking an excuse is not needed. @Karen x Why? Don't you like freeom of unpopular and popular speech? They should be allowed to take off hthe masks. Davos economic forum is busy having a thrill at the success of their scam. If it is true that ratio female male is 7:1 then who is the glutton that has 14? She's gorgeous. How do you insist yes no questions are answered yes no? Friggen genius. Wionder who does not want this conversation to take place? Let them have an appeal hearing tonight and let Zondo's peers on the highest court resolve this. Their argument renders it impossible to have any commission at all which is what they want. This is how you argue in favour of a cover up. Zondo never created this situation. Mr Zuma did. Our measure as a civilization is how we treat the weakest and most vulnerable among us. Right now that is Mr Zuma. These words are going onto the record. This advocates passion is at least epic. He is putting the Commissioner in the dock to save his client. How desperate is that? Brillinat advocate at least or most. We would see more clearly if we looked in Mr Zuma's eyes @Moshoeu Mabusela I think he is doing both> Who will advocate for Mr Zuma? When times are low our Hight courts celebrate the dignity of our law. defending the law is defending South Africa's dignity; and who will be the advocate for Mr Zuma with as much passion as this advocate? The measure of a civilization is how we treat the weakest and most vulnerable among us. @Valencia J Mr Zuma is entitled to his dignity. You have to be blind or heartless not to look for a moment through his eyes. This advocate is brilliant. We are watching a new road our law is equipped to traverse. Epic Who needs a movie if you are South African. Can we make this a permanent feture. He is trying to haul out all Zondo's laundry. That is going to crucify his appeal. I don't think Zondo is stressed at all. Who will judge when the line has been crossed. Those who want to move the line or those who want to tow the line? spare me the lynch mob mentality... Ughhh Five friggin brail cells and they all spell hate... LOL "It is plainly absurd. Otherwise any commission would be impossible I am surprised there are only 7120 watching our of 7 billion. @carol berry You are missing the main event. This is Epic. South African Judicial system at it's finest. "@Kebalipile Jacobs I am sure Zondo is listening carefully Zondo will listen carefully and decide what his duty is as a Commissioner firstly an rule accordingly. Brilliant advocate. LOL Commission of enquiry into allegations of State capture. Who would mot that to happen? THe capturers. "@Sarel Klopper If you look at his challenge through his eyes You cannot have an unprejudiced investigation into state capture. Either it did or it didn't happen. "@Joshua Boitt Our government are appies at corruption No lollipop for coming to the commission. He is attqacking us now.. The world of small screens. Hehehe It was ridiculed because it was delusional. I thing Zondo's shield and strength is his integrity. He will not flounder. "No doubt the Gupta strategy to weaken the commission. They sound toxic They lack the guts to be under our law and will likely be fugitives if they are complicit.
Nondumiso Soko,mybe they should let the president rest... and focus on ramaphosa before we wake up and the country is gone (I know it was long gone but let's pretend it's not) don't forget guys DZ22 Karen why??? duduzane Zuma for president ‚úäüèø my president ‚ù§Ô∏è‚úäüèø duduzile is very pretty üòç Zuma my president we are all here to support you eff did nothing Johan Rupert must also come here you were also his legal advisor... we want everything which ANC will reign Supreme???Ramaphosa vs Magashule 2022 was a supporter??? üôÑ Zuma I believe you Zuma I stand with you if you want to start fire Zondo you must come correct or don't come at all I've seen this before bathong zondo denying everything you gave them no choice it's not personal true mr skhakhane... Zuma is already guilty in the eyes of this commission which is extremely unfair @Kevin to who? skhakhane is educating zondo ü§£ü§£ skhakhane on fire today skhakhane proving malema wrong.... black excellence end this whole thing vele... besides is a waste of money dissolve this entire thing... where's Trevor Manuel guys?? skhakhane is black excellence Zuma could talk but zondo will not listen because he wants him guilty @Mike that shot was for malema our people have been denied opportunity for far too long... skhakhane take your time
Joshua Borias,""" HI Everyone.Hope de President Will Laser-Focus On His Then KPA(Key Perfomance Areas) as Head Of Government & Head Of State """
Freddie Van Rhyn,Zuma thought he approved a puppet when he approved dcj Zondo for this commission. Big surprise Dcj Is no puppet camera lights action hi guys I want to help Zuma pay his lawyers. you can pay all donations into my VBS acc no 54321
Dominic Przybylski,If Zuma doesn't want to present his side of the story then that's fine. It's not like any of us expect him to tell the truth anyway. Zuma doesn't know what 'integrity' means. He wants a recusal of journalists and analysts? Zuma is frightened? Is Zuma a delicate little boy that gets frightened by the comments of a judge? Get to the comments already please What is difference between 'analyst' and 'scholar'? We must not listen to analysts but must listen to scholars? Only education most of older generation got was communist propaganda. Remember Sereti commission. Zum picked that judge and its findings were set aside on review. Zuma will not be questioned today. Probably not worth wasting the time to watch this. @Vusumuzi G Khambane Yup I agree with you. Unfortunately South Africans are herded into identity politics and forget to see themselves and others as unique individuals. Zuma is not 'responsible' for anything. He is irresponsible. Distinguish between 'theory' and 'practice' of state capture. If Zuma believed they were lying he had plenty of opportunities to honestly present his side of the story. Why is he still trying to hide from the commission? Is this how an honest man behaves? So the commission's investigation teams must be recused? Legal blackmail. "@Nqobizitha Khumalo Yes we are mostly biased against Zuma because we have been waiting for about 15 years to hear his side of the story Investigation is of evidence not of narrative. 'Gold digger' is a hypothetical straw man argument. When did 'Zondo' say she's a gold digger. Is Zuma a little child and be intimidated by a judge as mild as Zondo? Was he equally intimidated by Guptas and Putin? They want Sereti to be the new chair? Zuma is such a coward who is too scared to talk if people are 'insensitive'? How can somebody who was in Umkonto We Sizwe be so scared of a mild judge?
Zachra Petersen,This is going to be like New Years Eve 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Curfew oooooooh she is there to help him say what BIGGGGG amounts was given Zondo has a child with Zuma Sis inlaw
Antoinette Meyer,i have no sound ohhh not 10h00 yet tsk silly meüôÑ "you wanted your day in court since the arms scandal üóùÔ∏èsolution call the race card. stupid brather poor gymnastics no you want to bamboozle the citizens of this country is he threatening stalemate
Elvis Malakoane,they said he must here so that after the application they get down to business of business "ALTA nooit my skat SanFran Arnold Goodmorning to you madam is that his daughter or the interpreter "I have never invited him to my house or attended his house SanFran Arnold are you listening to the subtle sarcasm matter closed and application dismissed Can we proceed please buffering people Zondo threw their argument under the bus he does not know what to say SARCASM INTENDED HERE PUN INTENDED Adv is busy with conspiracy theories and boring victimhood "THIS IS CHILDISH STUPID CLAP TRAP
Goran Djocik,lol @ Mokoena who is the lady with Zuma Zuma is playing with fire our Judge Zondo is going to give him a peace of his mind expect what you doing there
JOHANNES MOSELANYANA,"Durr "Bliquy  "Mokoena "Bliquy "mabath
Zola Zimase,I'm getting my popcorn ready. "Sikhakhane is raising valid points of argument; but the DCJ is equal to the task Pretorius will also be able tocounter these arguements I think I'm lost. What is this lawyer saying. He seems to be agreeing with DCJ. When is the verdict expected on this? But the sick note was full of errors
Heather Durr,Zondo is in the house Maybe Kate and Hofmeyer will act as juniors to support Pretorius @pilachard Have you ever met Kate Hofmeyer. She is my choice in every aspect of legal practice Why dont they have Kate as the junior counsel @cassim suleman I know-but seniors need juniors. She is a junior counsel although she is such a superb counsel. Hope she is in the background for something so big This statement has the hand of senior counsel all over it Time to block all the Zuma Praise singers @SanFran Arnold Hi Ha ha the former ptesident The same village-really... #Seleka is way better than this guy Whataaaaaaaaaat Is Zondo falling for this cr*p DCJ tell him to sit down What is so special about this guy Ummm I am totally underwhelmed by this rambling fool wasting our time Is Pretorius still awake I am looking for a thread of logic that has been lost............................... ''When even I'-who the f do you think you are "@chimbuzi1 Yes Where is Gugu Myeni when you need her "Quote Socrates DCJ looks confused-so am I Stop citing hearsay as fact you fool-it is irrelevant. Everything YOU say is itself BIASED TEA TIME IS THE TEST @chimbuzi1 If he recuses himself he will give reasons why and then it will be quoted as precedent Dont worry Pretorius has already read it Clever clever clever tactic 100% @Mthuthuzeli Ntlanyana Please DCJ is schooling the child This Advocate even makes me miss Kennedy DCJ will have to adjourn to make his decision-so expect to wait till tomorrow although he already knows he is going to say no Do it cummon implicate yourself Cummonnnn 'intellectually' Point 1 Strike Out BOOM They send affidavits -whats to cross examine I told you about the doctors affidavits @Rene Ngwenya Yes he is a lying patronising skunk-but DCJ can see this Now he is scraping the barrel 'smokescreening' Thats Zuma's fing view-DGAF This lawyer risks a lot by giving his personal feelings as evidence-what crap Let him ask Vetkoek how she was treated How pathetic nef nef nef nef now you crossed the line Let him claim the right to remain silent-I dare you We have come full circle-self reflection aagain Kate must be dying to rush in there OH I get it he must be recused because he is too vain jy Lieg This idiot dares to place himself on the same intellectual level as DCJ Then any judge would have the same view The race card is nauseating-says everything about this man You are going to teach Mr Pretorius -he is out of your league @Goat - lets see how blackmail works because he is an average lawyer So we know-find for us or else we go on review DCJ- He will reject the request and get taken on review
Mpho Khoza,Chief Justice Just arrived wow the lady there at the back black skirt
Tay,Zuma has arrived at the Commission come to the podium JZ There is going to be a FIGHT here Meeting one on one at Forest Hotel Zuma and DCJ had a cordial one but not friends Zuma claims to be friend to the DCJ No sharing of private meals with Zuma "DCJ is very clever This recusal matter will end up in Supreme Court Sikhakhane claims that he herded cattle with DCJ Sikhakhane will realise that DCJ is the fairest of all Sound Sound Sound SIKHAKHANE "This is a tough one for the DCJ. Otherwise SIKHAKHANE is on fire Commentists SIKHAKHANE is questioning the legality of the Commission Comments that frighten Zuma? Bias.... ZUMA Team has a grand scale plan to destroy the credibility of the Commission. They did their homework and they are confident they will succeed. Orange overall needed No one sensible is being pursued by Sikhakhane Adv Sikhakhane is arguing that the Commission cannot be chaired a by human being so as to avoid bias! tea break Super Judge this one! Ubaba is not well Nonintellectual way?

Moonchild,JZ should recuse himself - into prison!! Must be either another wife or girlfriend - a daughter of his cadre perhaps? DCJ won't recuse himself & then they will take it to court! An absolute farce & another delay tactic of JZ's. Absolutely shocking that he keeps on getting away with it! @Akhona Winisi - are you being facetious? He looted & stole from the state coffers on a epic scale thereby ensuring that ALL South Africans got poorer! Adv Pretorius is brilliant & will lead very effectively! This is going to be tough for DCJ & I feel very bad for him. He doesn't deserve this from this corrupt criminal! We all support you @DCJ - #JZmustfall "DCJ has played fair & unbiased from the word go. He is an utter gentleman & has been respectful towards each witness "Ah Firing lawyers is also a delay tactic for Zuma "Zuma has been tap-dancing for the last 15 years to prevent going to court to ""have his say"". What a joke!" "State Capture started with the Arms Deal & then continued & just got worse with Zuma's presidency. Him & his ANC cadres in the patronage network got drunk on money Mantshe was an absolute disgrace & the corruption runs so deep! Ex-lawyer for Zuma says it all!! Play the race card now! Hope DCJ pulls him up on that. Why must they always play the race card!!

Adv Sk is a lawyer and is committed to doing his job If there wa s no summon he was never going to show up He is slowly nudging them back to the business of the day.

Nandi Mntambo,Zuma's daughter notyuor chomie neh
Dan Brown,I can't believe it? He's actually there. There must a catch. He is going to plead the 5th all day or something. "If he has been judged in the Press or public opinion "JGZ and TRUMP both have the same thing in common "Zuma will never go to Prison "This is the ""Let's waste a whole days time"" defense. Next will be pleased the 5th." Zuma has a different version to the Colour of the Sky Zuma has a photographic memory - He forgets things in a flash. Why did Zuma approve this commission if he didn't believe in it? Because he thought he wouldn't get caught. We would get the GUPTAS if they had the balls to show up. This is like watching Paint dry... YAWN NOT THE FAT CAKES AGAIN !!!! "Insensitive to Zuma This Lawyer is using the Stockholm syndrome on all of us now. "All this talk of blowing people
Wally,"If I was selling üçø &ü•§ today to the viewers  Zuma's argument will be along the lines of the DCJ jad a relationship with one of my wives sister many years ago before Zuma even met his wife ... DCJ already pre-empted Zuma's strategy LOL Zuma has met his match Stalingrad Strategy - This is a strategy of wearing down the plaintiff by tenaciously fighting anything the plaintiff presents by whatever means possible and appealing every unfavourable ruling . LOL He has been running for a decade This application wont succeed Classic Stalingrad tactics from Zuma lol Kemp J Kemp taught him well Zuma acts like a man who has done nothing . This idiot wrote a report that said the SARS rogue unit was illegally formed which has since turned out to be wrong The Black Elite have betrayed the ordinary Black man on the street . We are not a modern society LOL This lawyer is talking alot but saying very little Delay tactics man lol What about Zuma's history ? What about the cases which prove he was dirty ? He is not a person with no clouds over his head please man ... LOL Look at that madala sitting there looking like a TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLE ! My learned friends this is all just MEANDOS MEANDOS High level MEANDOS this This pseudo intellectual keeps revealing his general views . What a dunce This guy cannot help himself to reveal his own biases LOL Ok muting this circus now. "Education is a real problem in SA . That is why you have people who live in shacks with little to no prospects of a decent future  Zuma should have sued the folk who accuses of lying for libel ? Simple ? Ace threatened to sue Pieter Louis Myburgh. He is still waiting to this day to be sued LOL These fakes smiles and fake laughing is annoying but revealing . This sounds like Zuma wanted special treatment ...he got the same treatment as everyone else This guy is waffling now LOL he is not going to win as his argument holds little to no merit Ofcourse it's the Starlingrad Strategy Zondo does not suffer fools lightly This buffoon is wasting the commission's time LOL his claims of a conspiracy is so typical Zuma LOL
Michael Holmes,She even laughs in corruption like her father Zuma Isn't this the guy that made that terrible SARS report? sound Lol your psyche "this is not a court of law Zuma and this lawyer look similar with their brains
Johannes Makuwa,who's this lady..?

Rebbaca Bleck,Yellow is chatting and laughing nicely with a criminal Nobody takes anything seriously in this country. And we wonder why we get embarrassed like with Bushiri I will disrespect whoever I want. Fusek Zuma is not my senior or superior. I see him like any other criminal that steals a phone or whatever Don‚Äôt respect criminals And don‚Äôt laugh and chat with criminals. Zuma must be dealt with Zuma must leave this commission in handcuffs Let‚Äôs be honest Malema is the new Hitler
mahlatse matji,i what are they discussing eff
Sekgololo Johannes,We r witnessing Stalingrad in motion here. This will be a delay after a delay with court proceedings; filing court papers on the last day(s). JZ's M.O is known. Pretorious will take this The DCJ is in the mood "SC Sikhakhane must stop this ""President Zuma"" Sikhakhane SC is a ticket to jail Zuma better pack his bags; head to Dubai; or JAIL Zuma will not get his way He cud have asked for the recusal from day one It is all delay delay delay Here comes the disrespect We are going to hear Political Jabs today; not legal issues SC Sikhakhane is not a proper legal eagle Sikhakhane SC is flip flopping Sikhakhane SC shud abandon this case. He is very nervous deal with facts Sikhakhane SC Sikhakhane SC is trying too much...He will really mess this up. "if Zuma fears that apprehension of being labelled corrupt Now i see Sikhakhane is rigmaroling Sound Sound where is the sound What Bosasa Corruption? People are bleeding shame Sikhakhane SC is the master in rigmaroling blabbering always throwing things all over the place no structure nor focus @Mzalwane Mzala 100% right Zuma's camp is too disrespectful to the constitution.There is only one president @ a time "for now Sikhakhane stick tot he law. U failed with ya political theory on STATE in the Bosasa Matter. Stick to the law Sikhakhane will have to go into other fields cuz on the legal field he has no chance Sikhakhane is struggling shame "So if all of us are bias Sikhakhane is blowing hot air @chimbuzi1 I ask myself the same' "he always starts with fire Now u r going to tell the DCJ how to express himself? @Mzalwane Mzala correct. He is just lost shame If you want to go to jail call on Sikhakhane SC to represent you. How much time does this guy have? yeses very boring maan "Sikhakhane SC just stop it. Leave political theory alone Sikhakhane stop it please. Sikhakhane SC is making emotional pleas "@Esme Van Heerden 100% U have wasted enough time already "@Carmen James u forgot to mention ""the overrated Mpofu SC""" @Yolo More heheheheh Carl is just one clown Sikhakhane SC sit down. U really started will but now u r blowing hot air The DCJ is always careful when he speaks. Always The DCJ stands firm. Sikhakhane SC and co better prepare to file papers somewhere else. I really do not understand why Zuma filed this application. Unless the aim to go stalingrad on steroids I need Adv Kate Hofmeyr here I agree with Sikhakhane SC: the US is the most captured state in the world. Is the problem the DCJ or the commission on its own? "knew it Sikhakhane SC lost his mind Conspiracy "Ohh wow now we r in the spy games? no man Sikhakhane SC shud never allow himself to go this low We r still waiting for REAL POINTS here. Sikhakhane SC has not made any The Commission's investigators cannot be investigating conspiracy theories we r here for fraud and corruption. Sikhakhane SC is on that political-intelligence nonsense "Zuma tried to say Hanekom was a spy It is disrespect Today we hear the commission shud investigate Zuma's daydreamings? Nonsense blackmail blackmail Sikhakhane nooo man hehehehehe Sikhakhane SC is now in the mud Yeses Sikhakhane SC is still here Can Sikhakhane SC stick to the legal points He shud stop throwing conspiracy theories around Sikhakhane SC is now abusing the court with his conspiracies I have not heard any real point for recusal what really was in those 100 pages? uBaba is very sensitive No recusal shud be granted Now we r in that racist territory? Finally he finished "Sikhakhane SC made only political points

Phillip Cwazibe,"4 Fact: The Commission or the Judge listened to evidence brought by those 34 who testified. In some ways Mr. Zuma was implicated. It is the evidence gathered that Mr. Zuma must refute. @ABRAHAM MALULEKE It is a steep mountain Sir. We are here to ask for the judge to listen to our version and disregard the evidence given. DCJ is being drawn into party divisions. Please do not ask difficult question nor make comments my client will misconstrue. @Allan Budge ‚Äã The judge must now not ask difficult questions and treat my client with silk gloves.

Sibusiso Kubeka,want to hear scArf Skhakhane and how the head of arguments will be delivered SC Adv.Skhakhane one of my favourite strategic advocate in this boy try all law fundis and law students lecture coming if DCJ finds against Mr Zuma. a door has been openned for the reviewal of his decision. my take is that if there was a drawn perception of impartiality and it's case made clearly. the appeal/review of the findings is coming. SC Adv.Skhakhane is setting out the platform of unfairness as he will at some point show to the DCJ and mostly creating public perception of bias ala Trump argument of influencing public perception inferences and influences. by touching on matters but divert from as part of argument the Concourt would engage for clarity even ask questions for clarity it happens in the concourt. meaning by SC.. Adv Skhakhane the chiefs judges of the concourt should keep to themselves and come up Now ukuduba seems to be wrong. a middle ground is asked demanded by not actually wished it argued for if the DCJ Had met Mr Zuma's doctors. would the question been raised as was done in the KZN high court of doctor client privilege we are waiting for the review and that if Zuma is dragged into the commision. the right not to incriminate self will apply. cordial aggression at play by SC Adv Skhakhane passive aggresion telling the could I argue that SC Adv. wants to suggest as to how the DCJ should run the commision now going with what might be argued as frivolous wanting to going what the man on the street would never connect if this man SC Adv. Skhakhane had at the start would have never come to what he had concluded the average man would never have come to any of his conclusive implications "I am becoming more than slowly disappointed by SC Adv. Skhakhane' s arguments from what I would have expected from him. maybe it's about the ""connect"" the dot person Fordham seems to be at the centre" "the ""call"" that has been made to all its not only perceptions it's actually baseless. With no substantiveness DCJ would have never meant president. but it's been said the presidents at many instances" they will review the judgement in courtafter the decision of no recusalwhich they will get. the review will be on the eyes of the public any inclination is never an intention the witness could or not have been drawn to a particular suggestion this to draw pieces of what was said and put of context for me it some stick This is not only about the commision any more it's about the chair and his intention to the eyes of the public. SCH is on trial here. how he becomes a man on the street is on him arguing the content of the case and recusal is being conflated
Neo Kekana,Kate is not here.....
Chris Mbangi,NDINEMINCILI!!!!
Sherwin Peters,Chair is ready for these people today umholozi is going down here I don't think any advocate in this country can challenge the DCK on aspects of law DCJ "Wemame aah is uBaba frightened Ms Mbanjwa must be so proud "basically @ALTA GM Adv Pretorius is itching to have a go any law students watching this How to stall the metaphors ü§£ü§£ü§£ "has anyone heard a valid reason yet this is a fool proposition but Zondo doesn't put propositions to witness for unless he needs to and states so sounds like a White House staffer

Now he is just wasting Zuma's time for his invoice He still need to tell us what he did in relation to SC
Alhadiah Khan,Zuma asked for the commission and approved mr Zondo surprised why he is asking for requisal very surprising this lawyer is asking for requital becos of media perception. how does he judge the decision of other judges. why dont let the hearing and then appeal

Gitsa Mpofu,"What is Zuma's interpretation of ""friend""? It seems like it's very very vague." """You are my friend...."" 'I'm not your friend.' 'YOU ARE MY FRIEND...' 'I am not your friend...' ""YOU ARE MY FRIEND MAAAAAN COME ON!!!!!!""" The EX of my dead wife's sister is my friendü§≠ (yisizulu leso) "If Zondo is Zuma's friend "If lawyers have the truth They want Zondo to be reasonable. They want an idiot to chair the commission... They want a Mkhwebane or a Kwinana HUH? He is simply accusing Zondo of bias. He is implying that Zuma will never get fair and unbiased treatment because human nature is prone to bias. Skhakhane is biased to think that people are biased They want to use such things as Zondo's disbelief of Kwinana finding not wrong with being wined and dined in Chicago. "If the witnesses are spilling their guts out The wants Zondo to tell him to stop talking so that he can say that Zondo is bias. He is going to test Zondo's composure. Even calling for a tea break now would look like bias... We are being held hostage at 'bias' point... We are not having tea out of fear of being called bias. "@Kholiswa Nyamazana if you shut him up He argued for 40 minutes and his argument was thwarted in 3 minutes. "The right hand does not know what the right hand is doing. Oh boy "This is boring now. The strategy here is to convolute the masses since the trial is in the public domain I Zuma said Zondo was his friend now there is bias. I like how he says that... 'its extracted from the witness by the chair.' The chair was extracting things. This lawyer is not worth his salt. His arguments are devoid of grit. He is insulting the judiciary as we know it. The entire judiciary is being insulted right now and it's not amusing. @T Sayer I think he doubles on Newsmax as well. I now get why most wealthy people shy away from from black lawyers. This is actually making him and Zuma look bad. I don't see any victory here except maybe in the court of public opinion. Should Zondo nurse Zuma's ego and insecurities? Here we go again.... ALL STATES ARE CAPTURED. Gold digger is irrelevant much like all of the lawyer's arguments The music is freaking Zuma out.ü§£ü§£ The building itself spooks Mr Zuma. He sees state capture commission as a slaughter house built for him. A criminal would be inclined to feel the same way about any court. These guys are somehow reading our comments and using them A BROTHER!!!!?????? It is about feelings. The client is very sensitive for an innocent man. "He is really out to discredit Zondo. Now because Zondo is his village boy
Moleti Moseki,THEY NOT FRIENDS HE IS SWEATING ALREADY When they were stealing they were not digging deep in their humanities...to see how their stealing will affect the nation Savage....i am hearing the same thing Am angry.....South Africa is angry.

That is Ramaphosa @Sekgololo Johannes Truth be told! @Pastor J.J Those of us who believe in free speech will not block them @Lindokuhle Hadebe He has committed himself to appearing when the commission closes. I am not an EFF member but I appreciate that there is nothing offensive in expressing support for the EFF or any party in post-apartheid South Africa @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee Hahaha @Anne M. We debate and disprove distortions without closing space for those who differ with us. @Sekgololo Johannes There are no legal arguments available to argue his case and now he must run around and obfuscate. Zondo's opening statement took the air out of Zuma's application. I agree with the Rosa Luxemburg quote @Bongumenzi Nxumalo Skhakhane and Matshiqi seem to have a long history of comradeship from their university days.

Francoise Phillips,The country stand with you Zondo. "Zuma is so shilny Zuma's lawyer is so arrogant to think he can explain the law to our Deputy Chief Justice. "This advocate is much like Malusi Gigaba This advocate is an insult to the superbly intelligent and sharp black lawyers we have in our country. Where was Zuma's humanity when he bussed his followers in to toi=toi outside court for Kwezi's rape case? Zondo is bored to death with this incongruent verbal diarea. "Zuma was seen to be immoral "The man who built himself a swimming pool When our Judge Zondo is not trying to stay awake he is trying hard not to burst out laughing at this advocates pathetic non argument. "Zuma with his big gold watch given to him by the Guptas Zuma's advocate is a snake oil salesmen wasting the country's time and money. Sikhakhane is simply trying to use as much of the commission's time as he possibly can. Insulting to every South African. Let us never forget that is the ANC that made this crook and cheat called Zuma president of out country and they happily watched as he destroyed our economy. Only a guilty man fights os hard to avoid facing justice. The nonsensical legal gymnastics of a guilty man trying to avoid accountabiity for his sins. EFF is the ANC's military wing.

"@ Austin Van Rensburg What precisely has that to do with (a) my comment that you're copy & pasting or (b) with the topic of the day which is Zuma's hearing Zondo is preparing him for the outcome!! @ Reece petersen Fully agree! Nothing must interfere with Zondo's tea LOL He was doing quite well until he started talking nonsense? Now he says the commission is politically driven? Zondo is already giving him his recusal decision in bits and pieces He still has to explain why his client delayed things until the last minute. Now is he threatening? This threat is going to blow up in his face! He may choose not to participate it won't change the fact that the SIU; Hawks; SARS etc will still be investigating him Now he says Zondo cannot self analyse? @ Michelle Yes he's trying to tell Zondo how biased he is @ Sam. Zondo is allowing him to talk himself out of the argument. Surely he misses the point that Zondo was respectful and polite to virtually all witnesses? The last thing Zondo must do is to justify himself to this lawyer The only thing that impresses me about Sekhakhane is that he has spoken for TWO hours not from notes! He's misswing the point Zondo made @ Molongwana PRECISELY Or tell her daughter her vetkoek is not nice? Has this nation moved from Kentucky to coekies? Precisely Zuma has a long record of trying to avoid his day in court/commission Oops the racist comment\ He will only be criticized by the guilty Now he wants to be part of the commission? Go ahead and do that. Zondo will then only report based on those who pitched uop

Banele Masuku,After 20 minutes Skhakhane is basically saying Zondo is bias because he gets 'emotional' during the testimonies @Sherwin Peters ‚úã Skhakhane said Bias is a state of mind. Meaning as long as Zuma thinks Zondo is bias he is bias. This on its own invalidates the application @Carmen James YES. thats why one american journalist once said this commission will destroy democracy Zuma had 783 counts against him and you still voted for him to be president.

"he we go again State capture is a type of systemic political corruption in which private interests significantly influence a state's decision-making processes to their own advantage "It is not a theory They were all ANC They were no selection. Witnesses came on their own difficult time because of Zuma not cooperating So now he given reason for Zuma to testify I do not dislike Zuma the person. Just dislike the lootings that occured on his watch. "This advocate I disagree that the DCJ put proposition to people. All judges ask questions to witnesses. "I will not use the word ""improper"" is a way to try to muddle the subject."

Malema is still waiting for his A4 and paragraph Grandmother made tea and vetkoeks.What a great story from a lawyer in South Africa This one must tell us about Bushiri his face says he knows
Piet Vast,ANC : Chief Zuma is an honest righteous man. Corruption is a white thing. ANC = corruption ANC : Intellectual accusing an ANC chief is not possible ANC = corruption ANC : 'the struggle' must be paid for till the end of times ANC = SAL on the ground with broken wings ANC : death and destruction ANC = politcal prisoners ANC : accuse the judge ANC = fake struggle ANC = ANCYL with empty pockets ANC = Law of the jungle ANC = Faction murders ANC = child abuse ANC = BOXER to the slaughterhouse ANC = White lawyer is guilty ANC = Chasing Thuli Madonsela ANC = Where is my new BMW 7 ? ANC = Rand 15 for a $ ANC = Corruption ANC = massmurder ANC = Chris Hani must be 'removed' ANC = Judge guilty ANC = EFF ANC = where is the 20 yo whiskey ANC : Zuma 115+ ANC = mama Winnie 'educated' Stompie ANC = Boers are not being killed in SA ANC = 'normal crime' ANC = 'normal corruption'

Molekoane Ranyaoa,"Any state capture is undesirable . Two wrongs not equating to a right. The legal counsel fails to convince. Empirical evidence is queried here So all along the so-called Zuma bravery was just engaged in chest beating bravado signifying nothing. We live in a constitutional democracy and not a feudal state- egalitarianism at the core.
mmbudzeni mapholi,Cookies again
Mponeng Joe,the cult is circling around ZumA and he is always quilty as per their oath. if the recusal is denied. my President will just get ill then.
