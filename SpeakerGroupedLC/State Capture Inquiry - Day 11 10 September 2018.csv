Paul molane,when they said 10am they meant 11am yes kodwa is always there the comission can only refer the report to NPA The cases were investigated abd reffered to NPA which has to decide to prosecute or not. lawyers are not accountants as much as accountants are not lawyers lol fils she is cute fils are you eating fat cakes for lunch?

Dominique Mudawini,any problem with that?
Norman Zwane,@Modimokoane Brendeline Sorry someone's heavy breathing annoys you. @samuel molope From a commission? I thought only courts have that authority. @Ken Mojela Yep! It is him. Great spotting. @Paul molane That is what I've always thought. Which is why a joker like Shaun Abrahams suited Zuma like a glove. "@Cool Jazz By appointing the likes of Shaun @Paul molane I am convinced all lawyers are the devils' advocates "@Fils de l'homme You quite observant  @Fils de l'homme I think you are race baiting Fils.

How much is this commission going to cost us. I heard the venue is costing us R21k/day. More than 6 million a year just for venue "@Craig..Can we at least be hopeful for the best? Maybe this commission will bring more hope Guptas received R 6 000 000 000.00 through China Rail locomotives deal. Tom Moyane then gives them unlawful tax kickback amounting to millions. I can't believe so much money went to 2 stupid brothers @David - Our ex President is a moron of them all "This money could have built all urgently needed school in S.A Nomvula Mokonyane is one of the corrupt elements. R2.6 Billion wal "R.2.6 Billion vanished from the country's purse via Giyani Water project "Zuma was protected 9 x in parliament not to step down. now they blame him for the current economic crunch. But they defended him FS - Hello Ace.. How can you explain this mess?? Unity through silver bullets.. It's not going to wokr "Ace is certainly going to be summoned to come here "He must come and testify "still have Gigaba and Bathabile All DGs and CFOs of all departments must come and testify. "They (DGs and CFOs) are the ones who need his to this point "Moyane is a joke "Cyril must reshuffle now "@Mokoena - Numbers will humble you "I hope Manyi has bought new shoes this time. Cyril was there all the time "if Cyril was serious about corruption during Zuma administration Eish..I guess you are right Are we going to hear the judge handing the judgement for the Guptas and Associates? But he could have at least make noise about it than to keep quiet "Ahg..Is he not done with the judgement R21000 for today is gone Agree with Nkabinde "EEF will do better come 2019 100 weeks I guess I've blocked him we need at least 2 witnesses per day. one is not enough

Nelson Musoliwa,So far some ANC leaders implicated on corruption but not on behalf of the ANC at least for now. Payments to Infinity and TNA an the manner of it is shocking. Will be interesting when Manyi testify about even payments to Gupta companies from GCIS when he was there as DG. People must pay serious attention to this please People like Zuma were looting the state in the name of ANC but not for ANC so the ANC is indeed not on trial here so far till evidence come forward that ANC sanctioned those activities
Refiloe Nkabinde,Mokoena best answer ever we want to know the amounts we don't have script Juju went to Thuli for the what now. Mbalula knew and did nothing @david also think that so Zupta media is actually government asset we still don't know DA sponsors so ANC cannot suspend people because they were voted in but we are not a constituency democracy?

Nokwazi Shongwe,"Vote ANC Forget about Criminals everybody is corrupt as we speak people are stealing from the public wallet.

Serepa Le Mabona,Don’t worry about the cost already Bosasa is ready to return R154 or so millions. So the commission will be paid out of looted money. Those who are doing their best to paint ANC are merely politicking. The process is pointing to corrupt elements who were masquerading as ANC and will help to cleanse rather than condemn it. Can you also say CR is responsible and complicit in the meeting that Ace held with Zuma because CR is in the same leadership with Ace? Forget about ANC losing elections because it won’t happen in your lifetime. You think by acknowledging the plunder by some people in the ANC transfers our trust to DA or EFF? Molo Fish!!
