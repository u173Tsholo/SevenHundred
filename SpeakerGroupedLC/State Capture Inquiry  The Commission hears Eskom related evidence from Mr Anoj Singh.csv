Sal SA,@Umar Singh. So why was Anoj struck off as a CA. @Teunis Hello hope u well @ALTA GM hope u well @Ismail Petersen. Salaams hope u well. Bo Kaap is one of my favorite places. Love the Jazz festivals n the food is great Ready for take off. Fasten your belts😂 Totally useless. What time will DCJ resume? "i hope DCJ continues with testimony by Singh "@Market Place. Zondo is dealing with state capture DCJ reading Singhs affidavit "@Market Place. I'm not a legal person "@Market Place. Yes it must be frustrating Don't allow any more time DCJ Its Singh's problem - he needs to learn a lesson. Must give evidence today Where is Singh? Great Who is this nutcase? Name? "No Total incompetence- let's stop this charade DCJ DCJ will allow this nonsense Legal team slipped up big time Then why didn't they refill a correct summons If there was an affidavit DCJ could have proceeded @Khustaz yes now DCJ is obliged to postpone @Cass8m Suleman. Agreed Bye guys Anoj Singh was fortunate n DCJ is credible
FieliesSA,O we know if Anoj was ruled a delinquent director? I know he was stripped of his SAICA membership... Do It could be that Singh and or his directors have not arrived yet... Woohoo here we go! Coffee ready! Snacks ready! Boss not present! Go! Talk about R billions like I talk about R100's... @Quinton van Eeden like he did at the parliamentary enquiry into ESKOM. I remember Pravin was brutal @Theo Maluleke yes but hismembership with SAICA was stripped. @fuzile dazana 🤣🤣🤣 Tell them Zondo! Hopefully during tea breaks Zondo and the EL will go through the Affiadvid This was deliberate... Shame on them @Adrian Fray I think Zondo was clear that Anoj will be answering  "Zondo @Sal SA Technically not. He has not walkedout yet 😀 "@Peter Prentice All these prominent figures like white laywers(Malema He has known for 6 months but still un prepared... @Will I can see them too! Well he said he is far from being persuaded... Its past 11! Stop this now Zondo will postpone due to a technicality from his own team 😞 😞 Everyone now running to double check their summons for faults...
Sam Matladi,tell the truth and safe the country we are all waiting
Thandekile Sigwela,at what time is singh appearing before Zondo gud people?
nhlanhla nkosi,I so wish mrs kate hofmeyr is the one to question this guy
Lerato Moleke,eNCA also not streaming yet Heya lady Diane I wonder who's going to lead Cyril's evidence - the day he takes the hot seat Heya @Valencia DCJ can also be a Mbanjwa sometimes yazi @Anne - 😅😆 was also looking at the big 5 on his tie "Did I hear ""not able to give evidence today"" ??" @Market P - did you Cc the PP Hallelujah DCJ - T this is blatant disregard for taxpayers  "Tsek So should we expect the same drama from Brian - after he's been publicly saying that he's not being given a chance to have his say  So everyone is gonna use Seleka as a SCAPEGOAT - really? Yaas DCJ - unleash beast mode please  "Yeah "Eish Adv Seleka and his team Let me check Moses Twitter timeline - he's probably having a mimosa  "Seleka must just go cry his eyes out "I hope Seleka has a supportive wife @Earl Breezy 😂💦
Diane Louw,gosh its 36 degrees here today - cant take much more of this heat. so what is happening here "gm Alta Cape Town morning Sal SA Op la die op la da Happy birthday Heather!!

Dembe Doyoyo,what's happening
Heather Durr,I am sure Singh will not appear in person-has he not skipped to Dubai yet @Diane Louw Hi there I have a crush on Anoj @Diane Louw She is Bushiri's attorney "@Thulani Bukani Hi there  His lawyer is too busy representing people who skip bail @Valencia J Hi there She will confuse DCJ  Ms Mbanjwas Step Sister Here we go ........ Tell DCJ you have been busy with Bushiri DCJ is not impressed This is truly unacceptable-I wonder if DCJ can force him to testify on what they have. Seleka is ready @Pastor J.J Awwwww Thank you @Diane Louw is that for me? I trust DCJ comes back with a view already formed-that lady from yesterday could have come back today In fact Koko could have spent the whole day there-his lawyer could have adjusted his plans She looked better at the Bushiri hearing-maybe this lighting does not agree with her She does look like Cruella.  Singh is there @Sal SA Bushiri's lawyer DCJ knows that they are taking a technical point and furious that they are getting away with it DCJ let him talk it is a pathetic legal point taken by disreputable lawyers which is why Singh uses her. No self respecting counsel would raise that point
Sarah Hayz,Can I also come Ismail? Sounds Divine! Thast not a problem Ismail
Kgotso Mpete,"hi everybody where is Advocate Hofmeyer? they are now undermining the commission "Chairperson Mr Seleka is making us to lose now eishh

Mr300millz,"This just in  The Slippery Anoj Singh-Star "Anoj ""Tell all document"" Singh 🤣🤣🤣"
Gina deW,@Ismail Petersen So 'n bek moet jam kry 🙂 A whole day cooking and gone in a wink. Lekker verby @Ismail Petersen The only racecard is for Kenilworth Jirre patat - this is Bushiri's council - she is a lunatic
Gray Lawrence,we need someone to start singing
Martha Sello,is DCJ negotiating the postponement with Anoj? there we go @Fuzile I really like they way he dealt with Mzwanele Manye another Gupta crook is this the Bushiri lawyer? @Rohan thanks don't let them off the hook DCJ wasting commission's time when CC handing down the Judgement to compel Zuma to appear and answer questions at Zondo commission? @Nkululeko his there sit down let's start with the business of the day she wants to assist Anoj to skip the country with delaying tactics yes DCJ she's on steroids Adv Seleka you messed up no excuses so Molefe is watching and will also play the same game zondo you must do night shift for Anoj next week Adv Seleka is human Seleka is going no where just like Zuma and the Guptas milked our country
Lorna Kavanagh,ms K ... Zuma will not give any intelligent answers ... and he knows his role in all of this. This is unacceptable ... the commission has limited time. Oh dear ....
Thulani Bukani,Happy birthday Heather  Hello to all South Africans  is the blonde lady Mbanjwas sister? 😂🤣 Noooooo man @styx ndlovo 😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣 Is Singh even there?  Terrible.

Rudi Haywood,Hello folks  Popcorn ready  Hello Valencia J @fuzile Lol 😂  She’s working 9-5 today  Excuses  Yoh she’s rude 
Santa Kriel,morning everybody aaaahhhh Advocate Seleka easy to talk. it will be different when you yourself have to deal with all these escape artists. easy to comment. it is just so very easy to critizise people! all the other achievements are overlooked "if one has nothing to hide
Karel Kajani,The advocate is the same lady that represented Bushiri
Anne M.,Hello @Thulani Bukani  Anoj Singh @Valencia J  I like DCJ's tie @Adrian Fray Adjourned for DCJ to read an affidavit submitted a few minutes ago. I agree @Esme Van Heerden . It's been months and months that they've known he must appear at the commission.  😂😂😂😂 @R Bauer  @Rubin Naidoo Yup - a delaying tactic Rubbish! He might not be called ......? Pathetic excuse. Forgiven and forgiven 😉 @Pastor J.J  """Take it from us"" means what? That you are not trying to prevent your client from giving evidence?" @Andy I agree. Adv Seleka's team believed Singh's lawyer when they said they would submit the affidavit on the 18th.  @Siyanda Mhlongo I don't think it's incompetence. It's a matter of trusting his team and Singh's lawyers to do what is right. They didn't. Adv Seleka is neither a liar nor incompetent. A mistake was made by his team and as leader he is taking responsibility for it. Agree @Akhonamandla Gala . Adv Seleka has stepped up and taken responsibility for his team.
fuzile dazana,how are we where is arnold 6 and 9 same where is adv vincent maleka sello he would say the documents documents dolly pardon what is she doing here lol andre she a biltong she doesnt get old alta zuma tricks at play let the game bgn dolly must sit down is wasting our data with zuma tricks he is eating gupta curry in dubai bushiri wama donation this anoj guy is in dubai enjoying curry dolly must tell mr u must know something zondo it must be called state of postpoment adv seleka is making money he knows how to milk state cow  bring back maleka really now seleka

Maboko S,I doubt Mr Anoj will be different from others
Mbongeni Mapipa,why should the evidence leader be repeatedly told to speak up
Bets Fourie,"Singh will not ""incriminate"" himself - it will be a boring morning" she should have working during December holidays no evidence today Singh is not even there nope - he is not. That is why his Legal team is stalling Business is closed due to Covid He knew from August...... who was sleeping? not testifying today..... never testifies Ooooo Zondo is not happy with this Team...... Big time! :buffering: 🚽
Quinton van Eeden,i.e. Singh just tells the commission (and by extension the SA public) to go pleasure themselves @FieliesSA - another contempt charge coming up @Antoinette Meyer - yeah quite peculiar that all the de-colonisation and black excellence activists seem to prefer legal representation with a distinctly pale complexion @Market Place - maybe read the commission's terms of reference first? order a arrest warrant to be issued with bail opposed due to flight risk "@Heather Durr - yip and postponing to Monday simply enables the ""not enough time"" argument"
TheQueen V,hey 😊 who's on the stand today that lying thing @Lerato true yes chair chair no special nothings. they are trying to delay impossible? no madam. you are wasting precious time this people can waste time thjo yes chair don't give alot of airtime. scroll over it and say no @Lerato correct.

Jerry Lamola,Is she the lawyer for Bushiri?
VigoSun,She's not getting it. Her client made a 3 year long mistake. it's done now let's proceed. @ALTA lol Zondo is a gummy bear. too PG for my liking. Zuma still thinks he stole R10... Selena is smoking again. Technicalities can make you look incompetent. Another postponement it seems..Zondo banking on the side. Are we on another leon Schuster movie cause seleka's high expectations are just a turn off Who likes to boogey? I prefer tap dancing.
