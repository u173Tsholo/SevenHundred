Gray Lawrence,"Monday "I'd give her both Goodmorning Heather and Alta😃 "thx Heather "Wolfgang 👍 Alta 😃👍
Blake Yogi,"@Joshua are you a lawyer? Cos I heard a lawyer on youtube being interviewed by the media saying that it is either a fine I always knew Zweli was not so holy and innocent since Sodi mentioned him he bana Chair and then? The ruling ? @Roxxi I love how he says Issue 🤣🤣🤣🤣 is you "we need to deal with the ""Is You"" of" @Roxxi she is the best but this guy is on his own path and finding out whats happening. he has his own Is yous🤣🤣🤣 Why is this witness speaking in stuppel lyne?? @Zach dont worry about Myeni. Dhe burried herself for all the times she didnt answer. Im more concerned about the charge for Mr X Guys I have not followed the Denel stream at all. Is it fire? Kyk vi De klerk jnr @Roxxi I thought it would be addressed before the proceedings continue. guess not @Yolo but there is evidence of ish happening there? @Valencia J 🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Roxxi boring? How many millions/billions stolen make it boring? @Valencia I agree. not all of these streams are sensational or have intense evidence leaders. Its about the info 🤯🤯 what did you do with the hard copy why are people wanting sensation instead of the truth??? The commission has become some of yal soapies. Go watch Days Of Ou Lives or something @SanFran saying the evidence leader is boring as if he is here to entertain yal. He is a lawyer. Not a dancer @Sandile that would be amazing These evidence leaders are soo brilliant. They arent all exciting or entertaining but they nail corruption hunet pershent 100% These witnesses are very intelligent. they have masters in crookery. But when they come here they act dumb so that it looks impossible for them to devise these elaborate schemes "He is already his own light @Anne look at Kwinana. she is pretending she doesnt know how it all happened. Yet she was central to it. Using language as an excuse. She knows exactly what is what and what should have been 🤯🤯🤯🤯 Innocent Xhosa person? so the others are guilty? He bana🤯🤯🤯 "Mr Kennedy Mr ""Is Yous""" @Phaka go back to the replays. We are ok here DL? 🙈🙉 @Phaka. no you want entertainment. we want to follow proceedings to know what is what here. @Mike maybe 🤣🤣 @Vincent where is that proof? @Reece🤣🤣🤣 I call her A-Kate47 @Lee wow for the what? the tarentals? what is this man saying? Dont underestimate Mr Kennedy. You think hy ken dit nie. He knows exactly what happened We already heard the race card. Innocent young black xhosa guy @Thepiso she is involved in aviation stream. Not Denel He seems calm though. Myburgh shouts the witnesses inside and outside their glory and back @Sherwin great point 🤣🤣🤣 not great for some. Just great it was never 🤣🤣🤣 Valencia that is more accurate who is late for work in the background 16th @Louis C maybe cos they worked on Saturday 🤣 I have exams on Zumas Day 1. "I think he either wont pitch so you think he will pitch? what about the recusal application? @Simphiwe. her lawyers had until 10 to give those submission. Chair needs to consider those before ruling . Dont know if it is as simple as a quick tea break session or if he needs more time to us it is obvious. We want jailtime and hefty fine but Chair has to consider both sides I agree @Simphiwe we need to know. The suspense isnt cool @That Falla Chair told us not to it is more respect to law than scared @Weaver go to replays "@Simphiwe he will because unlike most other witnesses I agree with Mike. If possible he wont pick. His son said he was on death bed last week he told the media that @Haji amen. Mr X is Mr X Yes @Simphiwe. Mr X is Mr X. These investigators will search for Blake Yogi. Imagine I must go sit cos I also mention Mr X. I agree with Heather.🤐🤐🤐🤐 strategic supplier???🤯🤯🤯 @Simphiwe I feel SAA is ready for arrests. We have actually heard enough. 🤯🤯🤯🤯 Joshua Doore here is dodgy @Dan that is true Im actually starting to love this evidence leader now that Im following what he is saying "but yal never got to that ultimate goal @Thapelo it wont work. They will still jail him. "This new term used as defence for everything these days "" you are anti transformational"" 😶😶😶😶" melds there are 2 more witnesses. @melds 🤣🤣🤣 @Canis 🤣🤣🤣 @Dan she knows exactly what it is. She also knew what would happen if she told us she knew. thats why she denied. Dont be fooled by pretence Naledi 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ @Thapelo she only does aviation stream. Today is Denels turn @Naledi we keep getting people who are more into entertainment than allowing the proceedings to continue to other streams why not @glen. I love comments here. Some people are so smart giving great points and others are annoying just block. @R.m I was saying the same thing this morning but someone else suggested Joshua Doore and I think that is way more accurate 🤣 @R.M 🤣🤣🤣 @melds Amen exactly @melds reeks of corruption 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 "We still have the ""is you"" to sort" da is dit nou. Kom Praat Joshua Doore. Talk No @Bheki its because we dont all know what is happening here and it isnt sensational but there is a lot coming out here @Belinda Kate handles Aviation stream. this week is Denel jirrie drink die man klippies en coke No Sir. You are dodgy wodgy. Zinhle we dont need to bring them back. we have geard enough. They can go to Hawks or court. Kate has proved her points thoroughly @Prudence there are replays you can listen to Johannes @10AM not before 9 After Chair receives it he needs to go through it then rule Has Myeni been arrested? @Sipho we have heard enough lies from Ms Mokonyane

Kevin1,This is ridiculous that it has taken 45 minutes just to agree signatures A quick guess - the Commission is costing +-R150k to R200k per hour (all streams): this must also be recovered from the corrupt thieves

"Anyone want to wager Jacob Zuma will not appear at the commission "It's not ""Stalingrad defence"" anymore It the ""DUDU Defense""" All JGZ's wives daren't say anything or else they will lose their income for life. @Heather Durr​ I agree the poor guy is in enough trouble. He is the only really honest person to testify against Mrs.DUD. @Heather Durr​ probably was a Headmistress @Heather Durr​ I knew you were an intellectual @Heather Durr​ Kate probably has a 180 IQ "Personally I think everyone who has serious dirt is scared of being ""Gavin Watsonned""" Or ACED with a Sword I love the little smile that creeps in when she's about to drop a big bomb Agrizzi isn't black or any other race. I don't think Black authors would sign their name to anything for fear of reprisals and want to protect their families. "I am still chuckling about the ""Domicilium"" Gaff from a CA that went to Varsity and did articles Her Law Firm must be proud of her. I thought Domicilium was in it's most basic interpretation.

The commission will take the information lead by Adv Hofmeyr as true and correct. "Ja "Ah Now we're getting to the nitty gritty @Heather Durr Each SOE stream has a dedicated advocate. Hofmeyr does SAA and Kennedy does Denel. @Blake Yogi DCJ has already said that Zuma can zoom because of his age and health. Do we really think Zuma will sit there without a couple of lawyers (out of sight) in the corner? @Mlungisi Ntshangase Adv Kennedy Hi @Naledi Barron I think they were just checking that the witness had all the same documents as the advocate @ALTA Mine too! @Annie Van Niekerk 😆
