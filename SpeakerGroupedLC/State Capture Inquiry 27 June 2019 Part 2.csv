Peet Venter,Mahlangu is going to be in that seat for a long time if he doez not realize his pants is on fire Mahlangu is about to lose another tooth. @Jayden Bango His wisdom tooth is about to be extraced with a blunt spade! for sure. Economy is tight Leonard Save me from myself! Zondo - HAHAHAHAHAHA!! Maglangu's wisdom tooth is now hurting Get this guy a gum shield! gum guard please! @Felix Muyoba He definitely falls in the first category. @Sindiswa Moolman Agreed. Same goes for criminals who are brave enough to murder but cant be brave in court and admit their wrongdoing outright When I send an email I dont use my CEO's template. Call the Medics. His mouth is bleeding profusely! @Zeekat You missed the funniest evidence thus far. MBA degree First semester Lesson 1. Do NOT let other people sign on your behalf When Miss Hofmeyer grins like that then you must pack your suitcase and report yourself at the nearest SAPS office @TSATSI you need to break a limb. Zuma's interrogation is going to take at least 3 weeks! @Yolo More More time for him to reflect whilst serving a life sentence FSP - Financial Service Provider Oeps! Oeps!!! Daar klap nog 'n tand!

One front tooth gònè!!! eyaShaya mpundu stiff upper lip spells fear Can you guys imagine how the comments are going to fly here while Zumpalumpa testifies. chow guys

Sindiswa Moolman,This woman has a lot for Mahlangu. His lawyer didn’t prepare this guy properly. I would fire him if I were Mahlangu Buy @Jayden Bango his attorney should have taken him through possible questions based on what happened during the awarding of the tender and their involvement in those irregularities But @Jayden Bango I agree @Jayden Bango. It’s clear This man looks young. It’s clear he lacks experience on this corruption project. Hence he’s fumbling on the stand Unyanisile @Jabulile Mazwane and @funicanz No what @Jabulile Mazwane? It’s hard after the fact @Peet Venter. One needs to admit before it’s proven. I guess one has to be mature enough to know they can and can’t do. I know and agree with you all @Phillip Cwazibe @funicanz Hope the DCJ will do the same with JZ Yaaa @Abel Matshidiso And the bus is still moving on a high speed @Wilson M Yes...@Wilson M Hope he declared that his evidence may incriminate himself just as Agrizzi did. Hahahah@Thembisa Odendaal Soo young @Yolo More... I feel so bad for him. Shuuu... All the reasons to stop feeling sorry for this guy. He looted so much from our purse Hi my comrade @Keith

Kevin Simon,Sounds like the Koroneka business. Just a front. Never met the client. Never serviced the client. Through you chair. This guy dismisses dates an unimportant. It is more likely fraudulent!!!!! The modus operandi is so similar there must have been a mastermind. If I was the advocate I may find myself referring to the witness as Mr Hindsight. This is a lesson in fronting. Money for nothing. Even the terms and conditions provide no refuge... 😉 So they tried to extract a cancellation fee after the FSB suspended them. 😃 Defeating the ends of justice. Criminal charges surely. Still suspended. Did they inform SAA? Wait for it.... Sure he was evasive in his coms with SAA Now going to blame ISP mail server OH OH!!!!!! Unless there is proof. The letter he sent is at best only a rumour. "This guy has seriously lawyered up for this session. Without it this would have been a 6:0 The learnings from the Commission should become a school subject. So he doesn't have an unused email address. He simply ignores them unless he is alerted. We don't have the benefit of a 5th amendment. Oh dear! VERY MIsleading. "As tRump would say I forgot Fraud There is always a first time.... He didn't know
Cheezy Weezy,eish she is finishing this guy man only the Agrizzi style of doing things will help this one in the future but eish his looking for his lawyers assistance Nkululeko didnt u chow with this one in 2011 ? hofmeyer is a finisher @Zondo im glad brother otherwise it would have been your chance before Hofmeyer tomorrow i put it to u Maleka is the Boss. He must do Zuma
lufuno Justice Ramashia,this woman is dangerous lies got short hand who is pastor JJ this guy is defending himself unnecessary who is this Mahlangu
Nelson Musoliwa,Has this guy volunteered or subpoenaed to give testimony here? He is in tatters mos This guy is type of our black professionals excellence; he baana; we are in trouble mos What happens to individuals who appeare before the Zondo comm and tell lie under that oath?
Robert Russell,Eish..... imagine being married to Kate Hofmyer and having a domestic.....?????? there will always only be one winner 😃 😃 😃 The DCJ must chuck Zuma to her when he appears If you don't tell the truth...... someone else will. These GUYS at the office must have been very busy @Wilson Hishono ...... from PicknPay Con Artist..... Tenderprature...... steal where ever you can I wonder if he is connected in the ANC...... would not surprise me at all if he was @Thando Nkutha ....if we had the 5th amendment in South Africa..... the 5th Parliament would have used it at their SONA 😃 How many millions was he trying to steal from SAA????? Zuma vs Hofmeyer........ best defense ever Kate Hofmeyer is NOT a prosecutor two different fields in law ANOTHER 75million FFS I don't think he is coming back tomorrow.... Flight to Dubai Kate for President
Mark Waner,"she is not dangerous they were on the floor selling cars. notj nothing to do with BNP Paribas it's in the nature of his business to lie. judge getting a frustrated.this guy is like a 10 year old caught stealing from the tuck shop. "it would be so much better if he just said ""there was a fat juicy tender and we cut corners to try and get it""" "not BNP she should be next Public Protector State capture is a cancer. This young man was exposed to millions without any life experience and he is being eaten up by it. Zuma has to go to jail.
Sakhele Malunga,Can he stop with 'Apples with apples' already. We are tired of these lies...
Bruno Kgongwana,"Lies has got short legs Typical presentation of cognitive dissonance how many fly by night MBA institutions are offering MBA that is not helping anyone to think miss Hoffmeyer is not playing game. Zondo provides clarity when it seems people pretend not to understand the question.no place to hide Beauty with brains Unfortunately clarity is the first law of learning What hindsight is this guy refering to No wonder why MBA individuals are looking to be employed rather than create employment Who was helping this guy to answer questions in an MBA exam hahahaha """Trauma inflicted on us"" this is typical post traumatic apartheid syndrome that we need to heal ourselves from" I think investigation must be done on authenticity of the MBA institutions "The use of this guy terminology Signature on documents make them feel important Young with elevated self-concept "hot water is under statement "I rest my case What have we become
makhongelesteve makhongelesteve,This lady seems know something about this guy
Yolo More,And who is this hot yummy thing? He is nervous. I miss advocate September Vincent Nthomang😂😂😂😂😋😋😋 Yho! Shame marn. He feels like running now and never come back. You rather sing like Aggrizzi. Me too Sipho Sepale In hindsight This is not a discussion mfondini Shame marn. Who is your handler Mahlangu? He does not have any file all of a sudden Yes Owen Nyilika "Jayden Bango they mean business Me too Sindiswa Moolman. How old is he by the way? He looks 22 """That's true SSCHAIR"" 😅😅😅" It's getting hotter these days. We won't feel this Winter with all the crooks in the line-up. Mngadi is going to cross examine his fellow crook Michel Wild why is your name blue? Are you one of the hackers? "Sepale 😂😂 in days like these "Shame "Adv Hofmeyer is organized Peer Venter and Thando Nkutha😂😂😋😋 "Felix Muyoba Norman Zwane😄😄😄 vetkoek. Oh! Shame marn. They must not show his face marn. I feel sorry for him. He is scared marn. He must just sing once and for all. Nkululeko Zondo. You seem to know him very well. Pramodpatel Pramodpatel what are you doing here if you don't know what is this all about? ARE YOU A HACKER? Easy-come cash is deadly. He is looking at his attorney Hofmeyer is deadly gevaaar She puts the water down.😂😂Ai! It's hot. Don't show his face SABC pls. I don't wanna cry. I know many people who got tenders with suspended licences "Out of all the witnesses in this Commission "Brian Muleya "Hahaha Thando Nkutha sick leave Keith you only came now. Bye
Scott Courtnell,No - it is another BNP - no link
KQ-O’ American Lady,see all her hand and face signals? To Whom? I agree @Thembisa Man I should talk to people about What happened to me in Real life she’s giving so many hand signals. "It’s hard to explain This is fascinating 🤨🤥 look at her book hahahaha Ahahahaha Fake names of fake people I’d bet Mr Fun to move oh now you’ll be honest? to be honest with you? What Ethical Boss does that? Amen 🙏🏼 What? So another man can sign a love letter to your wife? ahhhhhhh As soon as the Boss leaves hahahaha too funny Rewrite Rewrite hahahaha

Thozamile Yapi,Adv Hofmeyer kaboom! All rise!
11soccerdad,How do you know someone has an MBA........THEY TELL YOU.
Hermiomie Asreal,@11soccerdad and how do you know the have an outstanding dissertation..? They also tell you! "As far as I'm concerned if they are found to have been complicit he just assumed y'all "how many times has he said ""...in hindsight...""" I am certain this is where Adv Hofmeyr was going as she earlier asked about that declaration of the accuracy of the info @Yolo More JZ "@Granny Mokwena the ""L"" word?" not hindsight again he should just admit that he's lazy to read so he told them to sign on his behlaf "@Michael Wild that's why I don't feel sorry for most of the witnesses
Thabani Shezi,"howeee Mahlangu wishes a tsunami can hit park own now😳
Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha Financial loans as far as I am aware. @Thando Nkutha No problem "@Hermiomie Asreal More like ""blindside""" He's in serious trouble @Raymond Fitzgerald No - he works for BNP @Mark Waner Aaah - OK @Felix Muyoba Yep - Mngadi set him up as the fall guy
Mzalwane Mzala,Has this guy not cracked yet? Why? that's true @Vincent Nthomang @funicanz How did he correct it 😁😁😁 This day is becoming too long for Mahlangu. @Thando Nkutha A lesson to be learnt is that sign for nothing without understanding. It starts small The lesson is for all of us who still do that What was Moyo's position in the company? Ziyabheda
Bozista Elias,ha ha ha ha
Felix Muyoba,this guy is just like manyi. he will never admit @Peet Venter if one is stupid yes but if you are honest then it is better just to say i was wrong.. nature of business? "it was an incorrect decision any how his counsel was supposed to tell him what to say not talk rubbish hindsight..did he learn this in his incompleted MBA? @Owen Nyilika you tell me that you only know these business ethics now? no man..this guy is just lying.. lip chewing now.. nature of our business that is how governance works no man..this guy doesnt understand what he is being asked actually mngadi will be exonerated and everything will lie on this guy shoulder..he was a fool @Yolo More youth is not an excuse.. this guy is just a crook this guy is just lying just come to the point
Tebogo Nhlapo,The man is answering the questions carefully and not nervous at all.. when dealing with legal minds you always need to answer carefully. Hofmeyr is confusing info requested at RFI and RFQ "Mr Mahlangu is doing well You need to understand the info given at the RFI stage and info submitted with final bid which is RFQ. She keeps making inferences to the bid price and he says we submitted rates with RFI Young and smart Expired license Thando Yes Suspended that’s correct
Thembelani,"hi guys Thanks okes This Director doesn't pay attention. He just signes qha yhoooo this guy 🤦 cheers guys
Craig Woodward,Every tender I've seen has that question that requires a Y/Nanswer His responses mean he has no conscience and understanding of what an oath or the truth is. "I'd love to know what other Private Equity firms think about the ""ature of our business ?" This is actually laughable - this guy is ignorant... no business acumen whatsoever... @Tebogo Nhlapo Do you honestlybelieve what you wrote? "I honestly wouldn't trust this guy to flip a burger "I hope he didn't go to the toilet now
