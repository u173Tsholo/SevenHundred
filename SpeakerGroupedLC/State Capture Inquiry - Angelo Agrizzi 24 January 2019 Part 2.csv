Kids Collie,VOLUME @SABC Digital News .iIll I am beginning to suspect that the Special Commercial Crime unit has pursuaded him to help them build a case against the corrupt officials. Maybe they are fed up that all their cases gets side tracked by corruption @Yose Human For the sake of everyone's sanity . . . PLEASE STOP @Yose Human Do you think we are morons? We read your comment the first time you posted it I blocked him. I know I am not that clever but FAAAAK this guy is irritating On the outskirts of KZN I think it is time to beef up his protection Glynnis Breytenbach was removed most probably because of this Glynnis Breytenbach was notorious of not bending to anyone It is Mti in the recording I think Julius is laughing is ar$e off #BringbackBreytenbach @Myka'Al Daud Remember Julius supported Zuma to become president @STSHEPANA THE DUDE Nope @Myka'Al Daud And Julius was silent while in the ANCYL @Mamphela Matlawa Which they put in office in the first place. You can't be this blind cANCer @Mamphela Matlawa Do you know how much money he must have recieved if he owed Sars R16 Million? @Desmond Masilela But Cyril was Deputy President. Was he blind and deaf? "Agrizzi is showing us how he connected the dots. We can't now have dots and refuse to see the connection. Cyril Much respect for Zondo I guess if the ANC vilify anyone it is an indication that they are not corrupt Who stole more? Bosasa or Guptas? We need a whistle blower like Agrizzi who worked with the Guptas
Pholani Ndlovu,"Maybe Angelo ate too much during lunch He was on fire in the morning 😉😉 They are in Mti's office and that is Mti not Zuma
Victor Malatji,volume
Mzalwane Mzala,Volume please Jackie Lepinka Advocate Nomgcobo Jiba of the NPA Leornard Mrhwebi Linda Richman Mti The president is not in the meeting Malema believes the rogue unit story Tom Moyane has been peddling this rogue unit story. Linda Mti speaks isixhosa and so do the Watson brothers Malema brought us Zuma. @Tholithemba Ntsele Was Malema not one of them? Malema led the charge to remove Mbeki before the end of his term. @Mncedisi Sibula The Watsons were part of the anti apartheid struggle and so they were always close to ANC structures Nongcobo Jiba is not an ANC leader Lauwrence Mrwebi is not an ANC leader

ST James Rama,ENCA not covering this today? Did everyone see the belt that Agrizzi is wearing? LV Louis Viutton. Goes to show that Agrizzi was well looked after I think the ANC is being run by other individuals. The President and the ministers are just front men If some government official approached you and said i want to transfer 10 million into an account of someone who already has a tender can you help me... What would you guys do? Michael Wild 10M is a lot of money Before the elections a lot of money is going to go missing... Mark my words Yose you are reffering to King Dalinyebo Vote Individual and not Party Where does Agrizzi stay? Where does he stay Yoh wow Did Zuma ever decide things on his own 🐁 Those 👀 James Bond kinda spy 👀 I also want to hear Zuma Zuma is laughing in the background Haaaaa ene uye U zuma That is definately Zuma's voice Zuma had Flue The Xhosa guy who is he Julius Malema protected Zuma because he was fed lies... Only later he realised that he supported a wrong horse Trully speaking i also supported Zuma because i saw this ANC leadership being Xhosa after Xhosa "We supported Zuma to cut the Xhosa lineage that the ANC was following... Mandela No Peter it wasn't a racist thing... The ANC was off path Mbeki warned us yes but he also wanted to impose that lady on us... I wonder how many fake ballot papers have been printed by now... The only way the ANC will win is through fake ballots More like a 🎺 blower I will correct my 5years ago mistake this coming elections Zizi Kodwa? Zizi is there to take notes Was Pule Mabe found guilty of sexual harrasment? Hahahahaha Sibusiso🤣🤣

Magda Seguin,Zuma's relationship with Bosasa and specifically Watson corrupted the entire ANC and even the NPA in relation to tebders.Rotten to the core. Anyone who still votes for the ANC would seem to be ok with corruption. Its about how the NPA dicerted and squashed the Bosasa cases *diverted The ANC manifesto is a load of hogwash...promises and nothing else Yose Human there were news24 inestigative articles for more than teb years but nobody took action...that is why the NPA was bribed by Bosasa to squash the evidence Apologies for the typos Mrwebi and Jiba are under investigation currently Mrwebi and Jiba was this week on the PIC hearings ....is right here on YT Agrizzi said it is role play by Watson before going to see Zuma Its role play!! Practising before going to see Zuna Breytenbach was proven to be innocent...he was set up.Dont you guys follow what is happening in SA? This is the reason why Zuma got rid of Breytenbach and Dramat...they were vilified Most public servants that were honest were submitted to smear campaigns by the ANC corrupt crooks Watson is evil personified Imagine Watson and the Guptas were running the country...they were telling Zuma what to do Bosasa stole tenders for 17 years Zuma must be charged with treason...many many lives destroyed with no healthcare arc. Zizi is implicated too... Children are still being taught under trees and dilapidated schools Carlotta Wilson Amen If Agrizzi didnt blow the whistle this will never have come to light "Desmond Masilela he has concrete evidence...numbers Smith even had his father bought a house by Watson in a retirement home SA's must let the ballot box do the talking...ANC must fall I shudder to think some may walk free and still get fat pensions from taxpayers money Michael Wild they will put a spin on it and people will fall for it Zizi Kodwa says the ANC is incorruptible....spin to the nth degree The evidence is mounting.... The US can extradite Mansell One can live royally in the US with monthly $7k payments This is the longest testimony at the Commission so far
BALOYI JUSTICE,poor sound

Wildthing,say no jail is a bad place just block yose it will make your day better It is wrong to take part in any means of corruption. helping move money is know as money laundering. It has jail time too. to stop prosecution $1 = R13.8 just think if South Africa produced goods to sell how well we would do with.such a low R. but guess what we buy more than what we make and sell. he is on the phone call that's him he had a cold at the time give Zonda a beets headset Ha ha yes many must say sorry to Breytenbak all block yose now we know why Breytenbag withdrew from NPA roll something bigger was coming and she knew. now she can be a witness. I hope the women down in Natel is not our new NPA now quiz question. how many times did Zuma shuffle his parliament Zuma Ambassadors recalled yesterday. No real reason given. now we know why. The tin soldiers are falling one at a time. owe no withdrawn issues waiting until Monday
