Lorna Kavanagh,isnt the commission starting at 9.30 today? Neo you are talking a load of racist rubbish. Hate speech.
Jane .Blamire,Yes it is McBride is there Oh Cr#p. Problems They are highlighting possibles problems. Very important that this testimony is not challenged later. Welton you are missing the point Both Zondos are lawyers/judges chairing inquiries. Conflict of both inquiries have same witness. This is just a legal issue to make sure all done correctly Agree Magda. People must listen first before jumping to conclusions Agree Eslon. Very tricky Pretorius making absolutely that there are NO loopholes to protect this testimony They are now in public. This testimony must be VERY important with all this fuss!!! Disagree Welton. All issues have to be brought forward in public This background info is important to put testimony into context "The Democratic Party (DP) Thanks Derek Thuli for President Quinton has large wooden spoon Blocking Quintin. He is troll trying to distract us 5059 watching. must be a record?

Magda Seguin,Bonjour The Daily Maverick has a riveting article on the of alleged implicated in the judiciary that may be divulged here today Morning Madelein Yoh!! @Mbuso please no nonsense comments today @Welton we must hear the evidence first @Eslon he has to outline to the Chairman how proceedings will go...very necessary @welton...agree but we still need to hear the what and why "Apparently as soon as the NPA is ready during the commission @romeo you are jumping the gun I still have the first book McBride wrote about his imprisonment and being on death row @romeo you have not even heard what it is about yet you make judgements...Pretorious is asking now but we don't know the details hence we can't just make judgements @romeo glad you see the light Please give us the details first before talking about recusal He is an investigator NOT a sitting judge in a court of law NO he was the lead in the McBride disciplinary I am tired of explaining...just going to listen now @Jane everybody jumps to conclusions on this thread...no discernment This commission is absolutely necessary...we would have carried on wondering why the country is bankrupt Thanks Jane you are correct All this is due to ANC factionalism.The top six are divided and give out conflicting statements on a daily basis Read Gangster State...Ace corrupted everybody...he wants eventually to be President @Dominic...correct who knows if the legal team are not being spooked...they are everywhere @Sfiso...The public must also be informed...joining the dots @peter pott and ATM is making inroads in by elections..Big surprise but no so big knowing that their electioneering are in churches @Afrika while there is humongous greed by our leaders nothing will happen Most state and government institutions are compromised by corruption Mc Bride is from KZN...Wentworth to be exact I never denied that the private sector is also corrupt but the people entrusted with public money and purporting to serve the people are stealing on a grand scale The dynamic between Cele and Mc Bride led to him being kicked out...The report Cele sent to the Police Committee in Parliament was damning that is why they ousted him...t That is how the ANC deal with those who are on the right side of the law @Danie are you planning a coup? And who are 'we? CR is in Alex @Lorna I blocked him weeks ago @Danie Nielsen you are not replying to my questions @Funicanz Lorna says that Neo is making racists comments Who are WE? @Danie Nielsen why the arms? And who do you intend using it against? @Cerebis the only 'WE' I can speculate on is the far right wing @Danie Nilsen we have a constitution which protects our rights...what constitution are you talking about? @Cerebis and what us that? armed conflict in our country...civil war? I want PEACE.Period.Never want to by ruled by white supremists ever again!! My parents died not knowing freedom. Daniel is talking about taking up arms and everybody just ignores it? @Masingita Character assasination?WOW! @Cerebis We are on the same page but Danie is an arms stash in a neighbouring country ready to take up arms...what is that about?I challenged him..it is hate speech I never called anyone mental @Cerebis thanks I know about Roets and his cronies who is going about asking the US right wing to make trouble in SA 3.5 people online..The highest so far since the commission started @Aubrey Moloi Spot on WMC is a Bell Pottinger/Gupta invention..please stop using it! @ayanda correct...those who were in exile and those who remained in the country was already at loggerheads @Eslon fact is there is a load of other evidence apart from the Zondo connection..in fact it's a small part They need a break @Eslon you are right anythi g is possible l @Audrey Moloi that is why Jiba's qualifications was questioned at PIC.She was so arrogant How will we see justice and take back pur country from these criminals "Yes Please do yourself a favour and read Gangster State:The Unravelling of Ace Magashule...he stole most of the money meant for development..billions.The Estina story is just a drop in the ocean @Eslon if they come back it will be a travesty Surve is another one...eish that man was lent over billions by PIC without due diligence @Anne I worked with Section27 and TAC with the collapse of the healthcare in the Free State...we are well aware We love SA with our souls...it's our home A group representation...wow! The fact that they formed a group representation is dodgy Mc Bride us sitting at the witness table @Bongumenzi it is in his first book he wrote after he came put of death row Dram at and McBride was set up by the NPA that they turned over people to Zim.The case was shown to be untrue in the High Court @rohan how do you know?He has not even spoken yet CR made McBride Head of Integrity Committee of parliament last week e 4.3 people online 4.4k people now @Cedrick do you trust Zuma? @Erin the ANC bankrupted the country already nothing more to steal Watch Eskom putting everyone in darkness after the election...no taxes to pay as the economy crashes further @Erin Helen Suzman was the only Progressive Party parliamentarian during apartheid After that Colin Eglin Our kids are not being taught the right history of apartheid...recently SADTU complained that teachers regularly bunk school "@Thamsanqa thank you my brother...those who read and know the facts discern between being called a terrorist and the cross border raids Apartheid is a crime against humanity...read the UN documents "I dont trust ANY policeman The ANC use the youth now to do their dirty work just like the schoolkids in the 80's "The thieves in the ANC does not give me hope The white government INVENTED apartheid.I was arrested for marrying a white foreigner...don't argue with people who have a lived experience of apartheid And I had to go to another country to marry...hounded by apartheid police I had to leave the country when I was at the peak of my career Both of us We left before they could report him @Danie Nilsen Ever heard of the Mixed Marriages Act.You are exposing your ignorance @Daniel Nilsen it was commonly known as the 'Immorality Act'.Zakes Me a wrote of a whol I know what I know...I lived it..there is no confusion between the two This is obviously a BIG story...4.9k people watching The justice system ties to organised crime that is why Mazotti and the underground gangs is what he is describing Police working with criminals No wonder cash in transit heists are so prevalent Look how many underworld foreigners are being assassinated regularly with no consequences Gangster State "I have a copy of Till Babylon Falls..it is quite appropriate here @rohan not a lot of people know about Dr Death aka Wouter Basson who created and manufactured Mandrax to flood the Cape Flats in the aim to enslave the community We know about that too as well as the bodies dropped in the sea off the West coast This sounds like a cross examination..wow I'm not here to take tests Or give lessons The info is freely available in archives go and search on your own Then you are searching well enough Bless your grandma @rohan.There are tons of credible information I have a entire Afrikana library. what are you referring to @Benny Bala

Than you Jones. @Quintin Jacobs. üòÇüòÇüòÇ Every time he says I will deal with that in the moment and late he don't go back and deal with that issue. Neo blocked @Frik Brits. I dont want to see his comment Im just waiting for Mcbride to give his testimony. Because Pretorius is giving me hard time really Seems like we not going anywhere today. The witness has not even took stand. I think Pretorius is done. This is the man we all waiting for What has this guy done to his hair. is that fashion also. This guy is trying to delay the process. This commission is trying to help us to think carefully when voting any party. "Marikana commission So how on earth can this commission take ppl to court or jail when they failed to put ppl in jail before. Jail and court is meant for me and you guys. If you dont have money you go straight to jail!!! This thing of due course irritates me. If it was you!! you would be now in jail for 8yrs behind bars. from 2010

Dumile Mateza,@Thando Nkutha there is a Constitutional court judgement regarding the independence of IPID in the Nhleko vs McBride case law. Your leaders propensity to steal led them to Gaddfi.We are still looking for Gaddafi's money. There is television footage of Zuma and Cwele inside the compound and inside the palace. Apparently another dictator has stepped down the President of Sudan Omar Al Bashir and the ICC is waiting topounce on him Those are the wasted years Can somebody stop Neo from rambling Neo is busy promoting another Judiciary Commission. Who do you reoresent Neo.? Who sent you to promote this Commission? We shoild not believe any of the trite that is peddled by the likes Aubrey and Malema about the removal of Cyril. After the elections the SG and his deputy could be removed at the NGC @Mzwalane Mzala Cyril would have one the ANC near two thirds majority and his arm will bw strengthened and his detractors will be removed both as cabinet ministers and position of influence. This introduction of evidence is the Law of Evidence 101 Ths takes are high in the Gaddafi money saga Hillary Clinton or the ambassador in Libya at the time could be called to give evidence. That is why the King is jittery. Representing all the crooks @Chris Welensky any relationship to the Welensky who was at one time President of what used to be Rhodesia @Magda Seguin no the mixed marriages act was separate from the immorality Act. The Mixed Marriages Act was to prevent blacks marrying Whites and vice versa. The Immorality Act was different. The Immorality Act was to prohibit sexual contact between these two groups. @Neo Mongale because aparheid was perpertuated by a state no court in South Africa has jurisdiction over such crimes except for the ICC. There is another book on McBride by Bryan Rostron titled Till Babylon Falls. Which was a line in a letter he wrote to his mother on death row. I am enrolling at the Stellenbosch University Business School and my study will be based on whether the empowerment of the Afrikaners through the Afrikaner Broeder bond can be replicated. Who is digitalmotionfilms we could form a bond on a series of documentaries and create a platform like National Geographic They will tell you Orania is a family farm

Debate in the ANC was never due to tribal affiliations. A brave cadre of MK He used to be the most hated man in the white community. It is election season and we do not listen to each other. The UDM's Kwankwa was ignored in parliament when he said the IPID director can only work well when he stops reporting to Minister of Police @Eketsang Diaho Amandla! @Cerebis the ANC NEC took a position on the creation of a judicial commission before the public protector ruled on the matter. @Dumile Mateza Immorality Act covered even sex outside of marriage "Read Mcbride's biography by Gomolemo Mokae ' Robert Mcbride
