Fred Desrosiers,"please people peacefully. looting defeats the purpose it has started on the other channel Are there not competitors to Clic? support business where we feel welcome better if we create our own businesses and employ people. "Start your own business today "The black community of South Africa has the most purchasing power "I am beginning to think that no one is going to be punished for the billions that were mismanaged He is struggling.. This is getting confusing. the list was supposedly 'imposed' by the minister when he is Chairman of the Board. no COB would have allowed that ok. now he is telling the truth
Luyanda Qokama,Mr Zondo you're late let me go check that other channel
Sal SA,Late start is normal but as long as we making progress:goodvibes: It's a long walk to freedom guys:goodvibes: Housekeeping!

Joe Lekalakala,what are we still waiting for?
John Spendpenny,"Boycotting is one thing
Jan Smith,boycot clicks who employs 80% black can be negatively effected makes no sense. Who will support them if they loose jobs or pay. Definitely not those calling for boycot of blackmanaged company
James Godloza Godloza,morning every one
Thobani Mkananda,It's only Fikile Mbalula who testified before the commission without a shirt and tie ü§£üòÇ @James Godloza Godloza Splendid morning to you too @Salome Seabe we are happy that you've repented. We hope you'll be able to influence repentance of many ANC voters. Power to you üòÉ‚úäüèΩ It would be nice to read about the life of the guptas hey ü§î "@Akhonamandla Gala "@Akhonamandla @Akhonamandla üòÇü§£ Eish ja neh @Akhonamandla 'Ja neh' stands in the stead of 'wow' today ü§£üòÇüòÖ @Akhonamandla How much say do we actually hold on how they choose their actors and paint the story? ü§£ He'd fit to play that part but I never heard him speak English on set @Akhonamandla Thabo Mbeki shied away from the apartheid prosecutions and in my view he gave a safe space for many evils that we're suffering in the present day "This is an opportune time for an excerpt of the recordings of the ""robust"" engagement of the boardü§î" There we go again with the signal problems
Zodwa Dlamini,mximu I dont want to listen to this 2 old people waste of time
Akhonamandla Gala,"Fikile likes to think he is a national hero "@Shange @Thabo don't forget Zuma @Garth lol true @Garth Nomvula will also blame Watson since he knows he's no more "if nothing will happen from this commission's report @Thobani i believe in future they will make blockbuster movies about these stories we are hearing here.... Guptas will have their movie as well. its a matter of time "@Thobani they will do a thorough research and all "lol but i didn't promote nationalization.... i believe our constitution is fine the way it is "lol @Thobani the film industry @Thobani i just hope they will use our south African actors in those movies instead of abo Danzel. we want magubane to act Zumas role @Thobani aka Mr Wow also known as Mr Jah neh @Bongiwe i agree the Chair haven't gathered all the facts yet so how does he know who is guilty? Mbeki was trying his best
Mfundo,Does anybody know who is representing/legal team Mr Zola Tsotsi?
Michael Douglas,what we'll gain as a nation by listening to this state capture inquiry?how many people have found guilty and arrested for corruption no even one so stop wasting taxpayers money.

Nondumiso Soko,I'm still puzzled by the fact that Eskom raised funds for the ANC how sway???? which party are we going to trust???.... the Z83 form is useless guys they have lists no CVS needed "I don't know how many times I applied using that form last year psssh just a waste of time..... fo sho u need an ANC membership with an inside connection the Guptas are everywhere üëèüëè
Salome Seabi,anc takes us 4 granted/ that surprises me.but I dont myself I dont trust this Tsotsi yaa his name is tsotswi thwiiii tsotsi ya nnete "the chair is very energetic today "@Gala defintely they will kiss state power goodbye @Gala anything except Anc will be fine @Gala away with nationalisation. that wont work.it will do more harm than all thecorruptions combined The mood of Mr Tsotsi today is down.what happened to this madala @Moeli mayby he received some troublesome calls after his evidence yesterday @Mokoena agreed but why are they forcing pple to use it z83 form the chair knows all who r guilty already. that I agree "but the NPA is slow some evidence are irrebutable "if u hear the chair saying it is strange thechair is anouncing his verdict on the gupas now the chair is issuing his preliminary findings now Seriti commision was a fus.somebody must be liable for the millions used in the seriti commision mbeki wanted to rule until the return of christ "if mbeki comes back mbeki commited genocide mbeki shirt

Ntsikelelo Vani,morning Nobhatyi
Tremaine Bent,BUT YET WE STILL VOTE ANC???? TIME FOR CHANGE GUYS!!!!
Ghost Mapetla,Haaaa not this time around This country is set up in a way that looting is the only way to live decent life kids education oversea medical treatment oversea H2O Perrier after they announce a recession The problem is money is power and others are allowed to have it while others remain powerless
Njabulo Mthiyane,"cha I ANC ine influence namandla futhi "and you won't see ANC protesting racism coz they knew how high the probability of racism would be against black people when they made vague and untrasparent deals with abacindezeli 
Residentc,"The whole ANC is a mafia gangstars masquerading as freedom fighters "the rot is too deep "Salim Essa "The big project was spurios charges. force people to settle out of court. make the board weaker by appointing our accomplices. go go mr zondo. that was the whole project in the main
Carmen James,So much outside interference in ESKOM. No wonder it is a BIG MESS today...It was just a money pot for looters!!!!! @Thabo Mokoaleli Let him sing.... @Garth Muller The Commission needs to know what went down......All this interference by compromised politicians and their enablers....Ridiculous!!!! @Thabo Mokoaleli .....What a crook!!!! When is Nick Linnell appearing before the Commission???? Nick Linnell big fixer....He needs to SING!!! A sitting President SOLD the country to the Guptas.....The Guptas had a ravenous appetite. Today they are sitting pretty with the stolen monies while our Country bleeds!!!!!!!
Thabo Mokoaleli,Tsotsi is singing like Canary üòÇü§£ Ace Magashule and Nomvula Mokonyane must wear orange outfit Mark my words it will happen Of course Zuma is Grand Mafia of the nexus:goodvibes: This September is going to bring most of the culprits in jail. lt might be this week from what I sense. l think it comes from what I experienced in life. You can be surprised what l went through in my life Lebitso leme ke seromaü§£üòÇü§∑ I don't need a Court to know who is guilty The should be results out of this Commission "Believe me Z83 was long scrapped. lt is no longer in existence Make no mistake this Commission knows what their doing. They only gather material evidence. All evidence is recorded. We don't need to play a race issue here. There facts are bare "If the Chairperson Zondo was white
Nkululeko Njapha,how you know?@Residentc and how deep? feel us in. For what Thabo @Thabo Mokoaleli Why? RSA is a constitutional democracy people don't wear orange outfits because you dislike them. There is process and that process must be afforded to everyone e-respective of your view Zola was part of the problem and he lying @Thabo Mokoaleli you watch movies too much @Thabo Mokoaleli I say this because it appears you have already concluded the outcomes of the commission. You seem to know who is guilty and who innocent with no court process. Guilty e-respective @Thabo Mokoaleli how does the process of finding someone guilty work in this country? @Thabo Mokoaleli perhaps you should assist the commission and provide evidence since you know who is guilty. I presume you have evidence for your guilty verdict.
Tom Thumb,@Carmen James his sing because his lawyers told him the Guptas are gone my friend save yourself @Gala watch how Nomvula is also going to try save herself this afternoon lol @Carmen James its going to be a long night for me in NZ i only get three hours sleep lol @Gala an @Seabi whatever happens after this commission the EFF wants to All S.O.E Nationalised so can you imagine what is going to happen then trillions will go missing then and Cry the beloved SA

NARE REFILOE,:buffering:
Bongiwe Moeli,"True Mr TSOTSI was conflicted between towing the party line and being ethical. He appears weak "Wow "There is poor understanding of public service
lovejoy mangolo,That is true
Lazarus Mpofu,"Tsotsi
Owen Nyilika,@MOKOENA Z83 is for poor people to apply in government Wy this things not happening under Mr Mbekis time @Alpheas thanks u answer me no more Question now
Riaan DW,Z83 is maby for the unconnected people ü§£ It is a collective effort and everyone in the ANC knows what is going on. My humble opinion. Best is when the chair laughs with/at the witness/accused ü§£ "Brown just sent SMS "Let's see  "Gupta's has to sign off first enca live
Melusi Mabuza,The big Gns uses the smal guns to loot the state. It sadüòìüòìüòìüòì
Tshepo Mogobe,Minister Brown is throwing Mr Tsotsi under the bus about the proposed list of Board members
Blake Yogi,"If he says its strange I love this sound Zondo makes either before or during question or comment. Do yal know what sound Im talking about
Vincent Hoburn,Reality is that party politics in this country will always trump justice. Eskom - SAA - SA Express - Transnet - Petro SA and numerous other SOE's and their Executive will never face justice Never EVER Justice - Accountability and Democracy are Western concepts forced on Africa by colonialists - We need to understand this
lizzietitana,the truth shall set you free what about the Seriti commission take place under Mbeki Mbeki had his fair chance either not a Saint. Mandela did not finish his term handed it to mbeki n took over also his 2 terms mbeki wanted 2 centers of powers as if he's the only leader. there were 7 presidential candidates so we have to scrutinize all of the donor's to be open Zuma cost this country. let me remind you about the nuclear deal thanks to the former Minister Nene for refusing with his signature
Mcesecs Nyoka,this commission started long time ago and there are no arrests have have took place... it's just a waste of time and money.
Johnno D,"The day I see an implicated minister go to jail True Thabo
Michael Holmes,yoh amagupta and these useless guys black professionals were the target of guptas and zuma race card used to divert questions about corruption is so criminal mbeki helped disband the Scorpions!!! mbeki killed people with his policy on HIV!! mbeki protected Jackie Selebi "no comrade go read chronology
Ship Ahouy Selaki,no one will be arrested and jailed it is just a waste of public monies
Angelo Doubel,@ Akhonamandla : under the leadership of the mbeki. He was president best president in the history SA in growing the economy. @ Phakamile. remember Thabo mbeki fired Zuma for the corrupt relationship with Sabier shake. @Salome. Did you know under mbeki Leadership. we are only African country who has perment seat @ G8
Didi Motshaba-Monchusi,an economist at heart
Phakamile Khuzwayo,in mbeki economy was growing
Eric Mbhekwa,Mbeki wanted to separate State from the party politics.
katleho sekolanyane,"I really dotn have patience for this Evidence leader
Lonwabo Mbana,@Michael Holmes Mbeki asked for a week or two ensure that there is stability in police before head of police was arrested. No evidence showed him saying the then head if police shouldnt be prosicute. I am so greatful I was never in Mbekis shoes. You have Priorities Crime (Scorpions) fighting with SAPS. Then where is effective policing when you have two police bodies fighting against each other?
Mduduzi Thabede,But still that is tantamount to interference in the affairs of another sphere of government ...
Thami Ngwenya,"Cyril is bringing back scorpion "Ndlela Further you propagate tribalistic sydrome "He is the face of ANC Your politics are shallow and ill informed also sow division in the party. Your assertion is an insult to ANC and its members "If the NEC does not support him "Thanks
Gerard Victor,I thought this guy was only going to be in the hot seat for 45mins today
