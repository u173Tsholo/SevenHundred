Desmond Masilela,We back guy. Its like they blackmail them "@STEFAN VAN DEN BERG. And all those ppl that are been implicated are back on ANC seat. the likes of Gigaba @Anne M.. I think in this we should start to put blame on our current President. Dont you think so? who approve the names for ppl who are implicated? @Anne M.. The NPA should have done something now. Just to set an example that something will happen. "@Anne M.. Remember what happened with Agrizzi "The bomb is coming out now @Bridgette Kekana. Thank you Bridgette. Sabotaging from SABC is coming just now. @Thando Nkutha. By our government officials I like this Adv she's so organized. @Thando Nkutha. Thank you so much Thando. Now i can recall the difference between the two. @Ntombethemba Manase. The other one has Afro hair that I was confusing her with this one. "@Thando Nkutha This Adv since she's started I can not recall the chair assisting her with any question. How to put question. @Ntombethemba Manase. Everytime she put question the chair must intervene and assist. very frustration. 😂😂😂 @Ntombethemba Manase. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 "@Ntombethemba Manase. So This witness and Mr Jonas "@Ntombethemba Manase. Yes they speak the truth @Billy Mathibela. The smalanyana Fish Malusi Gigaba and Brown.
Chiang Mai Springbok,little more volume plse witness needs to get closer to mic.
Magda Seguin,@Yin Yang and to think they will get fat pensions when they retire...it should be stopped as it is taxpayers money Yes @Anne M. they deserve nothing Lyn Brown pleaded innonence and denied in parliament that shevwas involved Look at Prasa today...Ramaphosa says heads must roll but the ANC list says otherwise..he should have sacked the implicated already A bot Paid troll Blocked @John-Basel youvare condescending...you ony arrive here and make such uninformed statements You guys work in groups on social media...I know your MO Lyn Brown was completely captured Nine years of systematic breakdown of SOE's The submarines are apparently not even in use Fana Hlongwane was the arms deal broker...Andrew Feinstein is an ex parliamentarian who wrote 'After the Party' explains it all as he was against buying the arms Andrew Feinstein also wrote 'The Shadow World'...based on global arms deals and the bribery involved Andrew Feinstein was an ANC politician who resigned in disgust over the arms deal @makhosi Yes Zuma was involved in the arms deal...some of charges against him are still in progress @makhosi...we are all very traumatised and pained as ex ANC voters I already decided that the Polokwane mess was the end and decided that I will never vote for the ruling party ...I have become apolitical Some in the branches are also captured Yes @Anne she is cleaning upcas we speak "State capture destroyed so many lives and families...its an unknown @Stefan even if he is arrested he will be out in hours on bail and his lawyers will make sure that the cases are dragged out @Stefan I agree... @Stefan...NEVER my friend...there is no moral compass in the ANC @Anne Theresa May is running a very confused Tory party and she is running around back and forth to Brussels for a Brexit deal which is not going to work "The Brita who voted leave the EU are regretting it The Britas are stocking up on food...it's a disaster May 28 is the deadline for Brexit " *SOE's The Guptas had lots of shelf companies...here in SA and even Dubai...only a post box and address...nothing else Sometimes the address is an open held or an empty building in an industrial area @Anne and @Makhosi...it's the nature of state capture...read the World Bank 2000 definition of state capture.The Guptas must have PhDs in state capture..lol I second that @Makhosi Lesotho kicked out the Guptas long ago...they were more awake than our government Apparently the extradition process is in progress Even if the Commission costs money I think the SA public has the right to know what happened and who was involved Exactly @Robert Russell...The Guptas also wanted to capture other African countries
Anne M.,"@Magda Seguin If they haven't already resigned Dismissal only Corrupt or inept? @John-Basel Ioannou DDG in Dept of Public Enterprises "Sad "@makhosi nobhatyi Yes @Michael Wild Which brings us back full circle to the arms deal I don't remember where I read an article that stated few countries have done arms deals without there being some sort of kickback or corruption involved. "Thanks Magda "@STEFAN VAN DEN BERG The commission's investigators are giving information to the NPA @Desmond Masilela I know the branches put their names forward but they should have done the proper thing by declining @STEFAN VAN DEN BERG The NPA has just appointed a new head - Shamila Batohi who served on the International Criminal Court @Desmond Masilela I hear you @STEFAN VAN DEN BERG And that might be exactly what the president is waiting for - then he can appoint his own cabinet without the current factionalism It's politics. Theresa May has just survived 2 or 3 votes of no confidence. People have to vote along party lines. @Magda Seguin Yup - politics And it won't surprise me if Gavin Watson hasn't done something similar. "@John-Basel Ioannou We'll probably be in a tug of war with India

Felix Muyoba,@Edward Patrick are you asking his own understanding or definition of technocracy because you can google it.. @STEFAN VAN DEN BERG it is also for informing you (as a public member) what happened to your money unlike in your parents time (apartheid) where everything was secretive and if you question you dead.. "@Anne M. haa
makhosi nobhatyi,Zupta involvements declines occurred dramatically "@ Anne M this embarrassing to black professional really "I can’t wait the day Zuma being arrested surely country will be demonize by those supporters who shield for him "@magda seguin I was supporting Zuma Zuma creates a bill to protect information which is was to protect his shenanigans because they were shocked by revelation of Nkandla scandal Magda Seguin I told myself I will vote for other party to give Anc lessons as we did in 2016 because there was no hears to listen but after Ramaphosa won I come back home coz I know him very well Administration and policy implementation will happen in supervisory and no corruption will happen as you see him pushing very hard to bring back wat we have lost "I am very happy with what they sent to parliament "@ Masilela no President has nothing to do with candidates secretary does that "President laying on laws to prove then act because these people talking too much know how to demonize poor people so only thing we trust is the law These Zuma cronies put ANC into disrepute and ashamed "Viva ANC viva Forget it under Ramaphosa won’t happen courts will be busy now and all those who resigned from their position after they had done wrong will account "Stefan van den berg Ramaphosa "@kekane yes you would see frustrated by Zuma response not answering questions @ Masilela I think hair style help her so much 😀😀😀 she is confident and well prepared "Transnet and prassa will follow "Magda Seguin only these establishments just few weeks and get billions tender 😳😳 used sucking government coffers to be dry "Nomatter how deep may criticize mr Gordhan
