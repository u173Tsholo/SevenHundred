Myka'Al Daud,Fearfontein is making this guy fearful "Rama was the chairman of MTN when Iran charged the company with corruption.....FNB IEC to investigate anc for bosasa election funding "prisoner of hope Truth shall set us free PG refuses to be cross examined by Moyane Is he hiding something or just enjoying his rights? Did we pardon apartheid agents ? "SA is a forgiving nation "We forgiven sellouts who wrote letters to SB "We gave apartheid killers 2nd chance forgave "Why divide the country Moeinie kwaat wies is reraag Derek yes lets uproot this corrupt practices but lets vote for justice n dignity for everyone "Ramaphosa didn't clean MTN He is capitalist in sabbathical leave While he sat as board member FNBSA charged blacks more interests for loans "While he sat in board of directors at Lonmin blacks stayed in shacks with no services those benefiting from this class apartheid will support Rama They protect their comfort zone "Reading bias information is useless "What stopped Ramaphosa from reading
Felix Muyoba,@Desmond Masilela perhaps the guy was warned that since you are leaving eskom and you know what is happening here if you ever expose us we will come for you where ever you are.. @Yin Yang i now agree with you on that @Yin Yang as soon as he discovered some anomalies at eskom he left..he is an honest citizen.. @Myka'Al Daud do you think investigation can yield anything? @Myka'Al Daud if the rural people were eating and drinking at an anc rally with that money from bosasa..do you think they understand that it was illegal? they dont.. @Nelson Musoliwa they knew..just ignorance..typical of african ruling parties attitude.. "@Yin Yang what homelands @Michael Michael imagine! hau wena kobus!!! kobus is still dreaming about those olden days when all privileges were on his side "but if he is lying he will be caught because other witnesses will come expose him..so "@Musa Bakiti yes
Zox Alexandreez,where is the sound?
Wildthing,sound is on the left ear peace something wrong I can only hear one side. ha ha yes SABC tech will say he must speak over the mic and not from one side only. :) ANC have breached about 5 critical laws which should have them removed from taking part in voting for 8 years. until they clean up there act. and ask Venezuela to keep the MECs visiting them. I agree to in jail with the keys thrown away. Daud should have locked up Verwoerd but a white guy shot him before that could happen. Musa they put a hole in a corrupt persons head in China Mr Cash jump on your horse and ride on the EFF is birnnfrom ANC and a baby version of the ANC. Musa like making children below the age of 14 years old to hand out papers over the week end very bad. so no monopoly. you have more than one energy supplier he is EFF knows nothing ANC promised a great future that they could not give. and now the EFF I'd feeding off the same people that are now suffering even more caused by ANC. its time to look at reality and build from that. everyone that use should pay that is only fair. only people with special cases should be granted power until they can correct that. hope he is going to a meeting to then instruct Zuma's arrest
Nobby's Photography,sound in left speaker only my right ear is getting jealous with no sound
Frik Brits,"I think some people here need to reboot their PC's
Derek Main,@Myka'Al Daud Don't hold your breath - IEC is compromised "@MIKE LOCK I agree - if we want to stop the rot What I would like to know is if we taxpayers are going to be funding the legal defense for any of these criminals. I don't think we should. @Myka'Al Daud Let them come and confess their sins first and then we'll decide if they have revealed all and been truthful Myka'Al - can't argue with you there @Johnny Cash How old are you? -50? Ramaphosa was deputy president while all this was happening - he's implicated Ramaphosa and the entire ANC are on trial here @Songezo Nqonji Why? Are you saying the deputy president has no power? As part of the cabinet and the NEC he made the decision to protect Zuma Anybody from the ANC is a threat to Sa's fortunes - they have proven that and now it is all coming out Yep - those waiting for their turn at the trough ANC is corrupt to the core You're just scared Where was he 9 years ago? He was also deputy president of the ANC 9 years ago - surely he had some influence. Why didn't he use it? That's rich - you calling me a propagandist? Who am I a propagandist for? OK - forgive me 7 years ago Should have been enough time to do SOMETHING ANYTHING Stop lying - 18 December 2012
Isihlahla Samabhinca,we are waiting for Zuma's time
Nelson Musoliwa,Do we want to believe that the entire ANC esp the NEC didn't know that the dealing with bossasa was illegal? @Yin it is however difficult to believe that people who fought gallantly against oppression can do such a thing. Yang They were suffocated from the start not to develop to certain level by the regime as they were just spoon fed economically. Think this guy was heavily involved in this illegal operations at Eskom Dismiss this guy he is wasting the comm time
Aadil Mohammed,"Why waist state funds on this  Michael there is no excuse if you pardon one you must pardon all. He was clever enough to defraud the state so he is eligible to stand trial and go to jail.

"""I may have it was not my call""" "wow he is so the middle man though. he's taken the fall for his team what is this guys name? who is Koko? @Magda Seguin I am from Australia but born in South Africa I was born in Durban and moved to Australia with my family 18 years ago when i was a kid @Michael Michael yes absolutely no load shedding.

Margareth Waterboer,"Jeez
Magda Seguin,He said this morning he resigned due to being unhappy...he was probably forced to ok that 10 year contract but is scared to say by who @Rich Ziny you are speculating Remember he spoke about the coercion and bad atmosphere that even his boss was asked to leave He also said hierarchy played a huge part at Eskom...The superio The executive was controlling and no dissent was tolerated All these people was working in a hostile environment @Michael Michael these people were controlled by Koko and Molefe The captured ones were the Gupta lackeys put there by Zuma This guy was not high up in the hierarchy...he left because of the rot...li The real culprits are in hiding...we are waiting for Koko I suggest you guys read Jacques Pauw's book @TheRaz You are obviously not in the loop of state capture @Desmond Masilela Yes "@TheRaz I also live overseasbut I read SA news everyday....a suggestion "SA has excellent investigative journalists "@MIKE LOCK We are blessed Soweto residents owe Eskom R20 billion They are part of the problem I heard a Soweto women say that free electricity is in the ANC Freedom Charter Soweto residents also refused prepaid metres Me Hofmeyer acts as if she is in court "The SSA even spied on NGOs "Zuma ruled SA as his own fiefdom Zuma and the SSA even tried to stop Ramaphosa's bid for ANC president.The report is in the public domain...everyone can access it. Zuma must come clean on the murders of refugees in camps in exile...he was the head of intelligence. Ramathlodi gave a very intensive testimony here at the Commission about it. "Zuma ruled one faction of the ANC I don't I block those who insult me...not worth the effort to address them The ANC destroyed the country and must fall.Here some people think I am a propagandist...lol @Derek Main dont entertain populists You are right

makhosi nobhatyi,Eish guys I have out of office for while Zuma’s reply on intelligence reports recommendation he is implicated I wonder why intelligence didn’t investigate anything during his tenure 😳😳😳 "Zizojika izinto Ramaphosa uzophatha ungakhali mntwana nam it is his time to clean up and make Anc and the country dignity has mandated to perform that "@magda Seguin I agreed with you At Songezo nqonji it is a painful one because Zuma as the president hide only Ramaphosa and Piyega who was criticized even blamed but president Zuma escaped from criticism We must all rally behind Ramaphosa "He is defending the country from thieves
Songezo Nqonji,Ijst feel sory for president Ramaphosa because he must do the damage control nw I disagree at Derek as u said he was deputy so he was restricted u can not fight ur boss @ Mzalwane Mzala i heard u
Mzalwane Mzala,President Ramaphosa leads the renewal of both the ANC and the state. Lead us Ramaphosa @Songezo Nqonji Don't try to reason with other people as they are not prepared to consider sense because they have a clear agenda. @makhosi nobhatyi They see Ramaphosa as a threat to their political fortunes and thus they target him. Ramaphosa is fixing SARS He was in business nine years ago. At least read if you are to be an effective propagandist. @Derek Main Stop lying. Kgalema Motlanthe was the deputy president of both the country and the ANC then. Ramaphosa became a deputy state president close to five years ago. Do you know the difference between a state and a party?
