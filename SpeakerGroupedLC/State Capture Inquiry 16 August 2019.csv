Just like the PP who investigated them....getting fax numbers wrong. the the the the....... @Kabelo Katjedi Some of the jobs we are short of are lying wasted under incompetent functioneries like bo Thabethe here and our PP.
Kabelo Katjedi,Just hope today he will make sense uself how they even got the position as Director generals. Thats why our state entities always run at a loss "Lorraine i do agree with Zuma on that one "Norman i ws so surprised 2 hear that our PP got everything missed up messed up Im suspicious that their qualification might have been bought via a cup of coffee at mag &bean while we complain about unemployed graduates. Thats why the ANC believe in hiring this old useless people "This guy ws nt supposed to be released in jail "He wnt  "The state should just sell every property belongs 2 this crooks "Gerber im personally watching it 2 witness the outcomes and hear whos implicated so that i can take my vote somewhere else.They will b telling us that media ws exaggerating

Thabo Molefe,This here is a pathological liar!! Tjerrrrrr!!!
JS Bach,Oh pleeeeease man! What a load of rubbish!! I think Parmalat etc should come before the commission. I think their story would be different. You steal the money man!!! Zondo sees right through you. Ouch......now he realises he is stuck @Reward Mushayabasa for sure. What is the cost of lies? "What is the cost of lies? It's not that we'll mistake them for the truth. The real danger is that if we hear enough lies @Wilson Hishono Yes! We are always paying. You've never done what? @mafuta 😂😂 Integrity.......he lacks integrity. SAY IT!~!!!!!! "Speak
Ashish Kapoor,who r these person
Nadia botha,"my question is whether anyone will be prosecuted from these proceedings Millions stolen and our babies are sleeping in the street and dying. And yet we vote the same people into power who have failed us because of nostalgic views. @rosalind gerber you dont understand what i was trying to bring across. I am wondering whether or not there will be prosecutions otherwise what was the purpose other than exposure of corruption @Moshoeu Mabusela we as are limited to choices of one corrupt to the other. Maybe if they allowed independent candidates running.We will have honest people not bought by corporations or wealthy people @Moshoeu Mabusela we all hope to find genuine people in the struggling country of ours. My child is of mixed culture and I pray everyday she will not be treated unfairly because of it
isaac inkoom,Nadia Botha youre 100% right
rosalind gerber,"if the commission is a waste of time Former Free State agriculture department head Peter Thabethe "Lets hope that something does come of the commission "Thanks Nadia @Moshoeu Mabusela that is a big generalization @Moshoeu Mabusela I really hope that you meet more people who are not like that. We are here. Most of my high school learners are not white and I promote and hope for their success. Zondo speak - Fissures (features) "It is such a pity that many black professionals @I Am Free - agreed - Cape secession makes sense - what about KZN?
Zama Kubheka,morning ppl...who is the criminal in question today?
Moshoeu Mabusela,@Nadia botha Yes we vote for them because we had it with apartheid people. we do want to go back there with the DA or FFPLUS. @ I Am Free. The taught their descendents that some people are either garden boys or kitchen girls. So their sons and daughters know us as slaves. @ I Am Free. evidence is everywhere in this country. I did not know ppl can be this ignorant of reality. @rosalind gerber They keep on enjoying the services of slavery at the expense of the poor. They think the are more important than others. @rosalind gerber I hope so either. Check the competition commission report on data must fall and bank charges. include insurance companies on shares. @I Am FreeCheck Check the competition commission report on data must fall and bank charges. include insurance companies on shares "@Derek Main your to angry to engage in meaningful discussion. pray for your anger to go @I Am Free. I am not talking about who is working is out of the question. am talking about stealing related to big businesses.

psiklops71,may i ask what this about thanks
Christy,This protocol oke doesn't know what suspended is. You are still employed when suspended wena When will Ace feature in this commission guys? "Nceba Duma dead cows
Nceba Duma,"true @abe molefe. we need to be bold as south africans blacks in particular this is as a direct results of codesa1& 2. set up by white ppl and their cronies. after you christy...you have to account all the the land that is viable for farming was stolen by white ppl. so Ace had no option. Amandla..... they need to bring back our land and stop this mickey mouse commission yes ace and his cronies please. Mawubuye! "maybe not JBrown. maybe its my view lets end it Reven. I agree CR17 is the last hope for the white elite in this country. Ace will crush Zuidland here we are not tallking about trips to overseas India. we are talking about our land chief and Mr Magashule is Ace. why we have to account about issues of kand in this day and age issues of land Terrorism and Corruption. these two concepts are problematic they are always used by colonial forces to defocus our ppl on a genuine struggle
Musawenkosi Nxumalo,ANC is corrupt and their the ones who are capturing the state with their indians and white friends.. and thuma mina won't deal with unemployment he is a business man.. and everyone is scared of ANC @liz..the gudge is also ANC like of the SA gudges.
J Brown,didn't the researcher say Vrede was not a viable place for dairy farms that was why dairy farms were closing down in the free state so blame the whites for stealing money from estina? and give it to Ace and his cronies maybe you are one crony I agree. they must comment
Dmitry Nikashin,"Larger corporate farms have more of a direct path to the grocery store than the smaller farms no one wants to deal with small farmers let alone emerging farmers because it becomes too expensive and complicated
makhosi nobhatyi,"This man is lying now He is covering up his decision to jump to India @ Buyiswa Mnyani . Surely these companies would be very willing to assist these poor people Where is the money now with that decision you took sir Thabethe Ace Magashule mind is working on this man This not kfc I would love to see these companies come to clarify this matter did this approach them or not? "@ Thandeka Ngidi she is tired of this man coz he is lying "How can you wrote something when you asked to explain to accuse bantu education what is that? Bantu education produces more competent people such DCJ This docs from court mr Thabethe "😃😃😂😃 @ Buyiswa Mnyani no these madalaz must vacate the position allow Youth  "@ Buyiswa Mnyani I see "@ Buyiswa Mnyani kubekwa abantu abazokwazi ukuxoka 😃😃😂 but Ace Magashule yena akazomelana nale mibuzo

Aussie Gypsy,india? lol. try Africa
Born free,The curry and buffalo milk is better there. I don't see how colonialism has anything to do with going to India to learn about dairy farming. @I Am Free... Yes There is more respect for Chairman Zondo and he keeps order. Parliament is a joke there is no order especially with the delinquents.. the EFF Everytime the EFF open their mouths.. it costs them money 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Let's hope the army is well prepared. 🤣🤣 When has Zuma been invited back to give his testimony?? The EFF are delinquents. What are you these features that differ to the features in SA?? EFF stole from VBS which is a civil servants pension fund Kenya knows from experience that it needs white farmers and Investment . Only dedicated Teachers Yip all big businesses are transferring their money offshore and many have closed their branches. I sense the witness is protecting Ace Magashule.
Jacqui Baumgardt,oh my golly-gosh-gee. you can't put something into force BEFORE the agreement is signed
Melor Hadebe,I wish i have these reference bundles HH something theyre taking about 😟 my queen too @Ryan Smith

Pheladi Lamola,DCJ must have been a teacher in his previous life. 😀😀 @Ewald Kruger. I don't have even an ounce of his patience. Bedaar Ryan😀 We have another Zuma here. Not easy to find pages. This is how they've been treating the people of Free State @jasper dougal. Now they're just extending the impunity to the whole of SA. Wow. Hello Bennie. Le kae Tlou? Re gona ngwanesho. @Bennie Lamola I don't have Facebook. Are you on Twitter?
Sergen_03,Hi Magda Seguin i loveyou you are so beautifall
Ewald Kruger,Correct. Special needs teacher by the looks of it 😀 @Pheladi Lamola ​DCJ must have been a teacher in his previous life. They had copyright on their model? 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 explain please @Innocent Zondi ​ She is Prejudiced. She is incompetent to handle this line of Questioning This bastad could have spilled the beans in one hour when he started his testimony and saved us all a lot of time and money.
Husby Mohapi,Ryan Smith you are not experienced into multiculturalism or non racialism culture
Mpho Maja,EFF gives some people nightmares
Derek Main,EFF are fascists @I Am Free howzit @Moshoeu Mabusela I have no problem with them holding big business to account. My problem is that they display fascist and racist tendencies. EFF are thugs and bullies. @aurelia nqeto No - they weren't and should be held to account if any evidence of that is forthcoming. But the ANC have taken corruption to a different level - they have perfected it. @Moshoeu Mabusela I'm not angry - just saying it like I see it. Sounds like you are looking for excuses not to engage. "@Pastor J As I said above @Pastor J Aaah - I see now. Sorry for the confusion. The Infogate was but one small case in which the corrupt were held to account. There was far more Nat government corruption that went unpunished.
jasper dougal,The wheels of justice grind so slowly in ZA How many lies do we have to listen to before Police come Knocking ? I think they should invite the public protector to come and explain her judgements This Guy is a hopeless liar! "He is such a terrible liar  "He could have confirmed the existence of the Company via the High Commission How stupid does he think ew are ?
Thulani Bukani,@Ryan that is what Cyril is supposed to be. but clearly thats a shambles too. I am free are you saying 12500 or even 17000 is too much to pay a mine worker? I am free thats not my question. I asked if you say 17000 is too much to pay a mine worker

Frank Peter,is this still crawling along? it seems some low lying beaurocrats did not get a fair share of the pie and have become whistleblowers
Ashne Hesselberg,"Aurelia nqeto apartheid was a crime against humanity; are u suggesting that if those thugs did what they did @Pastor J . Sorry if I got it wrong. Of course corruption existed. Far worse than what’s happening now. Pastor J what happened during apartheid was genocide @pastorJ agreed 👍🏻
Victory in Yahusha,This is so disappointing. Our leaders are failing us. What an HOD. Sure he was an HOD Hiding lies with lies over lies. "Shooooo thinking of other lies
Dylan Jacklin,After today's proceedings this guy must just walk himself into jail @Liz Profe *Estina "No problem... I'm sure he also doesn't know. ""Nor interested he he he""" NEVER So the whole department is and has always been slack @Remember Dzhombe fully agree With these guys still in their positions we need to restart all departments ASAP.

Dominic Przybylski,Our government is running on a very basic (inadequate autopilot). No point in employing people with integrity at high levels then. May as well just use anybody who can read regulations.
