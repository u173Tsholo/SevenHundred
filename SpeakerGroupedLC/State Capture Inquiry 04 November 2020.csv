Dan Brown,"Dudu hasn't got half of Kate's intellect or memory. Just a ""Kick Me"" complexion" "Dudu Going to plead the 5th "Dudu doesn't have petrol money I bet Money the Internet will be dropped because DUD hasn't paid Vodacom or MTN. She has told JZ how to do this on Skype and frustrate everyone. She's the Puppeteer Someone from the commission should be monitoring her on that side. I KNEW IT - DUDU's Bandwidth is DUD DUDU is heading to ORT ✈ You don't need to be a foretune teller to predict this was her strategy Number 1 Too Clever She deliberately didn't charge it yesterday and she will claim no other means of internet because she hasn't even got petrol money. She's being coached by her legal team and there's nothing anyone can do?? What do you say DCJ?? █▬█ █ ▀█▀ her with a warrant of arrest to appear Tell Dudu to sit back a bit she's scaring the kids and pets Virtual is BS - Yᵒᵘ Oᶰˡʸ Lᶤᵛᵉ Oᶰᶜᵉ Dudu Whats wrong with her health she got JZ disease??

It would have been easy to stage that to look like suicide. ⚖💤🔜 She is just wasting time... Stalingrad delays with irrellevant waffle She hasn't been asked a question and she's waxing lyrical SAA IS WHY YOU ARE HERE???? You have respect for no-one except your chommie JZ !! Dudu you are just making yourself look like a tottie! I suppose she wont answer questions about Eskom or JZ?? DCJ We like you but you are too soft. Kate Take over Girl 🌹 "Kate Hofmeyr holds BA (Hons) "She has appeared in the Constitutional Court I agree Kate is sexy when she's on a roll. JZ will be in tears if he met someone with KK's expertise She is already so predjudiced it doesn't matter her name is MUD anyway in this country. Kwinana's name is MUD already anyway

She also says she can't find her earphones... The commission must make sure that this does not happen again. The commission should provide a facility/s. Otherwise this will happen again with no.1 The commission should have arranged the nearest court for her to appear in and deliver her testimony through devices provided by the commission to ensure reliable connectivity. This is embarrassing. How odd? All of a sudden I just feel comfortable of calling all these people IMIGODOYI as Mbeki put it.. She is hot 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Ryan b,Let's go.. could this discussion not have happened beforehand...? #stalingrad tactics she just got off the phone with uBaba DCJ cancel the day... if she wants to behave like this.. let the hawks arrest her and have her day in court the commission evidence leaders are all prepared for this because dali mpofu raised these arguments on behalf of he's client. so he just admitted.. dudu is in self isolation so not to be arrested by hawks
Lesley Gove,Just heard she is going to remain silent as her testimony might implement criminality. Unfortunately Judge Zondo is letting them dictate to the commission.She should be there in person. This is far above these such persons seated here.Dudu can't make sense of this nor do her lawyers.Go Kate. Why did the judge not apply this? Kate has been left to educate us. When u r guilty it takes u so long to try to convince the other person.The devil gets at the throat. Thats why she is hiding.Hawks are everywhere. This is why she should be present at Commission.Covid is all a cover up.sis
Katlego Mametja,here we go! "looking at her glasses

Bavuyile Melane,There was something about Covid19 concerning Dudu that I heard on the News this morning She looks like a goat on camera now. She will definitely switch off the camera when a hard question is asked """I don't see Miss Myeni Now""....there she goes....""Miss Myen iahs lost bandwith"" DO YOU SEE!" SOMEONE PLIZ GO TO HER HOUSE AND MONITOR HER USE PF THE LATPTOP COZ SURELY HSE GOT A LAPTOP. @Sjay Mabaso SHE WILL DO THAT ON PURPOSE OH THERE SHE IS I LIKE MISS HOFMEYER AND SHE HANDLED YESTERDAY """YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION IS UNSTABLE""" HEHEEE HAI I WONDER WHAT WILL BE THE END KEEP THE LAPTOP CHARGED MISS MYENI SHE MIGHT CRY AND SHUT THE LAPTOP THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THIS COVID EXPOSURE. SHE WAS TRYNG A ZUMA TRICK THAT DID NIT WORK THE ATTORNEY MUST SHUT UP SOMEONE PLIZ CHASE THOSE LAWYERS OUT KICK THEM OUT COMPLETELY NO SMS DURING THE COMMISSION DISTRACTIONS SHUT THEM UP She doesn't wanna ansa questions. This woman has been advised by Zuma I asume. She knows that she made many mistakes in SAA. I hate her now. What about the money she recieved This woman is trying to run and not answer questions. trust me Julius Malema will talk about this. She is moving the laptop and pretending like she cant here anything. She deliberately exposed herself to Covid19 so that she will do this from home.

Luthando Xhamlayo,Is there someone in the room with Dudu Myeni just to ensure that she doesn't deliberately temper with connections Adjourn until? I am a bit disappponted in DCJ Zondo. This is a bit enbarrassing. He should have known about the Right to Silence and the Priviledge granted by the Commission. Now he is being schooled by Kate So he is not basing this on any law! Maybe she has been arrested already

Nolwazi,I don't think she's reading. She has the exhibits (affidavit) in front of her. If she's not incriminating herself then there's nothing to say at this Commission. @johannes mailula ANC is made up of members. They can't even find her because her 'phone is off' Dudu has learned from ubaba ka Duduzane So why is she here? Dudu is going to answer every question with privilege.

Karabo T,"Sadly Precedence is now set for Zuma to do same unfortunately
SD Gudunkomo,ALL Riiiise! honestly I think Dudu is right not to answer any questions before the commission because her case is already in court Zinhle no she is not my mother.why you asking? Zinhle that is because what she's gonna say here won't help her anyway.and the public is not prepared to listen to her side of the story.all they ( commission and some certain people) want is the way ...they way to arrest her no matter what evidence she's putting before the commission. Her case is now beyond the clearing of her name. Cristal clear Ya she's got a brilliant counsel and Gordan exercise the privilege why she's referring to the judgement took place before 1994.? Even if Dudu can answer some question but it's possible that she will refuse most of the questions which would then be the waste of time not enough Kate.not enough Thabo she prepared for this because she knew it before hand remember?
Philip Herring,Contempt writ large.
ralitza Gawises,Can Talent can speak at least?😁🙄😂 Banele Masuku🤣🤣🤣
Mandla Mlambo,aaah
Lerato Moleke,Yhoo Raymond and his million adjournments
Thozamile Yapi,🙄🙄🙄 Then why you here? we are now hearing arguments ? That is perhaps the main reason she is not at the commission. hehehe
MonaM,basically what DCJ is trying to say in a 'nice way to Ms Myeni this strategy didn't work before. Mokhesi & Smith used it but they were arrested and charged criminally anyway🤪🤪
Given Malange,🤦‍♂😠
André du Plessis,so the kid gloves are out again remember when dudu didnt have money to get to the state capture hearing?
Aubrey De Bliquy,Dare anyone question DCJ's sincerity and faithfulness to law. I read of his life and career. A fine man of integrity and honour. Many of our independent judiciary are people of integrity and a credit to us all and South Africa can be collectively grateful we a are so blessed. I still say a thriving young democracy. The glass is half full. "And frankly We have everything we need and everything the world wants under our feet. All we need is the heart and the will and the aloha that will make that happen. I do not judge this woman without hearing her story and neither should anyone. "Nobody is saying this isn't messed up. It's a train smash I think that forex thing was another way to get money abroad but we'l have to wait and see. "DCJ wishes to assist in protecting her rights and rightly so . We are ruled by law "Don't forget everyone of these people culd have been you or I or our brother or sister or child DCJ is helping them combine the witnesses rights and the goal of the commission. @melds melds How would you feel if somebody you loved had made a mistake? Your daughter or son or sibling? cool idea @Salty Crack Its 2020 we can reflect ranked choice will of the people which will help us to know and love one another at the same time... As long as we are dreaming... Life is the art of the possible. "Welcome to SABC cuz. We preparing vetkoek here "@getfreewifi South Africa I love your handle. Mine is @GetfreeElectricity SouthAfrica... It was either that or land "@getfreewifi South Africa Awesome Imagine if you were in her situation. It could happen to anyone that a mistake of circumstances forces you to defend yoursel. I pray for her. Could be my sister. I respect her choice. Let her reply to questions in writing. Her rights are most important. We measure ourselves as a civilization in the way we treat the weakest among us. OK She does not trust the system. I understand where she comes from. Its for us to protect her from the injustice of a lynch mob mentality. We are ruled by our consensus law and not by the jungle. Perfectly reasonable. Can we put this fine lady in our great courts. She is a credit to our great law. OK so the point is her right to silence is not a blank cheque to remain silent. We measure our civilization by the way we treat the weakest among us. @MIKE DURBAN Why huge punishment? I prefer just punishment.

Siyabonga-ka-Phindile Yonzi,Commissions unlike courts they are not seeking to convict anyone hence this approach
Clive White,Today is a waste of public money.
Francoise Phillips,The commission must be furnished with proof of her confirmed Covid status and confirmation from her doctor. She is lying to the commission. Dudu Myeni wasting even more of South Africa's money with this fake Covid scare to evade justice. "Agreed @Norman Mohakala Dudu the Delinquent. An honest person who has committed no crime would not have a problem with answering all the commission's questions. She is definitely reading from a document given to her by her lawyers. It really is time to arrest this crook now. "The RET 'collective decision' the ANC throws at robbed citizens to evade criminal guilt. In that case the entire ANC must be collectively charged of corruption @Naledi Baron 'radical economic transformation' a lie the Zuma thieves use to steal from the poor and enrich themselves. "Dudu Myeni has basically confirmed to the nation that she is guilty of theft Kate and Seleka are just the best advocates.

Xolani Mshengu,The commission isdued a supeona knowing the court status...and Dudu indicated this in her affidavit as the learned counsel Hofmeyer attested in her opening....so who is really at fault here? @Yolo More...not at all...but if a matter is before court it is legally not advisable to talk about it publicly she is clouding the argument....basically the DCJ must make a ruling. We do not need such a long lecture.
Thabiso Ramasike,Let them bring the factcakes sister. She doesn't know about the right to remain silent!! There we go with the silence... Mthiyane is a clan name for the Zondos.. The Kate Boss!!
