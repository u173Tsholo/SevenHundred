Mr Green,What's happening here?
Wildthing,"The @Duduzane_Zuma account was originally called “Bantukazi Biko” part of a lawyers studies include accounting. now judge will ask why she did not question the certificate. she is the head she is niw explaining how they moved the money out through the systems in small amounts trying to be arrogant judge going to get upset soon. ha ha nailed love it when a black lady with brains schools a Zupta student at the end of the day she is CFO the buck stops with her someone must start to have her accountant (CA) removed never to hold the position ever again. when she comes out of jail. from who did it come from ha ha who asked her looking at the back of the Chair lady. it looks like a court case against Ninjas. and with head scaffs on. its the dry fruitb she never ticked anything Then you have a break down at this point the hole is so deep she is throwing the sad out above her head. the sides will start to cave in soon. nailed for not reporting. hawks should be waiting with silver bracelets You CFO its your job ha ha back to the policy's her role: Chief Financial officer. she must count every cent. and know where it was used. judge is cross now They a bunch of Zupra crooks because she was instructed an Indian company how sad ANC #VoetsekANC Friday now a everyday thing $10 M just for studies. but the farmers had already said that the milk thing would not work. failed from the start. This is money laundering too. now trying to make the rules she forgot her sunglasses 🕶 at home this crook. Judge is burning inside bang HOD is head pin now she is sweeting now Big question is what is the reportbof the PP about. as it did not cover this. public should now request the removal of PP as a delinquent and not fit to hold her job. backing the crooks not country she is explaining how they stole. maybe same style used for PPe "The stealing machine R330 Million in OFS. Billions in SAA "Limpopo squeezing for the name of Ace trying to blame the dead ha ha they have Mrs Fouries testimonial ha ha you displaying it now. bully you are CFO ha ha 😂🤣 he send me she is part of mafia and help set up the path for the money to get moved. she hide so much from others. total Bully and abuse of position. The reason was you know where the money was going. Vreda was a hoax set up R330 Million. 80% of South Africans will never earn anything near that in all there lives must dig up her history in Limpopo where was there investment. :oops::oops: Zupta defence This Sopie can go on all night she brought a bulldozer to try cover up the hole ha ha watch how fast she answers now all planned she is still the CFO and needed to approve it all "You can see this is a South African lawyer she really likes KFC 🍗 💀 Judge must think back to the policy's she read out earlier she likes passing the responsibilities. First the a poor lady not hear anymore and now the other managers Judge must go in for the kill. Best point made by Judge. Tax payers money used correctly. thats all your money they stole. They don't have R30 million or R330 Million. To India ask her why the meeting was in a hotel "ha ha Indian experts. Gupta 1 Judge has fallen asleep he is snooring ha ha project manager has no say over money. she runs the project and CFO approves. Twitter going to go mad now. I thougb Judge would ask the Hawks to take ovet. yes yes

Sal SA,in terms of generally accepted accounting practice it is required to correctly reflect an expense eg Estina Project. Sundry is for minimal expenses. This is hiding the purpose of payment @Gala Thank u brother This one only uses signing number and press Enter button to pay. Paras was BIG like Steinhoff. Is that what u saying CFO should have done a financial due diligence This was a Gupta plan You didn't do your job. Period Especially for small province like Free State $5m is enormous. "$5m could have provided housing @Luthando whatever u saying maybe I agree @Luthando keep it clean bro @Luthando thank you kindly For a CFO she accepts too many things without interrogating them from a financial risk perspective "Please don't say HONESTLY again Looking at Gupta notes Thats the answer I got from Gupta's. Its not CFO role to worry about investment potential and job creation. So she doesn't do her actual job @Valencia she said she arranged tampons lol But u the CFO its not your job Its a joke Paras was already sourced. Aha She's says WE. You lost Rmillions mam Shes going down kicking and screaming @Naledi you 100% correct She is not fit and proper to be employed by Taxpayers Resumes @ 17h20 Finishing at 6pm with Ms CFO The entire ANC leadership should be suspended after all the shenanigans For payments there must be an approval to pay and then processing takes place By cash she means available funds Is Revenue Fund same as Father Xmas But u should have said it was not budgeted for. Stick to what u said and did. She is highly charged now Liar liar pants on fire 🔥 MEC involvement is pressure n therefore interference How much did you receive from Gupta's and did u attend the wedding that u paid for? is she a Gupta attorney? Score? Tnx Patrick Very well quoting regulations but in reality not following same Silence is condonement - bull GN Valencia This line of questioning was a real mess @Cruda u deserve a promotion up the ranks:goodvibes:

Nobuhle Jara,Key words...' WAS GOING TO'? there was no investment my dear. You are digging your own grave. you can't justify a R30m deviation for something that was not in place I sense frustration in the Chairs voice...ku rough. It was your own thing you could have saved 30 mins and said yes it was your own thing from the beginning so you confidently deviated knowingly to plead non compliance instead of contravening the law.

Frik De Villiers,I love this Advocate. She is a superstar. Clever and well prepared. Dlamini is a big embarrassment to our civil servants. Ace must be very nervous. Dlamini does not even understand the meaning of integrity Ace is definitely going to be marginalized in the ANC. Ace may not be mentioned by name but his signature hangs over every process. Signature like shadow Dlamini disgraced herself with these blatant lies.
