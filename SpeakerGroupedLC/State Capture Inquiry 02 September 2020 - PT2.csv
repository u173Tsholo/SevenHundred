This is money laundering too. now trying to make the rules she forgot her sunglasses üï∂ at home this crook. Judge is burning inside bang HOD is head pin now she is sweeting now Big question is what is the reportbof the PP about. as it did not cover this. public should now request the removal of PP as a delinquent and not fit to hold her job. backing the crooks not country she is explaining how they stole. maybe same style used for PPe "The stealing machine R330 Million in OFS.
