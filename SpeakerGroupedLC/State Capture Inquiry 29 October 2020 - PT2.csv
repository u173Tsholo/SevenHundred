Peter,Colonel Venter is being fried like eggs by Julius Malema's legal representative
bongile sango,@Peter that Colonel seemed to be in trouble our money was just flowing carelessly here🙄🤷‍♂️ hoping this one is not going to cry @zip reeper 😂😂😂😂😂
stanley mhlana,It is time that we see action from the commission we the people of SA we will be pleased if we see people starting to wear orange overalls. guys who is this Piet Vast can anybody inform me why is he important?
Lee D. Hendrix,...Skin is the largest organ of a body. The Constitution of persons within their Minds / Brain.. controls actions as physical articulation. Stupidity; is taking Reality hostage to suit one's self. "NOTE; those young people(EFF) are disrespected by efforts of ignorant adults ...I'M BETTER THAN YOU is what? "...Brainwashing others is a Science for servitude ".Law is.. rules created enforceable  ...Zondo may well be presiding over the greatest looting scheme in the History of the world. "...Zuma's attorneys have to expres a defence  "..@ zip reeper; women have rights too . ...ANC is the continuation of Apartheid by the laws of colonist who needed food and lodging near the gold mines and precious metals.
Naomi van Tonder,malemas eggs must be fried for a change. his suporters is destroying and messing up again outside the court. job creation I suppose. one messes and one picks up etc etc
Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ,hi again..✋🏽 I was watching the malema hearing... I noticed some odd stuff there "..for example "..😎there's lot off loopholes there. ( which I won't get into) ..also col Venter is a worker "...I would like "..one observation ..so the claim was he was blocking the way. "🤔 But private schools could be the reason for this ..no I'm from South Africa ..just found myself in the right place..in the wrong time. 😅🙏🏽 pray for SAA no im not a goat. I'll hold you to slander "But "though keep in mind "tell me something....did malemas farm get taken away 🤔 Tough education is not a show off quality - but off status 🤔 what our philosophers think about this ganging up on minorities ..again "..this cult welldone to the art community of SA. get well soon Cyril ...Cyril ..Cyril "Btw "*Adams calendar is the south African Stonehenge please don't cry.. it upset me "...I watch how goodnight 😴
Heather Durr,@Peter @bongile Laurance wrestling in the dirt where he loves it best-that is why Malema has had him as his lawyer for 10 years @Tommygun HUH! @Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ 'A Dutch Person? @Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ India has 1 billion people-not surprising GOAT means Greatest of all Time -Like Federer in Tennis 3 November... @Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ It predates the so called 'Bantu' settlements there by some 75000 years-they have yet to discover who constructed it-it is a calendar spread over thousands of miles. @zip reeper ex wife's sister that is so far removed-what is the scandal there unless Zondo was married at the time-he has 2 kids a son and daughter These Afrikaans women are so competent and accomplished "@Cerebis @Paul Buchel I know She is sharp this one-impressive and sneaky :0:) @Bennie Deysel America the land of the MAGAotts Didn't that Psychopath say that he had destroyed ISIS 100% ISIS is back-hope they did not hear yo talking about Mr Laher the other day @Mzalwane Mzala The majority of the people have chosen them @Louis C murdered 3 women as I recall @Louis C I was there when those concrete dustbins exploded in the middle of the city and the car bomb in Pretoria and the guy who was executed for the station bomb "@Salmaan Abrahams Botswana Declare war on America /Britain/ Russia/ China and become a colony again 🙂 I never vote-the last time was the referendum-why bother if the ANC always wins. Many whites feel the same and I am sure the people of colour dont care if we do or dont. The numbers are so against us in term of population 80% Black and growing. We will be the most populated and youngest continent by 2030 due to the growing size of families This lady would be a GREAT EVIDENCE LEADER @Cerebis Well the royal family has ruled since 1400AD @Mzalwane Mzala That is a very interesting statistic. Thank you ! 🙂 @Cerebis If only😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 "@Cerebis There were a few great queens "@Nico Koert Jesus was a Jew. He would be the same skin colour as the Jews are. Moses was Egyptian "Generally @RduP It a Bi-Polar thing-keeps me safe (and them too probably-hmmm Never thought of that) but its why I am so bright and humble ... @Bill West Read what I wrote-I dont even trust the sun to come up Hot Mile Alert HOT MIKE ALERT "@Bill West I am for kindness HOT MIKE GAAAAAAAAAAH DCJ is CAPTURED....... Can she examine Zuma loooooooooooooooooooooooool @Mzalwane Mzala One can hope 🙂
Hennie Stander,"NO MASKS 
Tommygun,more trumped up charges against employees doing their job too well.. Illiteracy is the path taken by those whove had a decent education denied them and their parents. Jeremy Cronins too hard core for ANC @Heather Durr ANC seems like play play socialism compared to the likes of Cronin or Ex Turock great and clear witness I do hope we get to hear from Mr Tshepe No one in the past got to talk about the fairness of history coz they was dead
Fred Desrosiers,"@Lee D. Hendrix "@Piet Vast "@Piet Vast
James Godloza Godloza,Mr K that would be like mixing water with oil not to his defense but he had an affrikaner lawyer in his defense for me his stance represents double standards "I'm sorry to say agreed Celibis sorry I'm like the Chair today (Cerebis) it always bothers me that well educated people were led to corruption by a completely an uneducated old fool Zuma I would not want to study and become an accountant yet be told by a grade 5 how to count Louis and the witness look exactly like Mr Miyagi @Louis:washhands: were are you now Mr K same here Mr Abraham's
Sekgololo Johannes,Malema is just one angry and racist dude "today he has his life on the line total double standards speak for the poor? while he himself is not poor? dangerous fool i guess Malema intends to argue that he had credentials as if that explains why he assaulted a police officer. indeed. he must face the law "Lakhan u can play with your friends Malema is just full of hatred.
Minnib Prince,I agree Johannes urge???? a man must eat:virtualhug:
FieliesSA,What did I miss? Anything special?
Louis C,Just remembered that @Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ is a Goat non de plume "@Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Goat  "Wax on @James Godloza Godloza We need a Karate kid Brother😊 Cyril unveiled a 9M statue of O R!

Cerebis,L&T? I prefer G&T 8th December cannot come soon enough. Piet has got a vast amount to say? @Ghost Mapetla Lucifer is to scared to go to Lootfree House. ALL lives matter. @Piet Vast Hmmm.....my forefathers came from Heidelberg Germany. We had a coalition government and De Klerk sunk it to be with his Greek Tragedy. @Bennie Deysel Haha....I don't think you will get much....We are totally bankrupt. "England/UK is currently being ruled by a Queen? For many @Heather Durr Jip true! There were many Kings before unification. Some Kings also chopped off the heads of their wives? Hehe....Very funny comment Salty. @Heather Durr King Henry the Eight ?? "King Henry VIII @Heather Durr Agree. "King Henry VIII Or your house will be burnt down? braai Me too "@Heather Durr Like in the song O Lord @Bill West :yougotthis::yougotthis::washhands::washhands::goodvibes::goodvibes: DCJ needs some tea and cookies? "No to Federer Rubbish Heather......by whom nogal? "@Heather Durr Ooops....sorry
Moonchild,Yes for sure - they sow racial hatred & division in this country instead of working together to try & uplift all. Money is a powerful aphrodisiac @Lee D. Hendrix - without doubt! @Minnib Prince - is that why Zuma is claiming conflict of interest & they are trying to get Zondo to recuse himself? Another deflection by corrupt Zuma to avoid the Commission. @LionView - what absolute nonsense. Stop spreading fake news @Bennie Deysel 🤣😂😅 @Thokozile Mokoenanyana - too true 👌
zip reeper,He pays money like it grows on trees Just does what hes told ha ha "@nelson makwala ... useless functionary He had urgent business with that lady "She bought house "@Lee D. Hendrix If Zondo was messing round with Zuma's ex-wife sister "@Minnib Prince ... Still piet's been blocked "@Mike Moja ... its rather convoluted @bongile sango ... Ask her for a dance at the office Xmas party Why doesnt Kennedy stand next to Zondo then the witness doesnt have to swivel her head nonstop

Mzalwane Mzala,Robert Mcbride is a hero of those who were oppressed. ANC is the people's choice @Heather Durr Fact Robert Mcbride is still doing very well. @Bill West De Klerk decided against a system where a racialised minority vote so don't accuse hi of other thigs. About 20% of those South Africans who voted in 2019 chose the DA. About 10.8% of those South Africans who voted in 2019 chose the EFF. South Africans built this country The Cape Party could not secure even a seat in the Cape in 2019. "@Salmaan Abrahams With your additional vote that will put them at 9332 votes i the Western Cape while the biggest party in that province No secession without the ANC in the other 8 provinces. Elections and a referendum tend to be more reliable tests of sentiment otherwise we will all think that our friends represent the people's sentiment. @Heather Durr I would encourage you to vote for whoever represent your interests. After the 2016 local government elections there was hope that the ANC can be removed from power. What intervened since then? The 55% majority that is the women voters also vote for different parties. In 2019 57% of those who voted were women. The secret is out! Zondo had a child with a sister of one of Zuma's wives (Timeslive). Zuma is being silly. No reason for the recusal of the DCJ I do not engage in discussions about the race of Jesus as it is not important to me. Really? @Bill West is against universal suffrage. I watched the Julius Malema/ Ndlozi case and I find myself on the side of the policeman. I have learnt not to judge people according to a racial group that they belong to. I have also learnt that people who praise you on one thing will condemn you on the other as it suits their interests. @Xolani J Masemula The history of the ANC from 1969 to 1977 has something to teach on that. And ended with the land Exactly @Xolani J Masemula @Aubrey De Bliquy ❤ VR laser was the bomb!

Salmaan Abrahams,To be honest I don’t know who to vote in the next election I’m voting for the cape party so we can have secession "We do not have one successful province under them  We need each province to be independent ( sovereign independence) DA will have to deal with the growing sentiments of the ppl about breaking away from SA @mzwala Nee ; everyone will need a visa :elbowcough: And we will not allow u upcountry oaks in We will give u a visit visa for 7 days only Stealing is not the issue @nico Stealing and crippling the state is ...stealing and bankrupting SOEs are the problems True @mzwal
