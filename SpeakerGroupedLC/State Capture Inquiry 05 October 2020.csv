Xolani J Masemula,Who's in the Hot Seat? Who's chewin here? "Mapha "@Blake "Who was crossing Cedrick last week? he was the worst "yes @Yolo "@Mike Clark "but at least Notshe got Cedrick nicely with the idea of getting him to solidify his statement with regards to whether or not Agrizzi was actually in that meeting "What was he fixing? the papers 😆😆😆😆@Elvis Malakoane "Miss Mbanjwa be up like ""The evidence presented about my client having to 'enlighten'
Jenny Whitewaves,morning all @Elvis Malakoane @rohan barnard Morning @ALTA hi the real question DCJ is asking is exactly when did you forst become corrupt first This one will be hard to catch DCJ memory is amazing Check the travel agents who paid his air fare all over the country The ones who were Bossa and Rugby board travel agents Have we heard about the water board before/ Needed a investigation that could be 100% certain to make the findings wanted The fireworks will come much late the adv is just chipping away bit by bit when the witness feels he has won then ......... @Eddie Reddy or was Dudu following his instructions to achieve her objectives She instructed he found the way she did what he told her @Eddie Reddy I agree he was the brains she the evil wisher I also question how much she instructed JZ @rohan barnard not sure he's bright enough for the fine detail planning He was able to set out the objectives but not clever enough for the exact hows She is definately deep in the mire but I don't think JZ is a detals man just board objectives as set out by the curry men details sorry Curry men == the Guptas OK
John-Tom Cavard,Anyone know if Adv. Maleka is still part of the Commission's legal team
Elvis Malakoane,anybody I know here in This joint Rohan Barnard voel better Dankie sounds like this chap is also a corruption enabler Mthokozisi Molefe Only court can determine whether he is going to jail or not opinion is irrelevant at this stage "Rohan Barnard true if had that memory I would be pleased ALTA I will during tea break madam "walking behind her fixing problems makhosi nobhatyi he is a conman Blake Yogi But looks like they have some bombs lined up for him Blake Yogi And he looks thorough and he aim the bullet at the right spot ALTA Carl niehaus will do anything for money including lying about his Mom Mike Clark this guys are cut from the same cloth and DUDU and nomvula mothers Theresa of their club He was a powerful figure in the institution but he was not even on the organogram I can't recall even if I recall I forgot and can't remember. So he is on ANC memory stick I don't know Mike Clark yes must be taken to police station now He is a fraudster Yolo more true he must allow him to finish him off Mbuso Ndlovu @ You have a sense of humor I must tell you But not literally spill the beans Mnr He says DUDU was jovial with President How else would they be given Talent was born "Talk son Linda I Moyo I love the vertical part of it "Mike Jones so not vertical anymore Rohan Barnard I have checked both vertical and horizontal and I come to same conclusion Rohan Barnard 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Mfundo 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Khanyi ageGracefully not much but this fellow is spilling the beans naturally no pressure Mfundo this people like deflecting Zuma is a corrupt mess full stop. when I see trolling people here. it tells if stupidy can be a pandemic they would quarantined at level 5 regulation today we are at 4.1k today so there is huge interest on the matter Mfundo he does not believe game is over Zuma is not even associating with other former presidents and he not invited anywere he is a scumbag

If she doesnt end up in orange I will know that the NPA/SAPS are properly captured. @Xolani J Masemula I watched in fascination-what a liar-its no suprise big Zuma fan he too should be arrested with Smith.He was in the sham committee that defended Zuma in his theft for his compound. Still trying figure out why chat line sometimes switched off anyone with any thoughts @Mbuso Ndlovu so right & now the ANC is spending R34bn on a new project in Tswana- can u imagin the thieving that will take place - the ANC NEC and cadres must be licking thier lips in anticipation. @Morongwa Mmolotsi morning @Tshepiso Mbebuwa I agree this guy is starting to make my skin itch!!!! "@Blake Yogi How much did this guy get paid as the ""fixer""" "@Blake Yogi R180k for f' all @Elvis Malakoane which is why he so at home in the ANC Lootfreely House HQ "@Andrew Mboweni Pres.

joyce tendai Zvavareyi,"someone chewing on this forum no more political power.... no where to hide... evidence appears to come thick and fast! Seleka is sound. you would probably perform likewise. I like the way he makes his submissions give him a chance he will expose the truth for you. he is thorough as far as I follow his work. the chair is not sending anyone to jail. it is ones evidence or others that has left them to exposed! he is just doing what he has to do. SALUTE thank you Ayanda why would you say leave other people out Zuma and Dudu your time's up hahahaha Molefe why would you say that. are there sacred cows? if found complicit why would he not be prosecuted as others Gerber hahahaha Makua so it's three pipo
Phakamile Khuzwayo,it's molele inyanga that is chewing if apartheid government was more corrupt but not to their own ppl like what is anc doing to us
Mzalwane Mzala,Where are those who said we will never see arrests that are linked to testimonies in this commission? @Owen Nyilika As long as you admit to your mistake. @Andre Gerber I agree @bruinman Paarl is my home The EFF was correct in referring to her as Dudu Myeni-Zuma. She was the real 'First Lady' and the 'Prime Minister' Miss Mbanjwa belongs in the EFF @Sal SA Looters shout a lot about ideology and politics but they only care about money and collaborate with anyone who helps them in their looting mission. A KZN Captain hands himself in for 2010 World Cup corruption. No more impunity! What was Jabu's link with Eskom? So a body that is not the Eskom board takes a decision to suspend Eskom Executives. Yes @SanFran Arnold Dudu Myeni can not escape prison @rohan barnard She still contest being declared a delinquent director. Bigger things are coming @Val Speirs It cant be Mabuza as he is not a young African Jabu Mabuza joined Eskom post-Zuma government Zuma's Kitchen Cabinet Tsotsi was the first person to testify about this meeting. Jabu was an Eskom insider or an intelligence person. @Phindile Mbonani Jabu Mabuza was not in Eskom when Zuma was president. The attack on Zondo is done by scoundrels who want to derail the commission I agree @Mfundo "Jabu Ivan Maswanganye

SD Gudunkomo,why Mr Zondo smilling? This guy has just said Zuma wasn't present. David Butler are you sure or its just your assumptions Did the president joined before you went to the other room or you went to the other room then the president join? 😊 trying hard to find holes I think chairman will come to a conclusion that Zuma had a meeting with Dudu before the meeting Derek Main. why? Derek what did he do that wasn't done before or that is not happening now? But Derek you sound like you hate him not because of corruption but perhaps for something else Derek that is what I want to find out from you cos u seem to hate the man why you hate him Derek? Mfundo but we haven't found anything on him.the commission hasn't found any evidence. Derek the only thing I don't understand is why we must hate Zuma for the things happened while we must applaud Ramaphosa for the same things happening right now Do you think this witness is helping the commission? "Mfundo I don't hate him but I see a puppet Yeah he had to do start network outside west.although his connections with the Guptas I disapprove but for the fact that he tried to brake the status quo
YAPHA MSOMI,what is going to be achieved by this enquiry. To me its a waste time and money. People are unemployed out there and money is being wasted in such commission of enquiries
Sergio De Matos,"Gerard
Mr Groo,@SabeloNxumalo Judge Zondo is pulling a fake smile which is the same smile the Whites pull towards Blacks @Rohan this is not a secret though @SanFran & Yohan i truly thought this is not that deep. Forgive me @Madolidoli Lol i agree with you there i was jus tryina point out that Judge Zondo's smile was so fake towards the witness
thando nicky,unemployment can only be blammed on technology advances nothing else yahpa there will never be a time in this life time where there is 100% employment rate this life is a mess eddie if you connected you hardly need much
Val Speirs,The Fixer had to protect the President and others. I think Linnel was hired to play down those responsible for Eskoms demise. Linnel probably protected that evil monger Mugabe. The Gupta's were in the other room with Jacob Dudu Myeni obtained Linnels services.. ESKOMS JABU MABUZA I didn't hear that Jabu was young but Jabu Mabuza is the former Chairman of Eskoms board. Ramaphosa insisted that Zuma has an enquiry. It was not Zuma who wanted the enquiry he was ordered to have an enquiry by Ramaphosa. They are trolls
