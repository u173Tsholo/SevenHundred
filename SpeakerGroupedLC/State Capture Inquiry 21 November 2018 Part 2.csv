Kuhle ukuhlangana nabantu abasancela isintu njengawe!! "em D Nah...I doubt bro Peter pott I am still asking myself bro?? How is this possible though Abafana baka Malume Joshua Door = Mcebisi and Fuzile Sam Vanguard but that is wrong though. We want to participate in the economy when we seek land for shelter and sustain a living among other things Was he fired or did he resign??
GH MG,Chose to spoke?? yet he wants to sound so english. Why do lawyer like to caress their buttocks when speaking? he wants to sound english lool Bonani...my observation too...so irritating and how did he lose the tooth? "Items Mfundo...lol maybe there is too much air entering the mouth through the gap Noooo Mfundo who uses thereafter other than in writing? this guy though...lol which coconut Anele? Paaageee 55! "Because of the gap Fuzile laughs and suddenly stops like Kanye West michael who???
Kevin Davis,whatever happens let's not have malema as our next president we will be relying on bank notes
peter pott,"luthuli house just keeps both pravin and CR president @mg we learn that from Europe courts. and may choose to emulate them "look at fuzile "@Lukas "they always used the reason of how much the Rand went to beautiful girls are one reason I watch this at timesüòÄüòÄgoodness why to I have to work in Europe when such beauty is back home "astute judge "@Veerasamy "not saying there is a law against.

Ewald Kruger,It would have gone right over the head of the 33 percentagers. I feel for you @Sthakathi Khumalo. "Lungisa Fuzile "Google ""REFLECTIONS ON A CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE WITH LUNGISA FUZILE"". Interesting stuff..."

dave east,loool gh mg yes my lord looool mfundo yes my lord a line is not a paragraph africans need to create their own industry not work 4 white people loool khalid right guys why do you people watch this stuff informed about what and to do what youtube is supposed to be a communicating technology but as a black people we dont use it wisely im currently in the usa on holiday and meeting and see groups that want to talk and unite with africans abrosd youtube should be used to unite our people globally... keeping us up to date with progress .... setting up charities where we can donate and fund the struggle. our people is an african . we are in an economic and political war and the implications of this is death thando youre a fool and joking is what u do leb m malema just recently said that african women arent supporting the EFF. why ive been paying attention and seeing a lot of indian and white women starting femenist groups in South Africa and the women have been going along @thando how can the women be joining femenist groups when feminism is about fight patriarchy. the patriarchy that runs south africa is white men. why are our women fight for feminism against us when we are poor thando its a serious question How can african women be fighting FEMENISM in south africa against black men when we men arent in control. patriarchs control land jobs and money and white men do this we black men are poor? right @lee are there any african women here woman lungaisani are you a black woman lungisani How can african women b fighting FEMENISM in south africa against black men when we men arent in control. patriarchs control land jobs and money and white men do this we blackmen are poor? how so thando patriarchs control land money and jobs . what do south african black men control for black women to fight us for? guys its a serious question. if we ss men dont control anything why would our women be joining femenist groups to fight for womens groups but not for pan Africanism it makes no sense

Mhlanguli Dlodlo,@peter pott let wait and hear what this bureaucrat has to say. Lets pay attention to his testimony @Sthakathi Khumalo wayixosha kutheni lebhari? "@Sthakathi Khumalo PG threw around the number of 500 billion the money ""stolen"" by the other cabal. Im hoping this guy will pull out the invoices and how they were payed." "@peter pott Chris was there for two years only @peter pott We are listening to sophisticated corruption. What does he mean THERE OUGHT NOT to be a debate about what a nation can afford? This is very arrogant Here's an interesting one from Fuzile. So under Mbeki the main drivers of the jobless growth was largely due to commodity price boom. This is usually spinned incorrectly @lee royal it matters mhlobo wam because remember the 50billion budget shortfall last year was highly politicized. The SARS commissioner who rained in the large companies in gone now @lee royal true. But also a treasury DG who is hard on big business is very important. Not some cat who is a puddle and soft on business who avoid tax. @lee royal I think tax money is one of the transformation tools available for government. There are others of course. @lee royal I agree with my leadership. But today lets focus on this one because its also very important. @Sthakathi Khumalo he resigned
Thiza William,"Evidence uncovered of EFF Juju asked for evidence...It's now available.

I understand and agree with you. What was done in the past was wrong. But what are you going to do with the land after you get it And I understand that you are angry. you have a valid reason. But after you get your appropriated farm. who are you going to direct your anger at then? That is true @Noko in the past and now there is a lot of black people working very hard on farms they don't own.
