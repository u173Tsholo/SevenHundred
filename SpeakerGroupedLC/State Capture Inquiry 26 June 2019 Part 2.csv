Nelson Musoliwa,She got a profound knowledge of her job this lady Simon you are correct this type of professional could have saved SA billions She is falling short of answering the question on what was her overall reaction to this guy outburst why didnt she asked him about the agreement he spoke about
Kevin Simon,This lady is an excellent witness! Need more SAns of this caliber is corporations. Just get Zwane there. Get the cops to wait and march him off for charging processing. There's something very satisfying and being able to block Jacob Zuma. Love it!!! Mduduzi Thabede ​@jacob Watching the parly debate ne? Doubt it. They may read numbers and that'll scramble his brain cell. Zondo has read this witness' statement and wanted to get to the meat of it. That's why he was so impatient this morning. I'm sure adv September is going to do better as well. Gigaba clearly showed up as having been emascuated Maybe suits were too tight then already... "Jacob's opening gambit.. ""Cough..Cough.. Splutter Cough.. I have a cold""" This is embarrassing for all South Africans. The Indians strong-armed us and our representatives were like lapdogs.... This explains some behavior https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/politics/how-pentecostalism-explains-jacob-zumas-defiance-and-lack-of-shame/ar-AADs5ds?ocid=spartanntp "I don't expect Zuma will take the stand
ssgs ssgs,she is proper this one this is the best evidence and narration in a long time
Reinette Raubenheimer,agree @abel brilliant witness dcj Zondo is actually leading the witness Salute DCJ ZONDO for doing 2 jobs today.... chair and advocate....
Mduduzi Thabede,😀😀😀 @jacob Watching the parly debate ne? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m impressed by the witness But it’s unfair to the evidence leader Which is unfair Who’s mabhena I’m seeing minister Nxesi dosing off in parly.. True 🤣🤣🤣🤣 😀😀😀 Eish Gigabyte Special advisor to gigabyte 👍 Absolutely the best Gigabyte mara... True
shawn engelbrecht,hello i dont think so
Jayden Bango,why were we muted before lunch things are heating up the Guptas and Gigaba in bed again @richard borain the issue is not zondo but the adv. who fails to articulate herself and own the show. she is still inexperienced and should never have taken this platform @carnoth ngomane lol the lower courts. the comission has no time to tutor interns @carnoth ngomane my point is she cant come hear to show us her incompetence which the judge clearly sees all the time. this is not a polatform to learn. she is failing the simple things ... "@carnoth ngomane .definitely @carnoth ngomane thats also true. Zuma aint coming guys am sorry to inform u. do not raise your expectations who is mahlangu guys thanks this is captivating and interesting.we are getting to the flesh bye bongani is Mr Daka the chair of SAA? Gigabyte was strangled by Zuma looooool quite some fireworks nyana DPE was captured by GB they have constitutional teeth @Vincent Nthomang Zondo findings and recommendations will be followed in the main "@LYD online tv I disagree "@LYD online tv Agrizzi has appeared b4 a court together with the bosasa former CFO as a direct result of the proceedings that came out of this commission @Monique’s Makeup i am also curious what hapopened with that lady. i hope they wil haul her and hlaudi to this commission "@LYD online tv I will accept DCJ does not look like he drinks or smokes. lool @Viwe Soga we have had no option for the past two days so lets live with it @Sipho Owen Ndhlovu if she ever was @Monique’s Makeup you dont discharge all your deadly artillery at the start. you wait till the end @Charles Nkadimeng ms spet. is being hard on herself i have not seen or heard anything articulate from this adv. Zondo is indirectly attacking the lead evidence leaders.they must pick better advocates @makhosi nobhatyi correct.its not his job to arrange facts "the guptas were already rich and privileged before they came here loool "@Charles Nkadimeng lol...exactly she is stealing the show now "@Diana Sekatane correction we need a break for sure Oh really......Oh...really dont worry Ms September everythong has its time. Zondo didnt wake up a DCJ when is Nomvula coming if at all Ms. Buthelezi is the other one whats the name of this chairperson people "@Thando Nkutha the BIG 3 League is Hofmyer @Dan Brown i mean the SAA chair they keep referring to @Monique’s Makeup she was here izolo @Monique’s Makeup she is not in today but i saw her yesterday morning @Monique’s Makeup correct dudu myeni 🤣 is advocate still around looooool shots fired booooooooooom this lady spilling the beans now the bot is back
richard borain,It appears as if Zondo picks on the advocate frequently What a very bright witness....so articulate and intelligent... Articulates so well Perpetually picks on Mz September.....it should be brought to his attention
Born free,hehe he eeh.. Jacob I can't wait to see you here next month.. don't forget your hankey cos you going to sweating under the heat pastor JJ ..🤣🤣🤣💩💩 I can just imagine how slow Jacobs evidence will be..its going to a long four days.. 🤔😓 Guptas Jet Air company 🙈 15th to the 29th July Zuma to appear 15th to 19th July. Ex President. Zondo will issue a supeona if Zuma does not appear he will be arrested. Not sure Keith but his attorneys have responded and said he will appear at the commission. I am sure Zuma will apply delaying tactics. @Pastor.. haha yes Monica had his DNA @Keith... Bill Clinton in the Oral Office. He was empeached but served his 8 year term. Guptas owned Jet Airways Corruption is about self enrichment and NOT helping other peoples lives. I cannot imagine that Zondo has a corrupt bone in his body. Cyril Ramophosas reply to the SONA was exactly the same as his SONA.. just pipe dreams. I think fear of losing their jobs. @Peter.. he did not address Farm murders as per Groenewalds mention at the SONA. Very disappointed in Cyril He is just a dreamer. True Peter there was so much he failed to address. Wish tMiss September and Zondo are at loggerheads Procurement and Risk Management State sectors have been hijacked for years to date. Cannot have Miss September leading evidence to Zuma. The Guptas were not friends they were the enemy of SAs economy We have to thank Agrizzi. I wonder where we would be in this country if not for Agrizzi. @ Diane.. because Zuma is dumber than Dumbest. The Guptas only became wealthy through Zuma and his Presidency. @Diane.. that's why the ANC fought for 107 years 🤣🤣 Judge Zondo giving Miss September a hard time.. he wants to cut to the chase. No understanding @ Lee Hendrix Miss Nutgel Miss Buthelezi is not experienced enough to lead Zuma either. Yes she is well educated which makes all the difference. 🤣🤣🤣true@Dan Brown one x 6 plus 2 x 00 and 0ne 9 plus 6 and ninety eight and seven zero billion Rand.. said Zuma. 🤣🤣 ok I smell sewerage Number 1..has come up often Is it a Fembot?? Comrade Zuma wanted to help his comrade friends.. the Guptas.. he saw nothing wrong in that. She could be saving herself.. she is smart
Legae Nyalungu,ADV September is now Mabena😭 DCJ doing the job himself I said it..ADV September is Mabena of the evidence leaders if you follow this commission..ADV September is always in trouble due to her lack of preparation and poor at leading witnesses.
carnoth ngomane,@Jayden Bango how else will she gain experience if she shy away from such platforms? "@Jayden Bango i suppose shes been to the lower courts otherwise she wouldnt be here "@Jayden Bango i agree with you @Jayden Bango perhaps budget constrains has compelled them to use rookies "@Jayden Bango i dont him coming "@Thando Nkutha Zuma and his lawyers clearly knows thats not allowed Corruption is cancerous to our country "@Cerebis being in parliament as a chair doesnt mean they are off the hook @LYD online tv with Zuma's claws on NPA telling the truth then would have been fruitless "@LYD online tv that could be another reason why some chose to exercise their right to remain silent  @Monique’s Makeup the brain under her hair thats what matters @Monique’s Makeup i get you
Sam Monkoe,Mabena Lol Lol
0Sweetgal0,Jet Airways has since been liquidated hooray!
clive oconnell,@Born free If they ask Zuma to read numbers of millions stolen. 4 days too short Zuma's rent a mob just getting municipal busses and ancwl shirts ready "@Dan Brown He can read his bank statements in Dubai Number 1 is number 💩💩
Diana Sekatane,our people are captured because of the love of money. the Guptas were putting their fingers in every pie. Trying to to collect so much money within a short period of time. Zuma does not know why are people on his case because he did not do anything wrong. the Guptas were not that super rich but now they are. Zuma was in intelligence section of ANC he knows exactly what he is doing. our country and the economy is in shambles.
Bruce Andrew,Cricket much better- New Zealand in big trouble our hacker is back
KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Bruce Andrew JUST thought Bruce. I was busy and decided to watch this. But nah This hacker is trying to entice us with something Why these people kept quiet for too long? What if this commission of inquiry was never recommended by Thuli? "Anyway I would rather lose a job than letting corruption to going on unexposed. @Born free Zuma is subpoenaed already isn't? @THABE PHALANE YES His name has been all over the show...he must now say his side "Yes "@Born free Yeah @Thando Nkutha Thats all i know... subpoenaed to testify. Simple. A lawyer may act on his behalf or present him...if he does not comply. Lets not try to complicate its simple @Kevin Allister Simon He has no choice but to testify if subpoenaed This reminds of Clinton in 1998 lol @Kevin Allister Simon I was a curious 14 year old back then... when Clinton was in a mess @Pastor JJ Gosh... people here are so eager to show they know better than the other LOL. Crazy "@Pastor JJ I am not talking being comparative or talking from a comparative premise. Read my context. I meant mess in terms of ""subpoena to the Grand Jury. Ask first." I am not here to prove am right than the other here... Jeez. I have gone past such levels...gosh LOL """if the president is asked to testify Inspirational but why they all kept quiet by then? @Bongani Mpapele lol Fear you right @Hester Ferrezuelo Ramaphosa admitted @Bongani Mpapele He ate himself """imagine in your mouth """ "@Hester Ferrezuelo Yes "Was happy and was so attentive to hear what he was going to say...@Hester Ferrezuelo ""I was scared that i may or will be fired. But i knew time will come."""
THABE PHALANE,when is our president coming does to appear means to testify subpoenaed? ???
Lorna Kavanagh,Zuma and all his cronies and pals must stand trial for treason...... they have ruined this country just like Mugabe ruined Zim. Adv Maleka to take Zuma on.
Bongani Mpapele,Enjoy the rest of the day people...I love you and let's move SA forward "I'm back Whatever She is saying is factual. I would love to believe that Gigaba was gigabyting her.@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU "Maybe this is the lady who was meant to receive that video "These guys were chawing our money Remember what the former ANCYL did to the Limpopo Province government? What we are going through now is history and there is a possibility of it repeating itself if we vote them in. Yes @Thulani Bukani "@Thulani Bukani they would be very corrupt Yes it is Live not recorded @Born free @Lex Luger "This lady is telling nothing but the truth @Christopher Maanda vhathu vho diphina rinne ro thalela "@LYD online tv She was in a difficult space back then "@Christopher Maanda zwino rikho themba Vho Cyril Ramaphosa "@LYD online tv I hope so too @Christopher Maanda jah ridofha tshifhinga vha lugisa shango lashu.
Thulani Bukani,✊🏿👊🏿 Maybe Zuma taught Gigaba the Gigabyte Grip 🤣😂 @Bongani why do we keep voting them back into power I'm with you Monique so our only hope is that the ANC fixes itself? if we got all the SRCs around the country's universities to start a political party. do you believe those youngsters would be more corrupt than the ANC if they won an election? he doesnt like her. yho she doesn't help herself either he doesnt even allow her to balls it up before he intervenes. he looks for things wrong in her question before she finishes asking it. @Monique she's the white lady that takes no nonsense. You cant try your tricks with Hofmeyer I cant trace if she's english or afrikaans Yes @Monique 🤣😂 Zinto a zondo always cracking jokes when she's in town
Vincent Nthomang,i am watching from botswana and i am really enjoying this... This woman is an inspiration...so confident "@Hester Ferrezuelo she is better off in the corporate world driving the economy @Hester Ferrezuelo it so sad tht some folks can subbotge their own country just to pocket a few millions...insane.I hate corruption MONEY CHOWING will never end but we should never give up the fight DO THESE COMMISSION OF INQUIRIES HAVE TEETH????? @Jayden Bango thanx...i wish we could have one here in bots...i wish I AM GONNA STOP TYPING BECAUSE I DONT HAVE DIVIDED ATTENTION @LYD online tv LOL @LYD online tv and we are here waisiting our emotions @LYD online tv 😎🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 YOURE FUNNY @LYD online tv exctly what you suggested @Thando Nkutha thats funny yep lol @Born free true we would be doomed
Hester Ferrezuelo,@Vincent Nthomang CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE HAVE HER CALIBER IN PARLIAMENT? @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I guess fear ... @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU really? I missed that @Vincent Nthomang Yes you right "@Vincent Nthomang …. I can't help to think that Zuma's ""clever blacks statement"" was aimed at the likes of her to deter them from speaking out." @Vincent Nthomang and at whose expense? The government's own vulnerable people.... very sad indeed @makhosi nobhatyi I agree! There is hope.
Mayembe 50,also watching from Gaborone enjoying this too. True 🤣🤣🤣 🙉🙉🙉
Kumbirai Gwata,Who owned jet airways?
Brian Muleya,"Wooow "To who was she supposed to say the truth to...when things like these happen Seems like the Guptas were in every business... Miss September really needs the break... Maleka and his accent... Zuma and his lawyers will cause problems for the commission... @Monique’s Makeup...😆what if they give Zuma to Miss September...
carol berry,@brian muleya I agree!
Mulunghisi Mulunghisi,Keith ramaphosa admitted what "if politics need education its will better
Norman Zwane,"@Thando Nkutha ""dilika jele"" would be useless if Ace's people built the prisons coz the houses they build crumble in the rain. Most prisoners would want ""dilika Jele"" hoping for heavy rains soon."
Thandeka Phakathi,m from the Sona....what is happening today here
Monique Jones,@Thulani Bukani Because you are afraid of what an EFF or DA-led government would bring to the majority. Chaos! @Thulani Bukani not saying you personally If I held a high position I would get my hands dirty through hard work and not corruption. I would love to head public works. Get the communities involved building Isn't the Hawks investigating Faith Mutambi for corruption She has been the worst evidence leader of all. Get that cheshire cat smiling dude that ticked off Jimmy Manyi I like him @Lex Luger. You don't know where he's coming or going Her hair is cute tho @richard borain why do you think he does? She's been ineffective @carnoth ngomane I didn't say it didn't matter I just noticed her hair is cute @polla you think Zuma wants to get into the cat bird seat? @Brian Muleya that's how they finance all their family's elaborate weddings--on the backs of SAns @Legae Nyalungu Right! So what time is it there? Is he SAs version of Prince Harry? No @Jayden Bango this is great and sad entertainment all at the same time Right @Jayden Bango she has to learn and grow. She'll get there one day Which one is Hofmeyer? @Jayden Bango izolo? I must've missed her She's always laughing with Zondo? Thanks @Jayden Bango and @Thulani Bukani @Brian Muleya naw I think Zondo can handle them along with Maleka 😸 I'm glad I'm on summer vacation the week Zuma shows up @Brian Muleya now you know that's like Trump visiting Africa. It ain't happening! Would he get up there and speak in isiZulu as his cuzzin Bathabile does when under pressure? @MIKE LOCK the enemy is anyone participating in corruption. ANYONE!!! I need more coffee. Not even 10 am and I need a nap! @D Cole I spit out my coffee laughing at your joke. Juju as prez! C'mon you made my day! No @MIKE LOCK He and Shivambu will get everything for free Well bye y'all! Greetings all the way from Texas.
Sthakathi Khumalo,"Even today Nkululeko Zondo LOOLS... Your brother has patience tjooo She just wants to implicate Gigaba eagerly hehe "Zondo is correct Now this is where we should open our eyes!! Where are Black businesses benefiting because they dont!! The real reason she was sidelined... She sold out and teamed with white people What were your views on integrating black business?? "Its obvious There is nothing wow about `I mean`— [like really now..] "Lets just be honest now people Why do we black people like fighting one another though? Instead the enemy benefits from these things nje
makhosi nobhatyi,"I just finished very high quality response from our president @Cerebis that is not just a promises that is constructive programming for the next 5 "We want all those who are implicated not use media platforms to address or attack credibility of the commission that shows denial from truth @carnoth ngomane I agree with you 100% it may be a plan done by Ace Magashule if it is to ousted President but they are not going to relax anymore as they will come in and out of court to ans corrupts Miss September is not asking online with previous witnesses she is contradicting herself @Lex Luger 😃😃😃 Manyi was crying asking a protection from being asked questions which might contradict him coz he come alone without lawyer 😃😃 Zondo wants concrete and quality question to be asked which will be in line with testimony @Lex Luger nowonder how Zuma will respond on the matter? I doubt he will break down on cross questioning time "@Lex Luger yes it is Nothing was right done by Guptas Lex Luger 🙆🏻‍♀️😃😃😃 @Dian sekatane yes was there but nothing he achieved there accept transform those individuals to be mafias
DJ DJ,Yes @Thulani Bukani

LYD online tv,This is just a reality TV show. @Vincent Nthomang just for entertainment as well... lol @Vincent Nthomang nothing ever comes out of these inquiries... @Vincent Nthomang Yes! Just like watching the Kardashians... lol @Jayden Bango hahahahahhahaha...!!! We will see but Jiba was not fired until administration changed. 3 years later... "QUESTION: What makes these people that knew there were irregularities not come out then - intimidation "@Jayden Bango Fair enough. I just feel that the uncovered rot is deep through the many inquiries in proportion to few sample of consequences = little. Commissions: Esidimeni @Bongani Mpapele I wish she would've told the truth then but it's still fine now... @carnoth ngomane Yah ne @Bongani Mpapele indeed. Agrizzi...😁 @Tikvah Olam you predicted right re; gigaba I still SALUTE the Guptas... So much capture! @Christopher Maanda a lot of money @Brian Muleya Every SOE... Even Land reform @Monique’s Makeup They really did it big. lol QUESTION: How come every witness besides Agrizzi is NOT admitting also having their hands in the cookie jar? @Lex Luger You mean this? Epiphany = moment of sudden great revelation & realization?
Siyamcela Nxathi,True SEXY
Bernard Matolino,@Bongani Mpapele Uthini manje? recent future? this adv is a little bit incompetent @Monique’s Makeup thats the best adv in the land Vincent Maleka SC @Monique’s Makeup and i enjoyed it a great deal when he put Manyi the fish in his place. It was so thorough😀😀😀😀 @LYD online tv Because Agrizzi had an epiphany @makhosi nobhatyi Zuma is a denialist @makhosi nobhatyi Absolutely correct. But you know the poor know nothing. They are the MABHENAs of politicians RIGHTS GUYS enjoy all these details. I have to watch our BRADAS in their 2nd AFCON match. @Thando Nkutha @Pastor JJ They are playing Guinea. I like it when West Africans play each other. They are huge and cancel each other nicely. They rob Bafana with their thunder legs
