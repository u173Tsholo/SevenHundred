Immanuel,ms dlamini related to dr nkosazana dlamini asking you @Anne M😃 in light of her testimony let the eskom employees be vetted to increase renue "this witness is not that smart hey "chair already has an opinion on her "ahhh this lady dlamini is missing the point here "what's wrong with this witness "seems to be have been brain washed not answering the question @Padtor J u can have ms myeni or memela🤣🤣🤣 so vetting was used to to get rid of people. ms myeni was she ever vetted? @Pastor J🤣🤣🤣🤣 "this os called document security in terms of part 24 of the MISS. the learned judge is correct chapter 4 of MISS is clear on document security. how come she doesnt know this? if you business or employment is failing get your employees vetted and boom you will be make some serious revenue🤣🤣 but syrprisingly the same SAA has been under financial bail out year-in year-out. what is this witness talking about mara? "@sipho: "" get thee behind me satan""" "that sipho nonsense blocked "is ms dlamini related to hlaudi by any means
Anne M.,Are you asking or stating a fact? I don't know. Dlamini is quite a common surname in KZN. She's trying to protect Dudu's decision to do the vetting that used iffy questions @Mbizo Slash Dudu definitely needed to know where the threats were. @Jacqui Baumgardt Between a rock and a hard place. She doesn't want to cross Dudu Myeni. Grossly unfair @Jabu Malinga She probably doesn't want death threats. @Ishaad Mohammed Somebody is giving her signs @fuzile dazana I think all the small fish will lead to the big fish "@Carryn Meredith Dudu Myeni used the ""vetting process"" for her own agenda Spot on @Dominic Przybylski yes Because Dudu instructed her to @makhosi nobhatyi "She has a ring on her left hand "Yes @Sipho The Xing I see you're out from school. No homework today? He's a troll @Alan White Used by Dudu Myeni Dudu Myeni I thought you said you were going back to work @Sipho The Xing Your trolling is very immature "No So you lied @Sipho The Xing Where is @Michael Wild? Yes he is @Sipho The Xing Oh just p!$$ off and leave the chat to the grown ups
Norman Zwane,Revenue improvement by SAA ??? Just from vetting alone?
Michael Kaudi,hahahah please please
energy for life,please please Kate my Kate
Mbizo Slash,She just made that up. She can't back it up 😂😂😂 funny thing is that some SAA executives and possibly Gov officials believe her The Gupta's initiated this so they can figure out who will be a treat On that passing her masters dilema we have. I've seen people with no knowledge at all getting their degrees off other student's hard work. Students are encouraged to work in groups she is playing dumb "@ Mashikinya Com on guys this is not a matter of having a degree or not. She is worried that she could implicate herself. Any person would buckle under pressure if they are hiding something 😂😂😂 "If she started from the ground up at work "@ Sipho Sipho is a clout chaser @ Carryn 100% "dude "Power to Elvis
Pheladi Lamola,The judge has had it with this lady😂😂😂🤣 Listening to this lady really hurts. I don't know why I'm still here
Jack M,😀😂
Ndidendavela Nam Bathembu Mgudlwa,Just jail this woman This lady reminds me of SARS protect me from yourself executive
Jacqui Baumgardt,He's totally fed up but she's being blamed for things that she is not responsible for I would have been in tears by now if I were here @ - agree Dudu needs to be in orange overalls @funicanz - . I don't think she's lying she's over a barrel @ - agree Myeni is under two buses now @Dominic - not before the Commission completes its work. I can see a great exodus to states that cannot send these people back "Dudu Dudu is hiding under a rock - no court appearances on the turn - come on DCJ @Jabu Malinga - she was acting on orders the problem is like the advocate the other day - explaining only makes it worse to approve the wrongdoers to approve the wrong doers Puhleese SABC sort this out!
Mohamed Issack,kkk please give her chance to think more about i think she did not prepared well but she defense her self.she has to have more reports now she is in Port
Gert du Plessis,This aunti’s comments will not help Zondo. Her idea of higher turnover at SAA is shocking. Zondo is gatvol now I think this is one of the worst witnesses so far
Chris Welensky,Forget about building a nation SAVE our nation from fools like this The Boobie brothers sings a great song called WHAT A FOOL BELIEVES. Dedicated to her
Pastor J.J,I am now convinced that this is a 20% Graduate. No doubt whatsoever Thank you all for the wonderful and sweet sentiments extended to my Fiancee Kate. I will share your thoughts with her this evening. I did not receive the refund yet@Person of interest I gave Memela to Elvis @Immanuel @Sipho The Xing ...Have you completed the Homework/Project that the Psychiatrist gave you? Do they clean sewers this late in the afternoon @Sipho The Xing There is no prisons in Phoenix only sewers for the likes of you.@Sipho The Xing "Did your mother ever tell you "" I hate the day you was born"". She was right @Sipho The Xing" Lets let Sipho return to his task cleaning the sewers. Bye Sipho I tell you Paul.@Paul Buchel "@Sipho The Xing ...Despite your hatred for all religions Thanks to @Sipho The Xing the devil has joined us.hahahahahaha Going to eNCA
Gabisile Mabuza,I am sorry to say but Ms Dlamini is wasting the Commission's time there were no risks period. tell us the great success ms Dlamini please tell her Adv Hofmeyr ms Dlamini has never been challenged on what she thinks or believes no matter how wrong
ludwemtati,they vetted the pilots and turnover went up😂😂😂😂. Moerskont
George_Lunatic,well now we know why we have such useless people in SOEs if she is the one vetting happily taking a salary for 16 years at the SSA incompetent with a master's degree. so the university must be useless as well
Jabu Malinga,these ones that worry about there nails more than there jobs are really scary..just lik PP Mkwebane "How do they do there everyday ""work"" with nails lik that? do they really go to their offices to work?" Why is this lady lying for Mashobo? that former minister How com the Zulu guy yesterday never stammered or stuttered around..he was crisp and clear? whos lying is sooo clear "Jacqui "Jacqui "But I guess u need the small fish to bring down the big fish "Jacqui "Sthakathi "Jacqui Vetting does not stop corruption.. arrests stop corruption "y is this lady covering for her former bosses? som ppl lives r also in danger "Just ignor trolls guys. they feed of your responses
Shirley Middleton,there is simply NO way this tart has an MBA! Kate for President!! And Zondo as her deputy
Peet Venter,sje's skipping pages using those kong nails..
Adri Nolan,Total incompetence and misguided Ok so the whole exersise was a waist of time and money agree Totally pointless exercise Surely if they do the vetting they should be fully informed as to what the law regarding vetting does and dies not say. She has decided on a varsion of her story and there is no way she is open to any logic presented to her One expexts only the top staff in any company would have access to privilaged information. That is a very basic consept is it not ? There are presceibed ways of handeling classified documents in your posession. Surely she was not asked to speculate of current staff following policy ?
Dominic Przybylski,Findings were that Dudu got hold of intensely private information on her managers. According to SteenHuizen - there will be no arrests before next year. How can somebody in state security be so naive? Big fish are in Cuba and Dubai - only sardines left here. "Whenever i was pulled in to lead a project the first question I asked was ""Why are you doing this?"" The first answer is almost always a lie. Project cannot succeed if leader doesn't know truth." @Carryn Meredith Vetting in this case seems to have been to get private info on subordinates to used for intimidation. Was used to figure out who can be INCLUDED in corrupt activities. People wonder why not all university graduates are employable? I think the testimony of this lady and the advocate head of procurement at SAAT enlightens me. @MIKE DURBAN The ANC think they are the state. @Sipho The Xing You have lived a deprived life. @Sipho The Xing It seems that your degree does not excuse your attitude. If you revise your attitude you may find that your degree supports you. Of the three most intelligent people I know two are women. Sharon Stone (from Basic Instinct) has IQ of 150+ @Person of interest exactly. @Pastor J Nothing wrong with people cleaning sewers. SA incompetency @Craig Johnson. The technical quality of ENCA's coverage of Dudu Myeni's trail is far worse.
Person of interest,how do people text with the nails? "Unprepared but not defensive Cadre deployment Ms Hofmeyr ❤️💕 I'm here for the Kate vetting of the big fish behind the little fish "Pastor J it's on its way Pastor It must be hard to do a decent job when the hyenas are circling "Yay Don't give the troll oxygen "Yes Jabu "Carryn "Me too "Oops "Sipho ENCA here we come
funicanz,This lady did her job according to a mandate and information she was given. She analysed her findings according to verbal conversations. "@Jacqui Baumgardt  "@Jacqui Baumgardt  She is yet to explain what was successful about her vetting project that she was asked to vet pilots.
MIKE DURBAN,All the Elite studied at the same Uni..........and great brainwashing success........ Geeez........remember one thing....all the birds of a feather flock and studied together....true ne........ Eeeesh...there some big fish in Zumatjie Fire Pool....... Telll her DCJ.....nail this Gucci one... EEEsh....she's now being cheeky........geeez True... I love Miss Hoff....... Geeeeez....this one is really doff....or acting it.. The ANC think they are the Law.........true ne Wow.......she's really acting strange etc.......and the quick right glances etc.........strange.....ne @Alan White ....geeez.......sure is This one sure has an Entitlement mindset........i reckon.. If you challenge this one....those orange nails will attack you'''heheh Like Edward Scissors hands..... Mmmmm.......ANC security hitting back now....... Called .....fidelling with the evidence.......
TheMzolo,@Dominic Przybylski..It is called Dunning-Kruger Effect..
Easy D,I hope the vetting included stool sampling also.. Exactly... You would ask them nicely to leave... Judge is clearly exausted...
Ishaad Mohammed,why does she look to her right every now and then. is it because he lawyer is giving her signs @Anne M I am certain of that how much did this vetting process cost @Sipho The Xing i think you related to the witness
fuzile dazana,"sad thing about this stAte capture it focus on small fish  i dont think we will find big fish is in cuba she must take out the nails mybe she will know the success she must speak the truth or this day will be like 10yeas yhoo she was deployed bt dudu to do her dirty job she was used now she s under the bus indeed carryn sabotage its that document that dj went to sign document of sabotage
Felicia Malefo,she flips the hair😀 she is annoyed now shame there is no way you forget to put all your paper /memo work she lies
8nine Group,fake her thats why she cant think
rosalind gerber,this is the result of appointment on basis of race I believe there is a whole shoal of big fish would someone rip those nails off her paws please it didn't Hof university is overrated. about time people woke up to this. @honest sipho yip @martha they are cut from the same cloth yes sabc sound!!! enca is working
Madoda Nkalane,What kind if great success is this??
Olona Mpuma,mmm even the worst fool can see that she's lying
Paul Buchel,Corrupt government human resources departments and the UNIONS are the reason why this country is stuffed. "@Jabu Malinga "@Alan White​ It's entertaining when I've blocked some idiots and can't see what cr@p they are talking about. But the remarks are funny@Pastor J.
Dr_X2Trix,Is this chop still talking Bull Im sorry but Vetting will stop stop the looting Sorry will NOT STOP THE LOOTING I used to do vetting its a simple backround check on credit and crim Ill bet that we TAX payers were charged a crazy amount to do vetting when it really costs R75pp I like Kate @fuzile dazana if she was placed to do dirty work and what is coming out of her mouth she deserves every bit she gets How can you say that you can not dismiss someone for Crim backround UTTER BULL S*&%^ This chick has a Masters degree If this is what we hear about things beyond the year 2000 what do we not know?????????/ @Mbizo Slash she does not know what she is talking about @Ben Cole Puplic platform allow the people to speak or hide the chat she is stupid........ @Sipho The Xing I have yet to a female CIT robber Clearly still a closet case as you wanted to marry her she is i know @Sipho The Xing you can not compare her to all woman #ZONDOFORPRESIDENT Anyone agree???? I have waTCHED HIM ALOT AND REALLY LIKE HIM One can see he has brains AHH no more comedy
makhosi nobhatyi,But there was corruption nje You accelerate corruption there Why do you did vetting if there would be no measures miss Dlamini
clive oconnell,Pilots association would never allow this intuition Do as your corrupt ANC masters tell you break our laws Masters degree in nail polish EFF JULIUS HAD BLUE LIGHT PROTECTION
Message SHONGWE,"Eish 
Colleen Arezio,After our DCJ told that lawyer to sit down it looks like he has adopted a much stronger approach with witnesses. SA have this woman fired from her job because she is ...... you fill out the blanks.
Siwaphiwe Louis Mbara,she is annoying I'm sorry DCJ is gatvol Hofmeyr is right. Dlamini can't say vetting was reducing risks when they actually DON'T fire those who don't get a PASS
Raven Penny,this witness don't no that she did wrong
Moshoeu Mabusela,What nonsense is this woman saying. Shoooooooo "If she is not a lawyer Now they are wasting time teaching her the law. Is not her competency hle!
Abel Matshidiso,@Pastor J ur welcome sir 😀😀😀😀
Lebogang Gaorutwe,yesssssseeeeessss this woman is weak - how was she vetted herself? This is looting at the highest order - worse by a young woman who can still prosper in life @Carryn Meredith - 100%
Sherwin Peters,is it me or does the witness sound like she's related to Bathabile Dlamini? 👍 @Anne but they speak similar
