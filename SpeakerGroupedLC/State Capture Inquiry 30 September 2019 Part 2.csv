Rudi Haywood,African time 👍🏽 "@Heather Cotton quite so. Munusamy on discuss leave after implication Colonels doing flight bookings and car maintenance 🤦🏽‍♂️ It would take 5 years to get through no?

Oscar Theo,thank you chair
Yolo More,Chair is there any law that prevents you from taking over this evidence leading thing? We are running out of time and the evidence leaders seem as if they don't understand. People have to go to jail. The findings of the DCJ will be more heavier than those of the other chairs who presided over other commissions. I hope and pray that he uses an iron fist when he makes the findings. Makoya Aggrizzi "Watson Watson he was being modest😂😂 "Watson "Hofmeyer They are busy with the big fish. The likes of Dudu Myeni and Koko Matamela. "Tikvah 😂😂😂😂😂his fancy hats 8 people flying to Singapore to buy 1 equipment which should had been ordered online. Tikvah Olam he was kept in the position to protect the evidence. You use a thief to catch other thieves. "After this strenuous commission Stop now. You need to go and rest. DCJ is not well at all but he doesn't wanna go and rest. "Kay Kay no So much info. No Hendrix😆😆 "Lex Kruger 64? Huh! And high rate of unemployment 64 members at a go! The side chic is a queen! Bloody cheat Sthakathi but why is she called a queen while the wife is vrou🤗🤗 "Sihle Now Mr faceless is singing. Yhooooo! This is a mess. Cadre deployment is destroying this country. A drug dealer appointed at CI! Is this Lazarus white or black? "I know "OK Shame marn. He is a workaholic
