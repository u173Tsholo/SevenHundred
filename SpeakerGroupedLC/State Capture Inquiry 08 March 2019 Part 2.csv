Amit Kumar,hi sir how are you
Musa Bakiti,andiyazi Adv Baleka ask him in afrikaans so that he can recall. Ask him his name if he can recall.just checking Adv Maleka @Dr Thabang Kutumela I recall Adv Maleka is a member of EFF government of the the whole Africa "Salute Adv Maleka makes me proud to be a black man The reason is he pocketed cash . I am EFF menber but still i want afrikaans to remain in farming business.No afrikaaner in any office apart the police office. "This one here is not white  Rugby and farming that's where we can use him. @Myka'Al Daud 😂😂😂😂 @Eugene Fourie Don't worry about whites cause you are afrikaaner and you have nothing to do about whites.The fight in South Africa is between whites and blacks = Afrikaaners @John-Basel Ioannou I have no land to give to my children like i don't belong . @John-Basel Ioannou i am not rich but i can afford to employ 3 afrikaaners and still cannot afford to buy a farm Adv Maleka exposed this guy and what a shame. South Africa is loosing alot of money by keep afrikaans South Africa need to import white people from Great Britain and export Afrikaans to Newzealand. @Thandazile Nkwali As long you share this land with afrikaaners racism will never end .Eugene is a AWB member watch out. @Myka'Al Daud Eugene Think that the dying of Eugene Terreblanch was the dying of racism.Dom kop😂😂😂

All he do was chuckle - The d 👀 s Did 😏 Whatevvva 🤗 ☯️ True Story. R looks like a Hippo 🦛 and now the Zoooma chuckle to “Round It Off”. Proudly White - Embarrassed Of SA! To continue their looting!!!

MIKE DURBAN,@Musa.........hope u mean All Our Land... @Moira......just a proudly South African...that is Also Entitled.........heheh. @Musa......you are right...one should be proud of one's heritage etc etc....I sure am as well...great struff Bra.. And this only because the ANC has screwed up Big Time....... No other reason at all....... @Musa.....The DA...is the way to go Bra......they are the Lesser of All the Evils.........my opinion... @Michael Michael ......the ANC/EFF are a bunch of Commies/Socialists........true...we don't want them here.... Folks.......i'll only start believing...when i see the guilty doing jail time..... Never forget this folks....Rama and Co are all cot fro the same ANC cloth..........think about it... @ nikki.........all dummed down ANC brainwashed sheeple......true story @Myka'Al Daud .......reckon they are the Lesser of All the Evils.............check them out...
Eugene,👋☯️ SA is 🤮 appalling Robert can't take his own medicine Africa is still not civilised who did? Myka now your just making things up your Marxist master did not tell you to say that what is white supremacy? You still didn't tell me what white supremacy is. Don't use words if you can't describe what it is. Who should whites vote for? between ANC and EFF? Forget about other parties for now. ANC will take land without compensation but they will not expropriate. The eff will expropriate if they don't make it state owned. either way the land will be state owned by the ANC and just rot I'm sorry that I hurt your feeling when I said you have a low IQ I was just pointing out facts. peace? no your bring up white supremacy again but you can't even explain what it is. Why do you use words if you don't know what it means? You make no since Musa..... The ANC is not afrikaans It's the British that's the racist that cause all chaos not the Afrikaner Racism was dead just a few years ago but then the EFF brought it back

Thabang M,Did Adv Maleka Represent Julius Malema On A Hate Speech Case At Some Point When He Was A Youth League President??? Musa Bakiti Thanks for enlighten me Adv Maleka's English Is On Another Level 🤞🙄 He was not valued at all @Sonia I Believe They Will Lose Some Provinces even if they win national "@Michael Yeah This are the highly contested elections in history but the battle is between EFF Coalitions are likely to happen It's public knowledge that local government elections are reflecting how our political system becoming more unpredictable and it's now harder to get dominant by over 50% Transnet and provincial government departments we still have a long way to go to defeat racism 😏
Myka'Al Daud,What was AWB doing @ eskom Yin your statement makes no sense This guy was sleeping at work afriforum is ready to represent him in court He was paid for doing nothing Remember national party was corrupt n bankrupt this country b4 dawn of democracy "Afrikans vote wisely Is this the sun set clause in play here This Dutchman looks tired n hopeless Honest HAHAHAHA!!!!! national party was honest to u "Boot when your ancestors were staying in caves in Europe Dutchman is offending? u came n destroyed Afrikan cilization "1st university was in Afrika Afrikans were mining and trading with the east b4 colonization White supremacy must fall "Marxist is foreign  Teach children decolonized quality history Eugene your exposing your ignorance "u can't tell me how to spell my land Eugene u r free to vote 4 anc Nikki is DA a clean party according to u "Mike unfortunately is lesser of all evil to u Lets wait until May n u ll be shocked LOL Eugene u still exposing your low IQ "Is not a fact "Research baba n stop exposing your ignorance in everything or use Google Fools r quick to label others as fools "I know 1 communist n he was assassinated Chris Hani "Khoi n San r our ancestors "LOL Eugene racism was dead Moira u agree with boetie that racism was dead all this past years "Enjoy your weekend 😂😂😂 Bloody fool

Musa you funny ha ha better known as a Dom Kop
Sofia Sofia,Does anyone wonders when JUSTICE will be SERVED from this state stature ? Will you be alive? Retired? or DEAD or will your grandkids benefit or will it just continue ? Do you think all those involved in corruption will be served in this lifetime ? forgiver me if I sound like I have no faith BUT if no one did anything soooo many years ago .... sooo many years later we the PEOPLE are suffering the aftermat This is an uphill for years to come ... Evn if DA come in to power hw quick will they fix things .. EFF for that matter or any other political party .. cause if they could ..POWER or NO POWER they should hve been helping the people anyway What happened if ANC wins elections again ... because realistically people they do have a majority say what we want the possibility is high
Derek Main,eff off Not much of a choice Done
Mzobanzi Dazela,"I guess justice can only be served after elections as a scapegoat to cleanup the ANC. Otherwise "If ANC wins elections "Dr Thabang Thank you Michael.

makhosi nobhatyi,"Atul Gupta is citizenships of this country "Send arrests of koko and executive director
nikki Cruden,"when the public realise that ANC EFF BLF and DA are all funded by the same Zionist KALERGI PLAN "even if one does own land expropriate the land and government will loose massive revenue through current rate payments. "parliament is saturated with psychopaths ( no empathy no remorse no shame no limit to achieve own ends I agree Moira T. Dissolve rotten to the core ANC EFF BLF SABC has spent 24 years feeding the public with low morals and political propaganda. Media could have uplifted and educated our people. Freedom does not mean everything is for free. it should imply that all are free to work to improve self standards. follow the MONEY and the dots join. Nathan Kirsh is a major funder to both sides of the fence and calls the shots. correct me if I'm wrong. or the fishing industry and other natural resources. get educated and feel NB. myka sounds like you are protecting someone from being exposed? guilty by association hey! musa? ? communist leaders now running S.A. are still the same terrorist from the 80s Now sporting fat cat off shore bank accounts at the expense of their own people. ( psychopaths) musa then blacks must go back to the equator where they came from so that the original indigenous people ie Khoi and San can live in harmony. dream on myka "we should be embracing our Different races
