Zimbabwe at the moment has vast economic opportunities for ZAR. Some of them don't see that. I wanna meet Gavin personally one on one
Mchangani Chikusi,His recount of events shows he knows what was happening inside BOSASA. So damning revelations. This is deep rooted corruption. What do you expect her in face of these allegations? Poor Nomnvula... She is afraid she will loose out her position. "Ms Nomvula Mokonyane is currently serving as the Minister of Communications Ms Mokonyane was the Premier of the Gauteng Province from 6 May 2009 until 20 May 2014 Ms Mokonyane was a founder member of the Congress of South African Students (COSAS). She has been part of the ANC cadres who became public representatives in 1994. Ms Mokonyane championed the process that led to Sterkfontein being awarded the status of a World Heritage Site 1996 until 1999 and she established three Metro Police structures during her tenure. "That being said "Yes Mzalwane Mzala But she had influence through her linkages with the ANC not necessarily a Premier. "The Presidency of Thabo Mbeki began on 14 June 1999

Lol A lie has been spread claiming that Cyril is Bidvest chairman Businessman Kevin Wakeford There is nothing wrong with people starting and selling a company. It is not your responsibility when the person you have sold the company to become corrupt. Colien van Rensburg Nomvula Mokonyana must come to present her side of the story. Do you know the name of this daughter who had rich uncles in Bosasa? But she was never a minister in Mbeki's time He said she had influence in Mbeki and Zuma's time. @Sthakathi Khumalo What was said about mbeki? Nomvula was never in Mbeki's cabinet @Sthakathi Khumalo You just want to bring Mbeki in. Their discussing Nomvula's influence and they say it stems from Mbeki's time. No allegation has been made against Mbeki @Derek Main I have no time for you Mbeki stepped down in 2008. @Derek Main On what? @Derek Main Whatever Was she a premier when Mbeki was a president? @Mchangani Chikusi If she became premier in 2009 then Mbeki was not in government
