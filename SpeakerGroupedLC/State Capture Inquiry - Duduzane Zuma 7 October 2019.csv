Anne M.,@Tommy Mty I think Thabete is going to do another affidavit and come back some time in the future. 👍 @Pastor J 😀 You may need more than one can 😀😀😀 Not yet @SABC Digital News The sound is out of sync. Please sort it out. @Pheladi Lamola Kevin Wakeford who was named by Agrizzi "@abinetoshumba That's why there's over 3 @Ta Ras I don't think he's that stupid to be drinking 35 Born 1984 - makes him 35 @Niek tabl No he wasn't. It was a different Zuma @Luntu Jonginamba Don't be fooled by the advocates calm voice. He is a very sharp advocate. "@Luntu Jonginamba There's a saying @Tshwane Yamošate Yes "@Mlondolozi Msimango No @SABC Digital News Sound please @SABC Digital News Sound please @Gcina Mkhize They're back. I can see the picture but there's no sound. I did @Fezile Matsebula @Sabelo Zulu Yes he is. I am also amazed at Judge Zondo's excellent memory.

Mandla58,Hope you had a wonderful weekend What do you mean this crap ?
Pastor J.J,"@I Am Free And those that you miss to block @Anne M. That should jot be a problem. I bought a 3can special. @Rob Nel Maybe Tea and Samoosas. That will delay me too.hahahahahaha That is the water from the SANGOMA @Niek tabl That was Khulubuse Zuma. The fat fella @Niek tabl Why would you think that. I am retired. @Anne M. I fully agree with you. I think the beeeeeg one will come soon @Derek Main You are being extremely generous today my friend.
watson mutanga,"China is now a super power. It took the introduction and implementation of tough measures on corruption to get them on the right path "@Derek Main: Without drastic measures "For them
Alhadiah Khan,doom is not strong enough i think sangomas yes many many many money
Brighton Ncube,EWN live now
Tshotetsi Tlatlane,t This a.. holes are playing with us. Nothing makes sense here
Thulani Bukani,"I was wondering. Who do you guys think the Zumas spend more time with Tino blocked how many lawyers do you need?
Derek Main,"@watson mutanga As much as I'm opposed to the death penalty @watson mutanga I agree - we need a drastic solution. We need to get the corruption gene out of the gene pool. Tino blocked Does Dudzane still bend for the Guptas? @Jacob Selematsela I don't recall saying anything the number of lawyers he has - but I will say that an honest man doesn't need a lawyer. I was just wondering what he does for his blessers. Dudzane is a crook - like father like son. We all know full well that JZ just uses Dudzane as a front. He's a token businessman. @Jacob Selematsela Yes - that's because the entire ANC is corrupt to the core. @Jacob Selematsela I don't need to - it's all coming out anyway. @Johan Peens True that - they are beyond saving. Dudzane only has eyes for the Gupta brothers. @Samkelo Nxele I don't need to - the evidence is all coming out anyway. "@Damaking Alie If you can't see the mess "@Damaking Alie So @Heather Cotton It doesn't matter - he will never have enough. @Buyani Mhlongo Don't worry - Zuma is going to jail. @Buyani Mhlongo OK - you're on. @Buyani Mhlongo Either that or he'll pull a Watson and do us all a favour. @Wilhelm5381 ...if you're a Gupta. @Rob Nel Yep - the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. @Regina Phiri You must be a 30%er @Tshwane Yamošate Thando is not alone in that wish. Every thinking SAfn would like to see that happen. @Tshwane Yamošate I will - Zuma day is coming. @Tholithemba Ntsele Because we knew that a long time ago. We are not fools. @Tshwane Yamošate Yes - true. And soon my tax money will be paying for his jail stay. @Tholithemba Ntsele It's Obviaaas. @Tholithemba Ntsele By the mere fact that he is so closely associated with the Guptas and made all his money through them. Wake up! "@Thando Nkutha While I agree RE Ms Hofmeyer @Talia Owen You must be a 30%er. @Gcina Mkhize Except if he was ducking and diving and not making himself available. @Mvuzo Vundhla Even Agrizzi came across in the same way and look at what a criminal he is. Duduzane is just as guilty. @Keith Din At least you are thinking wisely about your vote - unlike the fool ANC voters. @Keith Din I also had the same thought but my ballot paper jumped up and slapped me. 😀 "@Bonang Sithole As Keith said
TUMELO NKWE,Aaaaagh this is just formality none of this guys is going to jail the sooner we accept reality the better
Hugo Kruger,are we live?
Christy,I already know Duduzane has been advised from his father not to remember or recall anything.
Rob Nel,"Are these guys EVER on time No money to pay techs He has this superior expression on his dial More like royal water The advocate is wasting his time. This guy is as slippery as his dad @dada ngova boarers?? "He is confident Wants to chat to his council

Thank you judge Makes no sense at all You or your uncle🤣🤣🤣 I just wanna point out that when men talk about us women the way people are salivating over Duduzani we call it sexual harassment and objectifying women. He has some arrogance I agree @Eric Singo He's even contradicting his uncle Fana @Eric Singo. 😂😂😂
Muzi Dube,Lol @ Derek I thought I would see Adv Sikhakane @Walls.. @Nomfundo....No lomfana uyashisa...Hunk of note.... This must be Ubaba's favorite son!!!!!

Trevor Martin,Tino you have a stuttering problem
Mahlasela Kilson,Duduzane is represent by WMC while his father tell the people to use black lawyers
wendy hardy,Zuma must have lots of money to pay all these lawyers!! Madumetja Moagi Why? This guy Zuma is so arrogant.
Deon Meyer,Let him speak for himself.These lawyers must go right NOW "Before Zuma begins "Zuma is a shareholder in the SA economy
makhosi nobhatyi,He must be asked questions Judge should not entertain objections question must be asked without fear or favor "@ Mzalwane Mzala we are interested to know @MSFviewer his mother passed away He started lying ngoku Uyalazi isela xa sele libhaqiwe libonakala limsulwa kodwa ngaphakathi kulo yingcuka We eat carry that is what I know about Saxonworld #mbalula Duduzane has no business deal except government?

Niek Cape Town,zuma's lawyers will object to ALL questions and the hearing will be cancelled as per his fathers 🤔 He is the one who was involved in buying a mine and stripping it of all equipment and letting the emplyees go hungry This shows his mentality
Siphiwe Masobelle,nothing but the truth first lie
Jacob Selematsela,@Derek Main remember that Zuma is a business shareholder in his own right and a businessman hence he can bring any lawyer he wants. For that matter is not bending for anyone my leader. Duduzane owns an IT company @Mzalwane Very strange cos the Guptas are actually friends to the ANC and all the Presidents of the ANC has worked with them @Derek Main you really seem to have so much corruption evidence against anyone else. why dont you go and give evidence at the corruption????? @Kagiso Mathole i echo your sentiments my leader. @Johan Peens lock him up for what now? has he been found guilty of any wrong doing????
Nthambe Mudau,hi everything said yes he's father said i forgott
Mzalwane Mzala,In which company is Zuma a shareholder? I thought the reference was to JZ. @Tee Makara That is why ladies who were sent by the DA to protest against him ended up taking selfies with him outside court. Hahaha Ordinary members of the ANC have no access to Luthuli House for their private meetings. He can't dodge this one. I thought Duduzane would read Fana Hlongwane's evidence to the PP. Jonas knew that they were going to meet Fana Hlongwane. The actual venue would have been not that important Zondo wants the aircon switched on while I have the heater on in my office
Willie Makena,Nelson Musoliwa. you so right

Humani Duncan,"Just by admitting the meeting happened and at the Gupta's residence "The puppy eyes don't fool me Him and the father have mastered lying like sport. "liar "To quote Judge Judy - ""If it doesn't make sense
Nelson Musoliwa,The guy look so innocence that i wish he can just say Sorry SA i will never do it again Duduzane might be regarded as a crook but he was not born a crook his father stupidity played a big role in his untoward behavior So far what matters is that he confirmed the meeting at Gupta residence the rest is up for graps

Joel Mkhabela,intellectual thug n criminal dd belong to jail its bit there s blind people here who ar not working but saying this guy s hot while we suffer bcos of this pple reckless behavior n doing
Wildthing,good curry there he is a shareholder and partner of Guptas so yes one part makes sense to have meeting there. but the Hotel should be the preferred venue. Did he use his fathers status to push the agenda.
Vic SetheMasewawatla,The evidence leader seems nervous.... free advertising @Ryan SA "@Norma Mzimela even a 7year old will ask I can imagine Fana jumping into the Merc... flying like Siperman Whoever thinks that the Zumas will 1 day go to jail must have their heads examined Do Pastors retire?

Lee D. Hendrix,...This is the non-responsiblity-guy that was driving the car that killed person(s) and no one was charged for it in Africa. He must have super law avoidance powers. ...Royalty is empowering corruption. ...A Nation is stripped of its prosperity by the persons in authority and by creating separation of a disoriented citizenry. "..Guile is not intelligence "...At this Time @Keith Din ..look at the global military bases and grasp the reality of what is. @Keith Din..sound reasoning eliminates products of postulation. ...IF the Guptas stole Trillions in USD from Africa and the Zumas comforted then why is there no expression of discomfort from the Zumas?
Slindile Ngcobo,Guptas residence is his house...hahaha @andre du plessis......take ur pick eish.....waste not waist @Setlabosego Lucky ....compared to urself? @Mlondolozi Msimango ....they on a COMFORT break cross eyed @Megan Lacey ...they've handcuffed DZ ready to take him to prison DZ is going to deny these allegations...lol DCJ excellent

Gontse Dikobe,he is a snack
Loyiso A. Jonase,Let us not worry about his character. The questions asked have nothing to do with him as a person but to link it to purpose and suspicion of state capture. All questions are relevant for commission. "Let us not worry about the water container. It does not give us answers and proof of state capture. The agenda is state capture not water bottle Am chilled Mrs. Anderson. I was just correcting something that has nothing to do with what is investigated. I want us to look and listen to facts that will prove state capture not water.
Teboho Maphakisa,What's up with the fancy bottle of water?
Pule Mokwana,lyk father lyk son.
Thabiso Lehloo,I think it will help the Counsel to stop making suppositions and to present facts otherwise he is going to come across as if he does not know his story Why does it matter that it was Duduzane and not anybody else who arranged the meeting How do you speak to a friend who goes around talking nonsense about you. Zondo and this lawyer are beginning to come across as if they have never done that. Nonsense this boy is going to show this lawyer flames @I Am Free then Jonas was not as wise as we thought he was Now the lawyer is confused about page numbers Alternate hypothesis "This lawyer is weak Asking wrong questions
Nick Smith-Chandler,Cyril is done if nobody goes to jail "Zuma has big balls
Khaya Nomoyi,Why would all these people lie about the presence of Guptas in these meetings?He even went to an extent of arranging a meeting between the Guptas and Ramathlodi. "But the content of the meeting was handled by the Guptas and not Duduzane. A young man arranging a meeting for older people He sips his water every time a difficult question is asked like dad. "Its too early Duduzane think he is smart with his useless version.Subsequent events will prove that Duduzane is lying especially the dismissal of Mr Nene. Arrogance at its best.This bubble is gonna burst. Its getting hot now with the curry. Its too early for comfort break.The last question caught him by surprise as someone who avail himself to sort people's differences. Badly advised because this was serious issue where a government official was being bribed in his presence by his business associates.
Talia Owen,I agree with you Ryan so very well spoken and highly intelligent .I love him so so much . "why all the hating for this smart young guy  "He is more than sexy 😍 "In SA there is no race thing  "People stop the hating for this young wonderful man  I love this smart young intelligent man wow I am truly getting to you guys I love that Thanks for educating some on comfort breaks

Tulonga Henoch,Mr Fana evidence will bang Dudu here Very calm lawyer Drinking Gin Saying nothing also lead to poor credibility as a witness Why do people come to have no comment at a commission if the commission do want the truth?
Wesley Van Der Heyde,Who received a call? Duduzane ro Jonas? surely that should be easily verifiable! Soooo.....we know he is drinking water...so why is the content of bottle advertised on it 🤔 Could it be that it is not as advertised?

Eric Singo,@Mr Jones Parke He is contradicting all Gupta brothers statement @Tholithemba Ntsele DZ is throwing all the Guptas brothers under the bus @Mr Jones Parker Birds of the same feathers.... @Pheladi Lamola His attitude is not helping him "@Trust Muzanya The problem is that he is going against his friends & 'enemies'. His version is against the Guptas & Jonas. So @MrTpma2009 DZ is already in deep problem @Mlamuli Makhula How is he beating them contradicting everyone including 'his friends' @Mvuzo Vundhla DZ is arrogant and stupid! @Siyabonga Mchunu So DZ is a product of WMC? @Mlamuli Makhula No they expected him to dispute Jonas and agree with the Guptas. But he is disagreeing with the Guptas and Uncle Fana Hlongwana. Zondo has no choice but to find against him! @TrendPaper-DUT DZ Accent. WMC. Pretoria Boys High.

Shut Up!!🙄 Duduzane Zuma is doing just fine💪 @Maruping Mosimanewakgomo define arrogance and tell me how it connects with what I said? How could this Jonas steps inside the car going to a meeting with Mr Zuma and not knowing where is the meeting going to be held??? @Maruping Mosimanewakgomo we are interested in both the truth and also being clear in telling the truth which requires him to fluent enough in english so he can be understood clearly @Tshwane Yamošate most definitely Here we go again 🙄🙄🙄 @Mathafeng Innocent Ntjanyana I think you need to shut up and listen to Mr Zuma's evidence @Maruping Mosimanewakgomo please don't reply no more son "@Tulonga Henoch some questions are used by lawyers as a trap
Mlamuli Makhula,@eric Singo he's not stupid. I mean they expected him to speak for Jonas and he posed the same question to them
TurtleShell 8024,@menzi zimele it sounds like that probably due to his fluency but he's not a lawyer. most of the questions are actually curved balls set to ensnare him in the latter stages. Michael Michael true!👍
Siyabonga Magwaza,Humility never pays the bills... Duduzane was just following his parents instruction.....you must respect your father Zuma Senior has short-distance intelligence Funny that even stupid people are still intelligent and intelligent people are still stupid....

Thank you for your sharpness judge Zondo @Damon Radebe: point taken but in future just have some tolerance with other people's views which differs with yours and never tell people in public to shut up because you assume they differ with you
