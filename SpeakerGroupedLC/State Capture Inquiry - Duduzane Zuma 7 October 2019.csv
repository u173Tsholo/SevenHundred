It was a different Zuma @Luntu Jonginamba Don't be fooled by the advocates calm voice. He is a very sharp advocate.

I can see the picture but there's no sound. I did @Fezile Matsebula @Sabelo Zulu Yes he is. I am also amazed at Judge Zondo's excellent memory.

Pastor J.J,"@I Am Free And those that you miss to block @Anne M. That should jot be a problem. I bought a 3can special. @Rob Nel Maybe Tea and Samoosas. That will delay me too.hahahahahaha That is the water from the SANGOMA @Niek tabl That was Khulubuse Zuma. The fat fella @Niek tabl Why would you think that. I am retired. @Anne M. I fully agree with you. I think the beeeeeg one will come soon @Derek Main You are being extremely generous today my friend.
watson mutanga,"China is now a super power. It took the introduction and implementation of tough measures on corruption to get them on the right path "@Derek Main: Without drastic measures "For them
Alhadiah Khan,doom is not strong enough i think sangomas yes many many many money
Brighton Ncube,EWN live now
Tshotetsi Tlatlane,t This a.. holes are playing with us. Nothing makes sense here
Thulani Bukani,"I was wondering. Who do you guys think the Zumas spend more time with Tino blocked how many lawyers do you need?
Derek Main,"@watson mutanga As much as I'm opposed to the death penalty @watson mutanga I agree - we need a drastic solution. We need to get the corruption gene out of the gene pool. Tino blocked Does Dudzane still bend for the Guptas? @Jacob Selematsela I don't recall saying anything the number of lawyers he has - but I will say that an honest man doesn't need a lawyer. I was just wondering what he does for his blessers. Dudzane is a crook - like father like son. We all know full well that JZ just uses Dudzane as a front. He's a token businessman. @Jacob Selematsela Yes - that's because the entire ANC is corrupt to the core. @Jacob Selematsela I don't need to - it's all coming out anyway. @Johan Peens True that - they are beyond saving. Dudzane only has eyes for the Gupta brothers. @Samkelo Nxele I don't need to - the evidence is all coming out anyway. "@Damaking Alie If you can't see the mess "@Damaking Alie So @Heather Cotton It doesn't matter - he will never have enough. @Buyani Mhlongo Don't worry - Zuma is going to jail. @Buyani Mhlongo OK - you're on. @Buyani Mhlongo Either that or he'll pull a Watson and do us all a favour. @Wilhelm5381 ...if you're a Gupta. @Rob Nel Yep - the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. @Regina Phiri You must be a 30%er @Tshwane Yamo≈°ate Thando is not alone in that wish. Every thinking SAfn would like to see that happen. @Tshwane Yamo≈°ate I will - Zuma day is coming. @Tholithemba Ntsele Because we knew that a long time ago. We are not fools. @Tshwane Yamo≈°ate Yes - true. And soon my tax money will be paying for his jail stay. @Tholithemba Ntsele It's Obviaaas. @Tholithemba Ntsele By the mere fact that he is so closely associated with the Guptas and made all his money through them. Wake up! "@Thando Nkutha While I agree RE Ms Hofmeyer @Talia Owen You must be a 30%er. @Gcina Mkhize Except if he was ducking and diving and not making himself available. @Mvuzo Vundhla Even Agrizzi came across in the same way and look at what a criminal he is. Duduzane is just as guilty. @Keith Din At least you are thinking wisely about your vote - unlike the fool ANC voters. @Keith Din I also had the same thought but my ballot paper jumped up and slapped me. üòÄ "@Bonang Sithole As Keith said
TUMELO NKWE,Aaaaagh this is just formality none of this guys is going to jail the sooner we accept reality the better

Siphiwe Masobelle,nothing but the truth first lie
Jacob Selematsela,@Derek Main remember that Zuma is a business shareholder in his own right and a businessman hence he can bring any lawyer he wants. For that matter is not bending for anyone my leader. Duduzane owns an IT company @Mzalwane Very strange cos the Guptas are actually friends to the ANC and all the Presidents of the ANC has worked with them @Derek Main you really seem to have so much corruption evidence against anyone else. why dont you go and give evidence at the corruption????? @Kagiso Mathole i echo your sentiments my leader. @Johan Peens lock him up for what now? has he been found guilty of any wrong doing????
Nthambe Mudau,hi everything said yes he's father said i forgott
Mzalwane Mzala,In which company is Zuma a shareholder? I thought the reference was to JZ. @Tee Makara That is why ladies who were sent by the DA to protest against him ended up taking selfies with him outside court. Hahaha Ordinary members of the ANC have no access to Luthuli House for their private meetings. He can't dodge this one. I thought Duduzane would read Fana Hlongwane's evidence to the PP. Jonas knew that they were going to meet Fana Hlongwane. The actual venue would have been not that important Zondo wants the aircon switched on while I have the heater on in my office

Loyiso A. Jonase,Let us not worry about his character. The questions asked have nothing to do with him as a person but to link it to purpose and suspicion of state capture. All questions are relevant for commission. "Let us not worry about the water container. It does not give us answers and proof of state capture. The agenda is state capture not water bottle Am chilled Mrs. Anderson. I was just correcting something that has nothing to do with what is investigated. I want us to look and listen to facts that will prove state capture not water.

Pule Mokwana,lyk father lyk son.
Thabiso Lehloo,I think it will help the Counsel to stop making suppositions and to present facts otherwise he is going to come across as if he does not know his story Why does it matter that it was Duduzane and not anybody else who arranged the meeting How do you speak to a friend who goes around talking nonsense about you. Zondo and this lawyer are beginning to come across as if they have never done that.

Khaya Nomoyi,Why would all these people lie about the presence of Guptas in these meetings?He even went to an extent of arranging a meeting between the Guptas and Ramathlodi. "But the content of the meeting was handled by the Guptas and not Duduzane. A young man arranging a meeting for older people He sips his water every time a difficult question is asked like dad. "Its too early Duduzane think he is smart with his useless version.Subsequent events will prove that Duduzane is lying especially the dismissal of Mr Nene. Arrogance at its best.This bubble is gonna burst. Its getting hot now with the curry. Its too early for comfort break.The last question caught him by surprise as someone who avail himself to sort people's differences. Badly advised because this was serious issue where a government official was being bribed in his presence by his business associates.
