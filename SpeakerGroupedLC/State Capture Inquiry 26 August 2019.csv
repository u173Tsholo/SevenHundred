Robert Russell,goeie more almal Dizzy comes to mind DCJ is going to postpone this witness And you actuality spell it BLONDE Minister Chabane was one of the VERY FEW honest ANC cabinet ministers eNCA is covering the story and it seems ligit that it is Gavin Watson Even if Gavin Watson is dead...... the Asset Forfeiture unit should not stop trying to get back OUR stolen money from his estate Oh and OUR stolen money from the ANC donations as well
jose billa,goie more Russel

Karabo Lloyd,more lies are coming here we go
Mulunghisi Mulunghisi,who is this who suppose to witness today
Pastor J.J,Does anyone know when SUPER LIAR #1 and Thief in Chief is appearing again?????? Something gives me the impression so far that Ms Buthelezi has now got some stiff competition with this Advocate. @Sindiswa Moolman It seems like a lot about nothing so far. But I suspect that something beeeeeg is about to hit the fan....... This Advocate seems very nervous @Thando Nkutha .hahahahaha. I suspected that due to the spelling being so correct this time around. hahahaha SABC HAS REPORTED THAT THE ACCIDENT IS BEING TREATED AS SUSPICIOUS. @Niek tabl ?
Thandekile Nkosiyane,im waiting for Mr Zuma to go to jail
Modise Shongwe,i like the tone of this white lady madona
Glorify Gumede,iBlondie yini? umlungu Mr Mathethwa cishe uMthethwa lowo Khulibusi ngiyacabanga uKhulubuse lowo Antionette what does Blond mean? is it equivalent to saying white female? @Antoinette Rader what is your answer? i'm asking seriously So it's just the hair ? none So it's a problem that i didn't know? The evidence leader is butchering names there but its ok @Robert Russell noted and i guess you didn't see my other concern about the Blonde lady She has almost pronounced all the names wrongly How can one get Mthethwa wrong lol @Missie really? if you say so fruits? what is this witness on about i didn't know Shabane smoked M in the Presidency nah i doubt remember he was always with people playing music So it's probably us the public that din't know i doubt he liked smoking like Mbeki Mbeki and his long pipe will even smoke in parliament lol gov communications services i think its the comm depart of gov Maseko was head thanks Mohale for correction yes over and above that he has also mentioned Manyi
wendy hardy,Get with the program lady!
Recreate YOU Life Coaching and Image Consulting,when are we going to see people as people and not according to colour? We need to evolve South Africa...we are standing in our own way! Guys we have waited and fought for democracy. This is the very same division and discrimination that have brought us to this point. We are a diverse nation. instead of c "instead of criticizing differences
Antoinette Rader,Really Thando.......Grow up. BS Glorify Blond means fair hair. Even I know that:))
carnoth ngomane,Is this lady nervous or not prepared The legal team of the commission always not prepared @Thando Nkutha he wants the whole pie not a piece "@Thando Nkutha its in our nature @Thando Nkutha with JZ anything is possible "@Derek Main very fishy indeed @Anne M. yeah but they might pin everything on him now that he cant speak for himself @Thando Nkutha im thinking along the same line "@Derek Main if they all do that we will never know the truth "@Makwa Choma just look and analyse the voters demographics "@Makwa Choma yes its an open secret
vincent kganyago,Zondo is trying to be calm but angry deep down
Pheladi Lamola,Someone is sabotaging this commission. We can't be dealing with this issue all the time. People need to receive this rule 33 notices in time but there's always stories. Gavin Watson Sindiswa Car crash apparently 😂😂 Yes Sindiswa. We want our money back please. Zuma lied. "Agreed @Derek Main. If the Hawks and NPA had done their jobs Let them kill each other.
Sarender Rekhotho,I`m watching from University Of Limpopo. and i`ve no idea as to what is actually going on. smoke
Norm phum Takalani,it's heppenning in SA this time
Amen Ndlovu,eish in South Africa
Sindiswa Moolman,I think the problem is the Chairs hearing. The Chair is really losing his hearing What is he saying? Thanks @Pastor J. Won’t be surprised if JZ accuses this man of being the agent of the enemy after all this testimony. "But not Watson  That’s can only be a suicide then @Philadi Lamola It’s confirmed... it’s Gavin Watson He drove to a concrete barrier @TG Swartlane Bosasa's Gavin Watson has died ... #POWERTalk The AFU must start the asset forfeiture before they go to the beneficiaries. That may sound cold but we need our monies back. Watson wanted to die. Why was he driving a Toyota Corolla when he could have driven a Porsche EWN @Hosia Modiga. Hi to Twitter... it’s buzzing there too Go to Twitter @Hosia Modiga No@Thando Nkutha. He killed himself. Yes @Derek Main He drove to a concrete barrier @Thando Nkutha. ... R21 It’s my take... Brett Kebble didn’t leave a note @Thando Nkutha Yes... I agree @Thandi Nkutha Also read EWN @Niek tabi. They mentioned the name there PowerFM also did @Niek tabi Watch eNCA @Niek tabi. Hahaha... @ Thando Nkutha. Really? Are you serious @Thando Nkutha? Who needs to confirm that @Magda Seguin when 4 media houses have already done so? Hahahaha @Thando Nkutha Sho @Thando Nkutha Yhooo...@Thando Nkutha. I think all these deaths must be investigated. Thanks a lot got this info Mhmmm... @Thando Nkutha JZ thought the commission won’t verify his testimony It seems he chose his weapon carefully. My question exactly @Kenneth Rooubaard I agree... @Kenneth Rooibaard
Nonzy,Chair is losing his hearing batho educate ourselves in what exactly? Aubrey you are not rude but irritating. I will have to block you
Vic SetheMasewawatla,I also cannot hear what the witness is saying.. Smoke?? Is that even allowed for Ministers to smoke? "So far we've heard Smoke So are we going to ignore that fact that Gavin Wason was driving a Toyota Corolla?
Matome Mampa,Maybe the fruits part is an introduction to the Tsunami he's going to unleash
Lorraine Naidoo,fis nd sips somebody tampered with that car executive of Haven watson eih dead men says no tails
frans mofomadi,too much details
makhosi nobhatyi,Zuma has to account we are looking that now Manyi and Zuma came here and lie where there is smoke there is fire Indeed @ Magda Seguin Next witness is going to lie here 🙆🏻‍♀️ Hlungwana 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ isn’t Guptas puppet? Oh yes let’s hope he is not going to lie @ Derek main "@ Sindiswa Moolman is true? If so may his soul Rest In Peace Record will speak itself 💃💃💃 Gavin Watson runs before get his 15 years Gangster state 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ True @ Thabani Trevor
vas Michaelides,alone or a loan car 😛
Lowkey Apparel,Minister smoked? What if minister was hiding his smoking habit and now this mampara is exposing him i hope we(taxpayers) didn't pay for the minister's cigarettes
Buti Sipho,Collins Chabane empty hall 🤦‍♀️
Magda Seguin,The Zondo commission is a year old already I watched most of the commission in direct and is getting worried how much longer it will take WoW! thanks @Anne M. He is corraborating Mr Maseko's testimony True @Ibo Thabo "The Seriti commission had a completely different mandate Andrew Feinstein who was an ANC parliamentarian resigned ans wrote a book called 'After the Party' he relates the arms deal shenanigens in his book With the public and NGOs knowing about the failed Seriti commission all the minute details of the Zondo commission will be disected.There is no room for biass Spot on @Anne M. Another one who was not honest was Bruce Khoalane The testimonies of the witness today is very important as they worked inside the presidency Abednego is a biblical name...lets hear the truth..lol I was just joking @Ibo Thabo "Yes "His driver was speeding at night on a national roadster It cant be Agrizzi...the headline says Bosasa exécutive...Agrizzi resigned years ago SABC just announced that it is Gavin Watson who died With all the political killings I sometimes want to be a conspiracy theorist.... The body has NOT been confirmed as Gavin Watson's...news24 says there are too many 'strange things' surrounding the car "For starters The body has NOT bern identified yet I just saw viduqls of the car..the front is totalled Wait for a confirmation that it is indeed Gavin Watson So the mortuary confirmed that it is Gavin Watson....I will only believe it if I see his body...too many political killings in SA and in Africa.The scene is already sanitised. There is an argument among news agencies of confirmation of Watsons death and if it was really him...Twitter is aflush with his death yet there is NO CREDIBLE confirmation that it is him
Jan Davies,Remember taxpayers are paying for their co "Cigarettes
Simo Majola,@Tshwane Yamošate Lol Lol 😀 Zondo Fish and Chips Commission
Anne M.,@Magda Seguin DCJ said in the interview he's going to ask for an extension. @Ibo Thabo Agree @Kabelo Katjedi Do you think Judge Zondo won't deliver a fair report? "@Pastor J Yes @Ibo Thabo Possibly to lull the witness into saying more than they want to? "@Kabelo Katjedi If we as non legal people can see through the lies and BS of some of the witnesses @Ibo Thabo You're right. All this evidence is now a public record. "@Magda Seguin Hmmm @carnoth ngomane There are other Bosasa directors that can still be called. "If I was innocent
Mashao Mohale,GCIS: Government Communication Information Systems
Ibo Thabo,@Magda Seguin Mr Zondo recently hint that might take over a year to go and I think is really worthy of it. Most of the time those against the commission is people want hid things. Why can’t the commission have all in & out calls & conversation correspondence in the presidency? Why the commission can’t have all call records of the Guptas? @Anne M. Sometimes I have questions for the intelligence or sharpness of Mr Zondo "@Anne M. No @Anne M. I guess that is why even top law experts like Sikhakhane didn’t want Zuma to utter more nonsense when then later will hunt him 2/2 Why don’t the commission asked the phone records between Zuma & minister Chabane? "we need the full records of this call Zuma keep harassing and intimidating anyone dare to say something against him and he is using those 100% Z boys placard holders to do his dirty work which then surely will say he know nothing about what zondow is looking for these question he is asking now? Why doesn’t he ask for the phone records? Why Zondow never asked Zuma the similar question on why he remember something happened near 30 years ago in details? what you mean?@Yolo More @Yolo More My question is why didn’t Zondow sick to connect the dots on Zuma when he gave details of things happened 30 years ago? @Yolo More Why can’t CJ simplify the issue and simply called up the phone records of this guy in these days?
Kabelo Katjedi,"Does Zondo knows hw much is wasted in this commission mara gave "ANNE M he might deliver a fair report bt based on the testimonies or statements frm different witnesses "ANNE fair enough  "Just wondering whos nxt onthe list "Makwa i was born after apartheid but i have experienced racial remarks to a point whereby it goes viral on social media Thando doesnt want to pay 500 000 mis-interpretation
Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,when this guy comes back. I foresee sparks...
funicanz,@Magda Seguin 😆😆 Minister Chabane died too soon. "@Thando Nkutha  "@Sindiswa Moolman  "@Sindiswa Moolman 
TG Swartlane,"@Pheladi apparently it’s true Do you reckon @Sindi?😳🙆🏽‍♂️ "Mortuary has confirmed
Derek Main,@makhosi nobhatyi Different guy I think. Fana Hlongwane was the bag man for the arms deal. This guy testifying was in the Office of Presidency working for Chabane. @Thando Nkutha Wouldn't put it past him. RE Gavin Watson - that's very fishy. I smell a rat. The criminals must be very happy Seems almost like a Brett Kebble suicide. @Makwa Choma No thinking person can understand that. The fact is Gavin Watson should have been in jail ages ago - before he could do himself any harm. @Pheladi Lamola Yeah - they both got off too easily. @Sindiswa Moolman Ala Brett Kebble? I wish all the corrupt would do the same. "@Kabelo Katjedi Yes you do - if you think no other parties are worthwhile

DJ DJ,Watch this space Gavin Watson was murdered Watson was on his way to the airport when the accident happened The car belonged to Bosasa
Yolo More,Was the lawyer his or of Absa Bank Thando Nkutha? So no one will give evidence on the snakes and chicken braai packs and booze? Gucci bags too. And he didn't want to write his statement on the allegations.Why? As if he knew he will be gone by the time he is subpoenaed. 'Bosasa gave Zuma R100 000 every month' """Nomvula Nonkonyane was given chicken and beers'" "' Gwede ' Nomgcobo Jiba was given a brown envelope.'

Francois Cape Town,They better put some armed guards at that mortuary. Just now Watson inexplicably wakes up and flies out to Dubai via Waterkloof Air Force base on one of the Gupta planes fueled and paid for by ex No 1
