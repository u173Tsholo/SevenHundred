HALO,Bring an end to the anc Anc = African national corruption There will be no arrests They all in the same boat As long as anc is in charge this country will always have it's public resources stolen. "Yes How can government allow the seizing of farmland without compensation? CORRUPTION! Caucasians are from Europe They will answer for their crimes after the body dies and they are in the JUDGEMENT! Vengeance belongs to The Lord. These criminals will receive the appropriate consequences for their actions. Ramaphosa is Ramapoes cyril ramaPOESa Whoever votes for anc has no right to complain about corruption because it has been known for too many years that anc is severely corrupted. Jacob* "We know that Jacob Zuma was stealing money "But hey people "This world will end and a new world will be born. All of this corrupted society will never last All manner of unholy sinful behaviour and creations will be eradicated. The Lord's will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. DA is anc's biggest competition and I think those who realise this make DA to be anti-african i.e pro-aparthied. They think whatever opposes anc must be racist. When will they see the deception.. How many empty promises Zuma gave?? So many people wore t shirts with his face on it and yet we find that he is a treacherous thief. Even after Zuma people still support anc...BRAINWASHED! "Someone here is getting offended. Are you aware that if you try to be a righteous leader there is a high chance you will get killed? Recently a Saudi ""prince"" ordered a hitman squad to kill a guy" One righteous person can send out the messages of truth but its all the civilians that have to put in effort. "Alot of people dont see the hardcore nature of many politicians because people are too busy being brainwashed by pop culture media Fix your priorities The end of the age is closer than we think Repent your sins. Love. I'm trying to make people aware But they treat politicians like celebrities and treat celebrities like gods There is only one Lord. You best recognize the creations of The Lord and recognize the beauty and majesty of The Lord's glory. People are destroying many wonderful creations. So much to learn even for me.. Just seek the Lord and seek truth and wisdom. PRAY. And seek The Lord with all your heart. Also stop sinning.

Dominic Przybylski,"See article in news24 today - ""Nicole Fritz | We have become used to the ANC's cruelty""" Being corrupt is more than reasonable if there is no accountability. The worst people are those who made sure there is no accountability - Zuma and Ramaphosa come to mind. Policy of cadre deployment is aimed at state capture. No other explanation I can think of. @Zakhele Tshabalala You assume politicians can solve our problems when it is they who have created them. The solution is to get rid of the politics and for us as individuals to take responsibility. Reduce the size and scope of government for a start. Work on helping people to regain their self-esteem. When people have self-respect they don't allow others to take them for a ride. "@jasper dougal This corruption is based on soviet style communist rule where ""collective responsibility"" means nobody is accountable." @Inspiration Afri In case you didn't notice we are governed by South African Communist Party together with ANC. @Inspiration Afri Let me answer your question with one of my own. Name one programme aimed at strengthening a free-market economy. @Inspiration Afri Nice try but it's all talk and no action. The action is more like increasing tariffs on imported chicken if you want to look at international trade. Now we have to pay 50% more. @Inspiration Afri Until we are all in one customs union african trade is international trade because excise duties are payable. @Inspiration Afri please try to find out what capitalism is - There are plenty of free economics courses. "@Inspiration Afri Just because you live in a capitalist country does not mean you understand what it is. Google ""basic economics explained""" "@Inspiration Afri Capitalism definition -""an ECONOMIC and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit Anybody who is not in government. @Inspiration Afri At last I can agree with you - money is not capitalism. lol @Sidney P Jesus already came back but nobody noticed.
