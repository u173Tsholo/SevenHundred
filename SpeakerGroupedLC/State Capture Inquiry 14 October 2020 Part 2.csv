Sanjay Maharaj,I have found that with ZA black Africans the boss is always referred to as no.1. was not sure where that originated. now I know. who is this witness? "@SanFran "if I was 2IC to the boss "@mzawalane "@Mzalwane is an Italian still holds an Italian passport.

Sabeliwe Mavundla,Alfred 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mzalwane Mzala,The state opposes bail for Agrizzi @Sanjay Maharaj Agrizzi did not declare assets that are valued in Millions and some of these are in foreign countries. Agrizzi handed over to the state a South African passport in his first case but did not reveal that he is also a holder of an Italian passport. The decision on the bail has not been made yet. He recently transferred about 11 Million Rands to Italy. I am still questioning why was Agrizzi allowed to auction his house last week. @Sekgololo Johannes MTN also sold BEE shares to ordinary black people I still hold Sasol BEE shares that were sold to ordinary black people I agree @wim louw Agrizzi is a flight-risk. The case of the VBS CFO is a stark reminder that state witness can be given a custodial sentence. Agrizzi knows this. Trump's victory in 2016 is another reminder that people vote in elections based on a variety of reasons. I find it strange when some in South Africa expect us to vote based only on what they hold dear
Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ,hi-0✋🏽 though ...... "...in the previous live stream...I said Hi-0 ✋🏽 ....and then couldn't find the link 🍎🐛 ag rizzi .....so he was an Italian? was..now he is South Citizen 😳 Italy "...there's one Italian in india Como and Pelosi are Italians that undermine the Government of the United States of America Mafia al-capone [ loud whistle ] woooooooo. yerrrrr man is it? why you can't be competent and put your affairs on a state channel "For your incompetence "This is a live chat "Then YOU people "as I was saying "🤔 I was thinking You pipol Ay you pipol..still backward ".....note  "the mob I'm none off those.

I seen it here 🤔 Everyday I come here... because I'm unemployed and got nothing better to do.......and you'll tell me Zuma is coming tomorrow ..and everyday he is not here. when is he coming?
Diana Sekatane,yes Mzala he didn't disclose crucial information. "This animal called 3bee must be stopped on it's tracks correct Johannes. "I feel pity for people who worked directly under these corrupt predators Rox Agrizzi has health issues. It was one of the reason to blow the whistle.. to off load. Simmy correct together with Gavin Watson. "The witness seat is really hot People are selling their souls for dirty money and compromising their professions and losing their self worth and identity. What was so special with this Gama guy? Rox due to his corrupt nature that is why they want him to come and loot more.
