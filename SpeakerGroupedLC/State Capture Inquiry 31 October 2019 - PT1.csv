He is agreeing without understanding where she is heading. Sounds like this guy was imminently unqualified for the job of director at Eskom. No surprise because that's why he was appointed. Granit Xhaka BLOCKED Eliot Chauke ​They removed Maleka because he Represented EFF in court. Please send the reference for this fact. Eliot Chauke ​They removed Maleka because he Represented EFF in court. I think this is BS. @ Eliot Chauke Maleka Shoul aplologise for spreading BS. But you were part of the board... Eliot Chauke ​Leave Mr Molefe alone Why Eliot?

Ibo Thabo,Our economy is not performing and we are growing at a rate so pedestrian that we find the revenue declining. We have seen an increase in retrenchments and an increase in retirement. 1/2 "2/2 All these compounded by the fact that Sars has been rendered less than optimally capable to collect revenue leads us to the situation we find ourselves. — Edward Kieswetter "one of the direct consequences of state capture is that general society now feels it has permission to become lawless. By Edward Kieswetter We are seeing increases in VAT fraud and pay as you earn fraud in addition to the normal compliance challenges. 1/2 2/2 This is all a function of a society that has lost confidence in the system and given itself permission to buck the law @He lives in you Why we still people in the country particularly following this Zondo inquiry saying I am 100% Z boy?
