Quinton van Eeden,mornin folks 🙂 @Diane Louw - looks like we are the early birds 🙂 pse assist - was Singh actually present yesterday? "@Diane Louw - ta @Heather Durr - yeah but I think that @Dawn Britz - agree - that attorney knows his stuff the DCJ is in a hurry this morning where is this heading? did they appoint some unqualified cadre eventually? @ALTA 🌻 @Pastor J.J 🙏 @Heather Durr - ahhh starting to see the light - not quite up to date with all the screwings and doings of the Ewings (SA edition) @R Bauer - simple matter to get your mate in IT to bounce co e-mails to your private e-mail with a re-direct on Exchange @Heather Durr - any update on what happened subsequently with the corruption & high treason charges against Seleke? @Heather Durr - nope me also on the water cart - have been forever 🙂 - explains my lack of empathy and high-tuned nose for detecting BS @Heather Durr - in a previous discussion you referred to Hodes - is that Max because then I've also had the distinct displeasure to have him on the opposing team @Heather Durr - my age is showing 🙂 this lady knows her stuff - a very competent government mandarin rationalising her course of action wish someone would ask her how she knew that it was Zuma that she spoke to (to address Heather's concern above) @Louis van Coppenhagen - familie van Linda? "@peter ntloge - Seleka made the mistake of attributing the same level of professional behaviour that he adheres to @Heather Durr ditto Stage 2 load-shedding starting again from 12:00 today "@Lerato Moleke - the cool thing with Todd is that he knows how to paint the big picture @Thembelani Mangena - think he is with Bowmans
Diane Louw,Morning Quinton yes we are lol yes he was Quinton I totally agree Heather pity he is not like that with those that testify and their lawyers..... morning mathys moring Teunis and Dawn and Antoinette and Louis C i think his team let him down to be honest and he took the lashing... hi lerato morning to all the newbies i dont see moving pictures - hw are you seeing it Shame man tell her to relax and breathe..... hi pastor jj and ALTA lol pastor j j "you know what so they cut her out of the process from the start hello hello Zuma phoned her proves Zuma was kept informed of the goings on hi naledi from a very hot hot cape town hi valencia j "agree Valencia J and it was on the basis that the next day after the summons issued ditto heather "during ""the deep dive"" whats that" valencia go to your settings and people and unblock him lucky you marcus way to go Alta im inclined to go that why too why - way skink dames skink @ Alta and Naledi thanks Naledi..... interesting ag nee ALTA ja we go off at 20h00 tonight very ALTA and i think its also got a lot to do with the commission re witness that is due imho  agree Louis C and Quinton lekker eet that was genuine DCJ believes this lady hence he asking the ?? jip for sure so we know Molefe got Singh into Eskom.... that was the meeting that she attended on the 11th with essa and gupta
Heather Durr,@Quinton van Eeden @Diane Louw Hi there-Poor Seleka and DCJ were crucified on Twitter yesterday. DCJ was too harsh and the RET brigade jump on any reason to trash Zondo Not 'chair' @Lerato Moleke Well I had my 'historic' Bday on the same day Trump made history @Louis C Molefe is tomorrow assuming he doesn't pull a 'Singh'it is a pity they can't question him about Transnet  @Louis C To get away with what they did so brazenly at Transnet is nauseating but at least we know Lynne Browns name comes up all the time Not the aircon AGAIN DCJ Moving along.......... She is a Whistleblower isn't she Ah a Trillion Whisteblower acc to EWN @ALTA Hi my liefie DCJ Is decidedly hoarse Ugh Loadshedding and I am up so early to do my workout in front of CNN @Stix Mtolo Hi there @Pastor J.J Where are you hiding @Quinton van Eeden They wanted Seleke in that position Probably why Adv Seleka wanted to ensure they got his surname correct "#Koko must be listening intently after he was so 'flubberghasted I wonder if Koko will be able to resist his Hubris and Tweet about this specific policy after the articles about his burning chest  Not Pretorius... @Quinton van Eeden Not that I have seen Am I the only teetotaler here "I do feel their pain-I have a highly addictive nature like training in front of the TV so I dont bore myself to death and I never drank beer only shots-I got drunk vey quickly and painkillers in anticipation of the migraine to follow @Quinton van Eeden No Leonard his son but cut from the same cloth @Stix Mtolo LOLOL That's hilarious . I just drink spring water and liquifruit @zip reeper you are not far off from some of the cults @Helene Nortje Ja-Do a search of her name and add Whistleblower @Stix Mtolo Fake News on Google who list her as one of 2 Whistleblowers BOOM BOOM @Anthony Fourie You can leave the chat @Naledi Barron Dahling Question-How did she know it was Zuma/ because he will deny it was him as will the RET branch "@Diane Louw Yes he did @Lerato Moleke Heck yes-Twitter was savage @Valencia J Hi there Non lawyers with respect will have no idea how minor that point was. No self respecting lawyer would take that point. Only the ones in the mud @Teunis van Ree they will all learn as after 2 years such minor shait really slips thru the cracks Clearly I have blocked Power-cant see it People are so precious about their titles and roles @Naledi Barron Agreed-she clearly takes pride in her work and is very professional Singh and Cruella are truly deserving of each other yesterday with Adv Myburgh was Mindblowing Awwwwwwwwww prime time TV Slot-go for it DCJ @Lerato Moleke He is sooo watching this avidly if not clutching at his tranquillisers Thats lunchtime gone.DCJ is on a roll. Bless Him @Lerato Moleke The people's advocate-he loves that pretence KABOOM Love it

If you talk to him ask about what the poor VBS pensioners ate for Christmas @Valencia J Greetings Darling. They must pay back the stolen money. @Valencia J You should also explain to him that using the K word 15 times the other day is a form of abuse. @Valencia J absolutely. Did that for about 2 hours non stop @Valencia J Yu are forgiven in advance. @Valencia J Combination of Goat/Donkey and a few other things @Power Electronics Bless you. @Willie Truter Brilliant. hahahahahaha

Peter Jeftha,they were thought well but not so well wen ask about E-mail coz they had no idea at first now they are so called experts 
R Bauer,@Gugulethu Xhosans It sounds more like she's talking more about enabling work email on private devices and allowing wifi access to gmail at work for example. @Gugulethu Xhosans Gmail would be blocked on the internet access at work to discourage people from using private email. @Gugulethu Xhosans People like to check all their emails in one place. It's a dumb way to do it but people demand to do it how they want.
