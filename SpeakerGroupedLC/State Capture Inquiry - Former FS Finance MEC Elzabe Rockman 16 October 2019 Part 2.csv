Daysman Mestile,welcome
phibion chenyika,"This lady
makhosi nobhatyi,She is being caught 😂😂😂😃 @ Derek main she was told by her boss that project will carry on "😂😂😃😃 hey these guys they don’t play tjoo @ Derek main "I am praying NPA We want all thugs to go to jail doesn’t matter how big you are "@ Heather Cotton I don’t worry much about them sitting there at ANC headquarters but we will get them Remember those who worked for these people senior and investigators are still inside the department so first clean inside then run trials Nowonder Duduzane is doing business with whom coz I believe they were targeting government now his dad is out
Derek Main,"If she approved the finances for Estina @makhosi nobhatyi I think all FS officials fear for their lives when dealing with Mr 10%. @makhosi nobhatyi I don't blame them - people have already been killed for exposing corruption in FS. It's been run by a true gangster for years now. @makhosi nobhatyi I'd rather they take their time and get it right instead of having the cases thrown out of court for lack of evidence or bad investigation. @Diana Sekatane I agree - corruption knows no colour. The guilty must face the consequences. @Phill Rambau I'll take a guess that she is an ANC member. It was clear that she was corrupt the minute she said that the New Age subscription by FS government was above board. There is no denying that there was corruption under the Nat government but the ANC have taken it to an entirely new level. They have perfected corruption. "@David Tuer I don't think she's come out clean. Seems like she just shirked her responsibilities. If she was part of treasury with oversight @David Tuer Of course - deal with all the guilty. From what I've heard she did the barest minimum (and maybe not even that). @David Tuer She had a responsibility to flag any indications that money was not being used for the intended purpose and didn't. @Frans Phala I would be scared if I was her - Mr 10% is a gangster thug. @David Tuer I can't argue with that but that's very close to the argument that we should first deal with apartheid corruption before we worry about current corruption. All the guilty have to be punished. @David Tuer Well hopefully we'll make sushi of the snake. @Lady Bird I have to agree with that. The proof of the success will be the number of people going to jail. It can't just be another Seriti commission. "@Tholithemba Ntsele Yes - you're right but if people don't go to jail
Jabu Malinga,this lady is lik duduzane..guilty for listening to ter bosses and doin wront things to keep ter jobs this lady is beatin around d bush. answering things with confusion. no oversight "Makhosi "Anne
Diana Sekatane,"kuzoba lit It was very nice when they were doing corruption but now it's very difficult to substantiate what they have done with the taxpayers millions. @Paul collectively yes... @ Jabu let's have a bit of patience the puzzle will unravel itself. Investigators must be under raps because this fightback will be dealing with them. @Anne no.. @Anne remember USA is acting as the police of the world @Anne the capture was everywhere especially the law enforcement. "corruption knows no colour @i am free what are trying to say? "@i am free numbers don't lie Those who are found to be wanting must face the full might of the law period. The was money owed by the S. A government under apartheid which was to be serviced by the democratic government. @lady bird no. @lady bird fooled you how? Who said is not important... corruption is as old as humankind.
Easy D,Exactly @ Diana Sekatane "Ms Rockman will be heading straight to the pub after this session of questioning absolutely right @ Lady bird..

rosalind gerber,bean curry and UAE? @Diana Sekatane what money was owing? thanks - how silly what for power stations and railways?
Cruda Bex,Zondo afrikaans pls
KC,"zondo your sound quality is fading when truth is been told
Lee D. Hendrix,......She knows nothing about what a cattle-farm consist of and was placed in that position to effect an illicit cash flow. The ride should have been nice at the taxpayers' expense. "...I have the best excuses and if you pay me  ...Corrupted minds consider themselves as what someone suggest they are and form groups of separated ethnicity. This is the psychology for controlling the masses.
Emanuel Nduhiye,mambo ni motto
Alhadiah Khan,dudu zuma gave jonas a lift from the hotel to guptas res.jonas security was bypassed.after meeting dudu walked Jonas outside to give him a lift.dudu offered lift to the airport or cowtrain. why did dudu nt give him a lift back to the hotel to his security. surprising.

Norman Zwane,"@Carnoth Ngomane I have not believed her either "@Derek Main In my other life I use to run a business. I often found that after sacking one of my key managers
clive oconnell,One so blind that don’t want to see Corruption
Mongezi Mzobe,corruption corruption to the ANC they taking SA to the drein
David Tuer,This lady has been put through the ringer and I think has come out pretty well unscathed. It's a pity others who have been here have not been interrogated so thoroughly. "@I am Free Let us hope so. Derek "Derek Main. If your take is the right one Derek Main. Not really. I'm saying chop off the head of the snake.
Frans Phala,"i think she is scared of the death threat this is just my theory but i think she knows something about Vrede Dairy farm killings
Confidence Selowe,y everyone is dealing with millions not thousands
Lady T,someone needs to pen down memoirs about this whole corruption of state capture and even include the scripts.I will buy the whole set of books.
