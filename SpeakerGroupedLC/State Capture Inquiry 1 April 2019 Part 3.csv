Wildthing,quarter past higher up the chain stopped them to do it at X time. who told him not to go on that day as dull as it is what's been proven here for the judge to take away was that Boasasa had connections all over and it what all the way to the top.

John Fagan,LIAR I just feel ...When you do a Raid...You do .i...I Think he is protecting some one I think I am Just irritated So who died
Nelson Musoliwa,Sound is very poor guys and is boring At a crucial moment as one would like to know how on earth someone tells the SIU of their pending search on them; state capture makoya here As tax payers we are the sponsors of this commission and u are depriving us to witness this process now it is unfair Zondo is right about privacy but are investigators not equipped with the legal authority to do as the guy did
Willem Kotze,this is not the truth as a expert the software and tools is available to anneliese the systems emedif
Born free,WHAT Happened to the element of surprise? this is strange probably already compromised. Airing on the same channel as Sponge Bob Square Pants State Capture is supposed to be finalised by May? It is more likely to be an ANC ploy to win the election and then the State will be captured once again by more corruption. Bosasa paid cash bribes Was Oellerman paid a cash bribe.. possibly Wow and yet these Investigators did nothing more afterall this corruption effected the entire country for a either 19 years!? for another 10 years these blatant criminal activities Carried on regardless of this Investigation.. very odd!
Thulani Bukani,Eish my ears bra
Richardt Human,This guy and the SIU was led by the nose all the way Bring in the SIU experts Gavin Watson and Aggrizi to clever for them. But they had inside government assistance all the time. "These guys are all so afraid to do the jobs that they get paid for @derek main absolutely EFF and BLF are both fronts for the ANC. There job is to see to what extent they can stir and then the ANC comes afterwards and either support or reject. All the focus is now on Bosasa. What happened to the Guptas?
Wallace Mandimutsira,wat now sabc sabc is captured "banking details for who now  that is correct
Frik Brits,Video shedding !! Ground control to Major Tom !!! Should we not hear what is being said now or what ?? "@SABC Digital News

Samuel J Noemdoe,April 1st
Pumlile Qengwa,The leak of info about the planned search and seizure makes them Special Information Unit. It could be that some big shot got scared names were to be mentioned
Hone—É,Is this april fool? ooooh Its working
Mncedisi Mthethwa,SABC captured now!! Where is the stream live gone to now
Christiaan Kleynhans,I have a feeling some people with power are cutting this stream. The ANC does not want us to know. We could see it over the weekend as well. They will fabricate open lies to protect themselves. Looks like SSA Bosasa is on this line. Haven't they heard of fibre yet?
welton paulse,@Pieter Torlage seems like it just ended. prematurely ended
Gift Nyathi,SABC has been scammed no picture no sound...
Derek Main,@Pieter Torlage The first step would be to get rid of the ANC. It will never end while they are in power. @The Truth Any party but the ANC. There is no other party as corrupt as them. @The Truth Look at the ANC election lists - they are not dealing with corruption. @The Truth As I've said numerous times - voting for the ANC to get rid of corruption is like americans voting for the Ku Klux Klan to get rid of racial prejudice. @The Truth Show me how I'm racist. I put it to you that you pulling the race card makes YOU the racist. "@The Truth And by the way @Robert Russell Yep - corruption at all levels - even buying votes. @The Truth I'm waiting... "@Marietjie Larney Yeah - like the ""New Dawn"" joke." @R hunter They must be ANC supporters. @Robert Russell The only reason the ANC did that is because they are all corrupt. @Danie Nilsen I thought he would have marched him to the police station long ago. Never trust what comes out of an ANC politician's mouth. @maarman Maarman So you think the DA is controlling the state capture commission? You must be an ANC supporter. @makhosi nobhatyi Yes a merry band of criminals. "@makhosi nobhatyi Where has Andile been for the last 10 years. Surely he knew of all the scandal around Bosasa. If he was ethical at all @Myka'Al Daud Yes - feed him to the lions. @makhosi nobhatyi So is it your assertion that he had no idea about all the scandal surrounding Bosasa? @Indra Reddy Because they are all corrupt. @Classic Assassin Amnesty - no $%#!@ way! @jeevan singh Believe him at your peril. @jeevan singh Can't argue with you there. @jeevan singh Trying and nervy times. First step is to get rid of the ANC. "@jeevan singh If I had the answer to that @The Truth Still waiting... "@Myka'Al Daud If you can sit hear and listen to all this evidence of corruption ad still say you're going to vote for the corrupt party "@The Truth And by the way @Myka'Al Daud There are ANC supporters in this very forum saying that. @Lorna Kavanagh The ANC don't have anyone who is not corrupt to put forward. @The Truth Have you seen the ANC election list? That's how serious they are about fighting corruption. "@The Truth As for ""we can't suspend because they have not been found guilty by a court of law"" BS. The ANC protects criminals." @The Truth I tell people who they shouldn't vote for because they should be aware of the track record. @Myka'Al Daud Yes - the ANC elective conferences sound totally corrupt. You buy your votes there. "@The Truth If me pointing out the absolute corruption of the ANC makes me a racist  @The Truth I put it to you that you are the racist. @The Truth So you seem to be saying that we should first address all the corruption every in the world before tackling the ANC corruption! Ridiculous. @Cameron Kim Ah - that old chestnut. @The Truth I rest my case. @The Truth We are only having hearings - no ANC politicians have been charged or arrested or jailed. So nothing has really happened yet. Don't get too excited. @The Truth Why not? There is enough evidence already for the police and NPA to investigate and charge people. Why hasn't it happened? Because this is just a time-wasting exercise. @The Truth Look at what happened with the Arms Deal Inquiry. A white-wash. Same could happen here. @Sinawo Qhaji Why not? @Robert Russell LOL @The Truth You don't seem to be getting my point. We have a police force and an NPA - we should have to wait for commissions of inquiry before they do their jobs. @The Truth *shouldn't "@Sinawo Qhaji I seem to recall something like ""Any evidence given here could not be used to incriminate people in court later. That rang alarm bells for me." "@The Truth Like I say - after the fiasco of an Arms Deal inquiry @The Truth The ANC have perfected corruption like no other entity. Corrupt to the core. "@The Truth In all the corruption we are hearing about here @Andrew Mboweni None more so than the ANC. @Classic Assassin Take it to the commission. "@The Truth If you were a patriot @Andrew Mboweni The Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party. "@Andrew Mboweni Quite frankly @Andrew Mboweni Maybe that's because they merged with verwoerd's party. @Andrew Mboweni I agree with you - we need something fresh. No baggage. Devolution of power to the people. @The Truth You're probably talking of the OLD ANC. When they still had principles. What we are dealing with now is an entirely different animal. Corrupt to the core. @The Truth No - you misunderstand me. The NEW ANC is corrupt to the core. It cannot self-correct. It's simply a party for hyenas. "@Matthew Adams The ANC of today is a far cry from the once principled movement. They might as well be different parties. In fact "@The Truth I say we hit them from all sides and in any way possible @The Truth So you're one of the idiots? "@The Truth You do understand
Magda Seguin,Last week the sounds were as if a short circuit is being attempted...I may be wrong but it is suspucious Are the same captured state security officials still in employ? The ANC NEC are meeting today after the news of the book on Ace was published.I am looking forward to read their statement. Agrizzi said the exact same thing What is so sad is that so many people did their work diligently and honestly and was victimised until they resigned or they were suspended for having done nothing wrong ruining their lives After all this I think those affected must sue the state in a class action "The honourable thing would be for the ANC to resign from government "Betrayal @Robert Russell that will be the first and best to do So you know he is a racist? You are being like all the EFF and BLF sheep.STOP IT!! @maarman Maarman...go play elsewhere asseblief @Daniel Nilsen...Batho Pele is also a hoke *joke The ANC 's slogan is 'People First...they are mocking the nation Zuma must the first to go to prison In the Free State they used the health budget for other things...The healthcare and hospitals in the FS is a disgrace Section 27 and TAC had many meetings in the communities and appealed to Ace to get his act together but he was busy with the Guptas instead @Select a you can catch up on Twitter or news24 @Lee Hendrix I have been saying it repeatedly @Planeless Pilot apparently it is true..yesterday BLF met and had dinner with Zuma There is also talk of The EFF amalgamating with the ANC @michael mbatha that is wishful thinking...Mazotti didn't pay millions in taxes and was protected by Moyane...do you really think he will come to testify? @Michael mbatha true anything is possible Is this the gentleman from the Free State? If it Is him you can expect fireworks about Ace @jeevan singh my sentiments too...I heard that Eskom has been told to keep the lights on until the elections..what will happen after that nobody knows What about Mantashe? @Lorna Kavanagh they are on the list already Mr le Roux from Bosasa who installed the security systems @MIKE LOCK I was so glad that race was not mentioned but here ot pops up again...some people just cant resist Yep! The firepool is the biggest problem...lol

Robert Russell,@Magda Seguin ....maybe not... but the captured politicians are still in power.... STRATCOM is on strike..... STRATCOM.....said...... LOL!!!!! @Derek Main ....ANC supporter <80..... tells it all... no hope....KFC and a T Shirt for his vote... @Magda Seguin .... that's the ANC for you.... Staying on the subject.... all the companies that lost out on tenders to BOSASA should do a class action against the ANC.... not the government... to claim back lost profits and costs... The ANC should be sued for keeping corrupt ministers in positions when they (the ANC) knew they were corrupt but yet let the stealing as a collective continue to be thieves... and they should be held accountable... the same way as Al Capone was taken down.... so should the ANC... use other means to break there comrades cabal Sue them as a party who nominated minsters who were proven to have stolen from the country in positions to allow them to have been able to keep stealing... @Norman Zwane Civil Society will have to do it.... but I firmly believe that there are grounds for a class action against the ANC @Norman Zwane for @The Truth and @Derek Main ....then I'm a racist as well Just imagine doing this detail on Nkandla... we would see Zuma in jail in 2210 "FFS @Derek Main ....don't use the word ""White""" @Marietjie Larney ....thank your ANC government Hey Zondo.... so now AGAIN the thieves and crooks are protected AGAIN.... @Thando which is sad when it is blatantly clear they are crooks... funny they nevr get to court...FYI... @Thando Nkutha

They are playing dirty now. and they are going to loose this cases "ladies and gentlemen
