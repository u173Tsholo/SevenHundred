Thanda Sibisi,SABC are you watching?😂🤣🤣🤣🤣Sabotage by WMC I presume?🙈🙈 @ James Moselenyana: Before they engage “Religious capture” including “Christian Capture “ by unscrupulous Pastors/“Prophets” I think legislation should be passed on who clecting religious donations. @Vincent Hoburn.Today whites over 60 who voted Apartheid into power are “scarce as hen’s teeth”. 30 years hence those who voted ANC into power will be “scarce as hen’s teeth”. Amen! @Gerard Victor. The same applies to many blacks who were denied opportunities under Apartheid only to be successful in Britain USA etc. @Albert van Qickelberger. 500 billion can only build 1 million homes at R500 000 per home . Probably more homes than that in Sa

Pastor J.J,@Antoinette Van Niekerk You have seriously confused me in just a few minutes.What are you talking about? Vote for ALI BABA. He only has 40 thieves. The ANC and EFF have almost a thousand and still counting. @Teunis van Ree Greetings and Blessings Bro Invitation to the CORRUPTION OLYMPICS-16 to 20 November 2020. @SanFran Arnold I was equally confused by that statement 30%. Short and sweet 30% is the rule. 20% the exception for some. Others just fail and give up. We have some here today. "Seems we have a ""Goat Plague""on the chat today." Clearly we have more than one on this chat that missed the 20% cut. Seems like we are at the petting zoo today. so many goats and those who missed the 20% pass mark. sad reality @Valencia J That was an F. This is so much worse @Paul Buchel We seem to have a few here that are well below the mark. We are considering 7 or 8 now for our farm animals @Paul Buchel and I was being generous. @Naledi Barron Just got back @R E I got it. How are you my Darling friend @Louis C And I heard that the fees remain unpaid. @Louis C Greetings Bro. I am fearful of believing much from that Ace fella @Louis C I know my friend

Bonolo Easy Masomeng,Can those camera man give us a proper visuals or should we stop paying tv license?
Cruda Bex,GM all
Kieron Sinewave,sounds out of sync .. and that zoom 😆 we've gone back to 1999 SABC and the witness is not giving a proper view of the truth i just wanna see orange overalls instead of red 😕 sound is panned left and out of sync ..
Bongiswa Kopeshe,@SABC News the cameraman is not giving us a proper view of the witness.
Ntuthuko Nene,Vote out the ANC thieves and liars. They own the ANC not the country. How many more SOE's must collapse? How many more bail outs can the taxpayers afford? I respect everyone's political opinion but I think Mashaba is the right man for the job. I strongly believe we would be faced with international sanctions if EFF took over. "Mzala they have a full list of their core values on the ActionSA website. Mashaba has a proven record as the mayor of Jozi. He is for the people  "The ANC is completely unable to self correct. They protected Zuma for years saying he's done no wrong Malema discharged a rifle in public and then later lied and said it was a toy. Floyd assaulted a journalist. Thats the leadership you want in the Union Buildings? I am voting Action SA "Just because Jews ended up getting a state of their own Israel.  That's not fair Gerard I guess Gerard we as citizens could have signed a petition to have that pass rate decision reversed. "I agree this corruption is unprecedented. No economy can prosper and grow with this kind of corruption. How can anyone be blind to this? SABC "As much as I hate to say To think we used to build the Rooivalk. A respected attack helicopter around the world. Wonder if we can still do it with all this corruption. People we can agree to disagree respectfully and peacefully. This is what a democracy is. Zuma is the worst president in the history of Democratic SA. King Shaka International airport(Top 5 in Africa) was about R5Billion to build. Imagine how much more we could have built with all the bailouts going to SOEs because of corruption. Malema would be this country last nail on the coffin. Zimbabwe 2.0 Awu Kubheka!!! lol. I would like it if the opposition controlled one of the investigating and prosecuting units of the state just to keep the incumbent on their toes. "Zuma messed up the SIU They werent under Zuma though Mzala. Yeah thats true Mzala. lol niyayingcwaba...lol . ANC is beyond repair I think. "EFF will result in sanctions. As soon as the US sanctions us Kunjalo And the gang lives on unless we vote them out That's the biggest scape goat for the ANC. "Some people will support ANC not matter how badly it governs. ANC first  lol "They wont do that Phakamile. They shielded Zuma for years for their interests Denel was such a promising SOE Who is going to service our Rooivalk? Cheers Elton

Val Speirs,Politicians are crooks No competency among the senior executives or ministers just BEE. Ramaphosa made this commission possible and soon we will see Julius in the Hot Seat 🔥 I vote for transparent governance not based on race. Julius the fool Economic Freedom Fools will never rule South Africa. I dont need healing just hate the EFF just thugs EFF straight to jail in their orange overalls 😁 There was a reason Julius and Hacob fallout because Jacob did not make Julius a beneficiary of his corruption Zuma never understood what a Commission into State Capture really entailed because Prosecuters and some members of NPA had been captured by him. "Yes @ Nic This corruption is far worse than any previous government or any country. It is a blatant illegal entitlement to black empowerment. GREED Self empowerment by corruption. STEENHUISEN is great. "You must pay for the land as your Tribal leaders would make you contribute Your ancestors fought tribal wars. Tribal land very much exists today. The government owns so much land so there is no need to steal it from the farmers that feed this nation. Cannot reclaim land which is bonded with Banks. Zuma's tenure as President was and is an absolute disgrace. Just imagine how far ahead this country could have been if it weren't for corruption. Yes and there votes will increase.

Anwar Syed,@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee - the Red Brigade are thieves themselves. You can see what's happened with VBS. Malema is thief himself @Thukoko Nene - your are 100% correct. @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee - the only thing the EFF has done is to bring Zuma down. So why have they stopped marching against corruption of Ace Magashule etc? The supporters if EFF are brain dead and educated. What has stopped EFF marching against Magashule & co. @Gerard Victor - Correct!. the uneducated masses get bluffed with party T-shirts. The DA Should be dumped as a Political party because they support Apartheid Israel.

Mzalwane Mzala,@Ntuthuko Nene Does Mashaba take corruption seriously? Thank you @Val Speirs @Ntuthuko Nene Mashaba says in his party there will be no leadership elections as he will choose the leaders except the president and provincial chairs. Is that democratic? The FF+ will rule South Africa @Val Speirs The EFF is the third biggest party in this country. What about the townships @TheC4RB1N3 ? Are you saying the goodness of the DA ends in the suburbs @TheC4RB1N3 and you are justifying that? @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee When they say Cape Town is well run they ignore Khayelitsha. I am not going to blame the ANC for what is happening in a province and a municipality that is run by the DA. Are you agreeing that there is no difference in townships that are run by the ANC and those that are under the DA and you still insist that the DA is better? @Phakamile Khuzwayo Your party must not be in government it does not want to deal with governance challenges. @Anwar Syed You are right and @elton van neel is not being truthful as there are parties that are sensitive to the Palestinian plight. @Phakamile Khuzwayo loosing your vote will not make much difference to the ANC Are you arguing against having a government @elton van neel ? @Mike Clark I stay in a province that is run by the DA and I do not experience that DA goodness because I am in the township. @Phakamile Khuzwayo Please educate yourself about the South African education system as you clearly do not know it. All the schools in the Western Cape are under a DA MEC. There is no choice. @Val Speirs The FF+ is the future Are you now tired of spewing political bile @Phakamile Khuzwayo and you say no more politics? Why are so many black leaders leaving the DA @Nic Charlez ? @Simphiwe Kubheka Now we agree The FF+ shocked the DA in the last elections. You must be happy @Val Speirs @Phakamile Khuzwayo Are you saying all suburbs are under DA? @Phakamile Khuzwayo Suburbs in Johannesburg are under an ANC municipality. "@Phakamile Khuzwayo Johannesburg has got one municipality Suburbs and townships fall under a municipality @Phakamile Khuzwayo @Manelisi mnguni Our electoral system accommodates even the smallest of parties. @Ntuthuko Nene Law enforcement and prosecuting institutions have to be independent. @Ntuthuko Nene That is not a reason to call for further curtailment of their independence. @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee Hahaha @Phakamile Khuzwayo What are ama votes ka SASSA? @Ntuthuko Nene Kunjalo @Phakamile Khuzwayo Why do you wanna build an organisation that you've left? Students of history will tell you of many times when it was said the ANC was dead. Do you not vote @Shabba Shabalala? @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee You said fire and read now he says even the EFF is useless but he pretends as if he is politically neutral. I have no enemy that is called EFF. Boycott as a tactic only works when you have enough weight to stop a process @Shabba Shabalala. For now you only count as one of the many people who choose not to vote and political life moves on. By-elections will be held in 95 wards countrywide on 11 November 2020 Why were the EFF and FF+ the only parties that recorded significant growth in the 2019 elections? Angelo Agrizzi remains gravely ill in hospital as lawyer seeks release on bail (Timeslive) No continuity? "Daniel Mantsha @Naledi Barron When the term of one board ends it is preferable that you have at least one person with institutional memory continuing with the new board. I hope he comes @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA It's a shame @Naledi Barron @mervin harrison Do you include Malema in that number as he is accused of bankrupting Limpopo province when he was ANCyl chair? @Bongiwe Moeli 😃😃 Yep Now that Mahumapelo has been mentioned Mayor Masina will want to mobilize black people against the commission.
