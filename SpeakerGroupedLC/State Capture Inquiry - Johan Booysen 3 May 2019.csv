Sebation Nantsika,Sound is bad Thanx SABC @seguin that will make sense to Maimane Can someone tel me what are we owing this guptas that makes them to take advantage of everything that we own. I think we need to fix our national security we not safe in this country
Born free,"Julius Malema got that no brainer Zuma elected in 2008. Malema is a partner of State Capture especially in Limpopo. Malema is being investigated for tender corruption Have you ever wondered how Malema made his millions.. just google it. I am poor no millions not even my ancestors made money but they worked hard to out food on the table. I hope to win the lotto Malena is a partner in State Capture "When Malema was expelled from the ANC in 2012 because he is an embarrassment to them The Black race. Sorry but true Malema also hashed up false stories in order to get Pravin Gordhan axed. Malena is worse than Zuma. Apologies But I did not ask the question about race. Not so Felix Exactly. They could not corrupt Booysen because he is not that kind of of man. Is Joshua Doore still around?? A person is either corrupt or not. Booysen is NOT. "Hopefully the cases of corruption against Zuma Africa They though they were above the law haha I think their world of greed and corruption is crashing down on them as we speak. Yes Nelson that is Malemas agenda with the poor and unemployed. "Why do you think Malema said ""I will kill to put Zuma in power""?because Zuma is not an intelligent man and was corruptable and of course Malema had an Agenda." Hi Nelson the poor people are not going to listen to my warnings but they may listen to yours. Malemas agenda is not only to capture all government entities but to capture private business entities and loot the lot. OK Nelson I will try my best. Can you help please? They were scared . I can understand why they were scared to come forward while Zuma was President. Precisely Service delivery must get to the people but this has not happened because of corruption. The municipalities are just as corrupt. They must be suspended by the close of this testimony. I hope the President is sincere. The Guptas are Zuma comrades. A Gupta helped Zumas son many years ago so when Zuma came into power.. thanks to Julius.. Zuma allowed his anti-apartheid comrades to capture the state. Yes National Security needs attention. It is freedom of Speech day ðŸ¤£ I don't like the Union Jack. British are turncoats. need a magnified glass Ramophosa still has to answer for his involvement in ousting Mbeki. must remove the union jack I find it hard to believe that Ramophosa did not know that State Capture was going on at least since 2009. OK you have my vote. Are you registered? The white gentleman who designed the new flag did not know how much shame it has caused. ðŸ˜ª DA is my only and ultimate choice. British were and are turncoats the flag will be better without the Union Jack. Not only taxpayers money but pension fund money. Booysen is the only honourable man testifying. Yes and they suspend all these government crooks with full pay for years because they have no money in their pension funds to pay them out with. Then they steal from other coffers to do so. The Guptas captured Zuma son. I stand by the DA let's say the ANC has policies it has never delivered.. false promises. Yes the movement.. inbox me. who is racist?? I forgive him it is freedom of speech day What duties does a deputy President have? Same bus different driver Booysen did but those cases were dismissed by the corrupt advocates. They tried to capture Booysen If they could not capture you they got rid of you. How mafiosa. To capture Booysen for lunch Yes Currying favour
Felix Muyoba,@Val Speirs how did your forefathers made their millions which you and your generations will inherit? @Val Speirs you seem to have a problem with the CIC..why? @Karen Hewson and @Michael Wild ask @Val Speirs "just to emabarass you @Fils de l'homme no man..for me if you are a principled person i dont care whether black or white i will support you.. the general is a principled man i can sense..so i support him but the transvaal story.. @future medics 100% corrrect!
Nelson Musoliwa,Which race is synonymous with economic mismanagement? Which continent is synonymous with economic mismanagement which inevitably results in under development? Work a man on his mind(indoctrination) then you will control him for a long time than enticing him with material things which may be lacking at times. Agree with you Val it is not coincidence let the poor be warned against this type of leaders Power next to the state coffers(money) is not as healthy as we would like it to be. Is this without regard to race? Val you cant loose before you fight but your point is understood . You have a role to play in awakening the poor on this matter Of course Val OUr national security was at a very high rist Where there is no adherence to rule of law results are chaos and calamity as pointed out from this Booysen tetimony State capture nearly destroyed T Madonsela's career if not life
Karen Hewson,why does this have to be about race? a cheat is a cheat is a cheat regardless of the colour of the skin.
Wildthing,why make it a why ask dumb questions like that. individuals make the choice to do wrong. and they come from all walks of life. so much money wasted to protect the corrupt people from PTA and JHB to Dur vert true. he also ordered the killing of ANC members that started an uprising in Mozambique. what a great leader. ha ha off to the shebeen curry time mango juice
Magda Seguin,No sound at all!!! "No it's not Thank you SABC! To Durban Yes Judge...subpoenas "Remember Zuma was intelligence head in exile Political killings in SA is not widely reported and it goes on unabated It is easy to understand why Malema said he will kill for Zuma Zuma had so much more that he exonerated Jiba's husband and employed her a DD of the NPA knowing full well she was never admitted to the Bar as an attorney I can full well understand that CR was not included in the Zuma faction while he was deputy president...everything happened underground @makhosi nobhatyi true And flying down on New Years day!! It's the same as the fake pastors @makhosi nobhatyi they enslave people psychologically ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ The Guptas was first introduced to Zuma by Essop Pahad in India that's where it all started "South Africa should never have joined BRICS *oppressive Advice:Keep a diary...I do and save them for all my life While the security services was working for Zuma other countries may have all SA secret info...they created a gap for others to spy on SA "Thank you @Michael Holmes What people font understand us that the DA get their share of money from treasury like all the other provinces but dont steal or mismanage it South Africans didnt want to believe that Zuma comsorted with gangsters Duduzanes wanted documents Gen Booysen told him he has to subpoena the docs True @Thapelo Motabogi..everybody made her a laughing stock "Problem with Mrs Mentor is that she spoke from memory Gen Booysen obviously didn't know the Zuma/Zuma connection...All the people who met the Guptas was through Duduzanes who brings in the Guptas by surprise It was a deliberate pattern to implicate key people He did daddy's dirty work by being likable On arrival yes...same thi g happened to others...I listebed to this commission testimonies from the beginning @future medics The Zuma/Gupta strategy had a clear pattern I urge everyone to read Hen Booysens book called Blood on their hands
Anne M.,@Magda Seguin Sound is fine this side. Maybe reload your streaming? "@Thando Nkutha Your advice is too late for Jiba @Louis Opperman True. @Granny Mokwena And they did - for quite a few years. "@psyfrequency Techno Why on earth would you put this flag as your profile pic @psyfrequency Techno Telling me to grow up does not answer my question. @Danie Nilsen I agree with you - any hate speech is unacceptable. @SABC Digital News What's happening? Tea time ended at least 10 minutes ago.
