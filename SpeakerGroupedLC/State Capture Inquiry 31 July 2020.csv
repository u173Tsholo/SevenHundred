Pastor J.J,"​May you all and your Precious Families have a safe @rohan...they trying to load the R10 Data Voucher.1 Digit missing @funicanz....we still faithful and signed on to both channels @Villager Man...You say that as a fact? Why is it at the Commission then? @Village Man....The first report was considered a draft and needed to be amended with new fact before it became a final report @Villager Man....Thats is not factual according to the evidence though @Sal...works at Werksmans @Elvis....I am running 2 pages. still faithful to the end @Hadley....If they fall they will just bend and pick it up like they try with the Rand/Dollar I suspect mr July is attempting to justify his fees I need a PA here...Anyone free @Jacqui....You are too sharp today Sister...i Like @Carl...On an assignment...doing a citizens arrest as per instructions @Bianca.....No I have one already. She was on an assignment she is back now....I am heppy heppy "@Bianca...But @Bianca...True....Failure is blamed on everything else but the actual acts that resulted in failures. "@Carl..@Bianca....Like I dont have a job or money and I blame something else...Not @bongile....very very true....the govt is too busy with perfecting corruption to be stressed about us..And a 100 years later we are still focused on colonialism.what a neat excuse for our own failures @Elvis......Call it a subtle sabotage Elvis true true bro @Rohan....I am Praying for your sanity bro...I will send you and updated Report soon @Rohan...Sorry Son...If we take you back to 2014 you will not allowed to be on the chat....Only 18 and above is allowed with PG I suspect the Goat is back in some other form...watch this space
Dominic Przybylski,This commission is still looking for a leak after the boat has sunk. Cannot look for anything after drowning. People are now dying of starvation. "Zondo has still not produced/publish anything to help Yes @Karen x I do read the news. Today I've been reading about how funds meant for saving us from the pandemic are being lost to runaway corruption. I'm reading how even more billions are going to SAA Surely Zondo has seen enough to produce an interim report providing some guidance on what has caused this corruption and what may be of assistance to prevent even more of it. "That's our most urgent problem. Everyone now knows our country is riddled corruption but everyone says it is ""not possible"" to do anything about it."
Sal SA,Maj Gen Nonopi postponed - Covid? Dominic there was a legal issue preventing legal action until commission finalized. Legislation passed this week to clear this Easy Karen Dominic this was raised previously and DCJ said it was not possible People are still to give own versions and cross examine Dominic I have great respect for DCJ This guy is on an agenda Who is July? missed the start due to transmission So he was employed by Nathi Nhleko to investigate IPId reports Surely the final report is the overriding report Its confusing that's why they mess up the job. Even the DCJ is battling to understand this hogwash Investigation and report are inextricably linked - you cannot separate them Lots of hearsay January report was not signed off by Director so it cannot be final DCJ make your rulingas u put it - January report was not final But Nhleko said final report had information removed They prolonging the issue with technicalities. Surely the properly signed off report by the Director is the final report. 2 hours to classify a report as interim or final Big difference between laid down procedure and practice Leon it's acceptable if that person is the superior and will sign off Sunday Times also implicated instate capture eg SARS rogue unit. Cannot rely on their reporting g This guy is a conspiracy theorist Lots of hearsay July withdraws his statements yes DCJ get to the crux
Karen x,Dominic Przybylski​ FFS DO YOU NOT READ THE NEWS?????
Sifiso Kheswa,Why administer the oath when everyone claims that everyone else is lying.
Ben Fraser,They should be saving for a second state of enquiry. "Starting this morning
Conproc zambia limited,@rohan barnard i lost 15minutes this man is charged ..Zondo get ready Camon Zondo..interim has the same meaning everywhere..even here in Zambia @Sal SA..NEED WE SAY MORE. DCJ and attoney sizing each other now. Zondo you now interiming everything...😂😂😂 @Akhonamandla Gala the interim break as he will say before the final break Zondo the man on the witness is gona teach you..him cant be challenged.....he seemed very ready
rohan barnard,Hhahahaha!!! Rain has lost signal again 😛 for the 1st time sabc is doing something right 😀 Morning @Jacqui Baumgardt This man is fired up! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 This is the most action we had all week! 😀 @Elvis Malakoane they need data donations @Elvis Malakoane eish ja! again with the files being disorganized 😢 and the table doesn't know whats happening @funicanz i have no idea what your talking about 😅 @Pastor J I am available as PA @Carl Botha handing out PK's to ENCA @MOSA MASENGANE and where Nhleko made examples of the whole day for 3 days without actually saying anything any mods on here? i have a grievance i report for tea time my draft report says that the interim report is not the final report but an edited reoprt on the report of reporting @Bianca A woohoo!! Which report? Your Gr3 report that you went to class with a certain former president? 👀 "so which one is now a final report? the draft @Welcome Kamogelo 🤣 it is my final report that the interim draft report of the 22nd of January is the final interim report and should be accepted as the final draft report for the interim "so in layman's terms investigative* i am so lost in this reporting that it feels like im reading a news24 report I will understand it better when ET phones home 👽 @Pastor J yes please. Reports are zooming in my ears. A PK of reports "here we go again to the 22nd of January 2014. Are these people time travelers? If so the report says nothing! Can it speak then? @Pastor J luckily back in 2014 I was 24 😛 July sounds like he is telling a whole movie with those emotions I'm failing to know how Adv. Obama can follow July. I can't understand what he is saying. Maybe it is my ADHD messing around
funicanz,"@rohan barnard  "@Anne M.  he may /might have changed the report. the question that I think he is emphasis the difference between the two. "@elvis Chair is very attentive. "@rohan barnard  "@rohan barnard 
Anne M.,Hi @funicanz @MOSA MASENGANE The report issued by Werksmans Attorneys around the rendition matter @Jacqui Baumgardt And wasn't he a poor witness? Yay! @Bianca A Morning @wim louw @Sal SA That's what I thought "You know whose name I haven't seen in a long time
Siphiwo from villages,Robert McBride is a thug "He protected his pal is it a fact that he squashed the initial report! "@Pastor J . He changed the report completely to protect his own friend "@Pastor J  Robert McBride was protected by the cabal. he is a thug who should be jailed. @DMF. ok
Inspiration Afri,how is robert mcbride a thug? how? how did he squash it? check
Joshua Borias,""" I KNOW DE WITNESS
Quest,this guy is actually making sense Now he's just rambling
Esha J,Arrogance 😬
Leon Mbangwa,Oh this is bad for the Director of Foreign Intelligence. Sorry for those that have been protecting him blindly. An investigation report cant even be changed by anyone who didn't carry out the investigations. Its only the prosecutor who will refuse to prosecute or ask for more information about the report. Why is the issue of 22 January as a final report so difficult to understand even if explained in simplest forms Deletion of some of the report contents is done or supervised by someone who was not even employed during the whole investigation. @rohan 2020 is overated indeed:goodvibes::goodvibes: Sandile July is very explicitly. You may offcourse choose to misunderstand him for your personal or commercial reasons The deletion of the information on the report of 18 March 2018 is the problem and not the number of reports. There is what is called Retalin...for those who have difficulty in understanding Mr July What happened to Madilonga? Is this the guy who died mysteriously attending a course in Paarl Capetown The report was changed and he died....so sorry for his family He died soon after the issues of two reports became hot. Perpetrators do not only give us lies but they get promoted to very sen positions in government. "I am proud of Dramat. He resigned and if it wasn't for those crooks who decided to sanitize their lies through the Commission
Jacqui Baumgardt,Morning all eish - these challenges to the commission - @Lee D. Hendrix - agree - more like cowboys and crooks though @Pastor J - today is 31 July - payday for Mr July @rohan barnard - you pipped me to the post @MOSA MASENGANE - it's about the reports submitted to Nhleko that he bumbled on about for three days Zondo already knows Nhleko was lying through his teeth
Abel Matshidiso,why is this July guy so emotional mmmhrrrr mmmmmhhrr they are just playing with words about why they ignored the report from the IPId I doubt if they gonna finish in 2 hours time like the chair suggested
Elvis Malakoane,pastorj so enca is off today Rohan Barnard they must do it fast cos they are disturbing us Now we are squatting here I hope Nhleko is watching conprocZambia looks like interim in terms of IPID act has different implications on its operational phase "pastorj I see you guys are having a heated exchange this morning pastorj Don't stress I am back I will distribute PK left and right "pastorj remember proverbs 14:7-11:escape quickly from a company of fools welcome kamogelo 😃😃🤣 Rohan Barnard 😀🤣🤣 "2020 was never a year
Lee D. Hendrix,@Jacqui Baumgardt there are too many kings and countries involved here. ....Corrupt politicians are afforded esoteric advantages and the public is never aware of the decisions. "...Yes "@Bianca A ..agreed "...Who modified or had superior input to modify each of the reports concludes in about 2 more months or so ...@Bianca A ........ It kind of seems that new colonies are being established more so.... "...HUMMM! "@Bianca A "...No proverbs could exist without ENOCH'S (son of Jared) presentation of God's command to eternity "@Bianca A  "@Bianca A  "Bianca A  ...Zondo is seeking the authoritative figure in the report sequence. "...The invisible person signed the final report ...Each report was signed by someone in particular out of the blue.. ...July wish to dictate a society to their liking. ...Perjury is the result for following others instructions. "...At this point  "...Defeating the ends of Justice is the loss of a true identity for Justice
Sean Collett,There is no such thing as a person actualy doing a job in government... "The fact is that these people are idiots. That could never pass an on the spot comprehension test Ask an idiot to fix something and they will make it worse... These people have to be payed to have this conversation? For real? They are literaly telling each other how to do there job... "Question: Why is there evedince in your devision of corruption? Eh the report Everybody report for duty! "They have not managed to settle on a single point I mean they have not been able to fulfill the basics of a constructive argument or debate... This is insane... This was ment to be a big thing to give people hope and inspire citizens to believe that action is being taken. Anyone in chat feeling inspired or hopefull? "@Vuyisani Sikobi That is a myth made up by South Africans. Beleiveing that anything to do with government is slow and hard to make happen "Compare this process to anythig BEEE "@mbombo mp A genuine funny! Priceless "The only thing unique about South African colonisation
Bonginkosi Sikhakhane,All these ewxcuses are the design of State Capture instigators to collapse the commission! Mark my words!
MOSA MASENGANE,why do they sound like they missed the lecture on those reports can someone explain what todays meeting is about ? ohh thanks guys

Madodana Tuntulwana,"Maybe lets wait and hear Mr July "This is realy getting interesting Critical investigative info deleted. recommmendations drastically changed = ? "After 22 no additional info The aim is to nullify 22 report so as to legitmise the changed report. Anyone who can advise us what informed the deletio of evidence and change of recommendation. Leon it is so disgusting when you listen pros an legal minds not mking logic in this platform. "Leon from the noise above "Let me help "Anyone please assist us It smells a rat when the same guy who changed his statement misteriously. "Melvict it would make sense Really in this time of our democracy we can never allow the breach of so many laws and the perpetrators feed us lies and get away. Our Parliament ignore Costitutional judgements and orders Leon some of us will never be fooled. The temparing with evidence has never been tested in any Court of law
Carl Botha,@Pastor J right behind you @Pastor J where is Bianca 🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣 Would think so @Sal SA @Abel Matshidiso agree @Bianca A True @Pastor J 👌 "How does our friend Goat do it to appear under so many nicknames in this chat. He must be a IT specialist. @Pastor J light that fire "What i clearly understand is that Justice system in SA flawed if your ignorance and denial can be used as defence or as in Nomvula's case dead people

Hendrix also on us and Singapore I don’t think we are them at all. Look at the looting. "@Lee D. Hendrix they were colonized and yet they did not sit back and complain.

Melvict Melbourne,who is this guy? who is this guy? Why don't they give the judge al the statements then he can see for himself? why is he folding his arms so often? dead What I find interesting is that Werksmans is involved within all the corruption cases. This guy is making his own stry u @Leon Mbangwa He was tortured anyone that think McBride is honest lives in LalaLand "yes Why don't they get the stuff and look fr themsleves? Sandile from Werksmans Is Werksmans in on this? were they trying to take this a specific direction?
Wilson M,Co ask. who is he? Hai I just came in and this guy seems to not be saying anything what?!
Cerebis,"Not saying this guy is Parliament should be asking why 58 South African are murdered each day on their watch. The fire pool minister should have given witness for half a day. He ended up telling fairy tales for 3 plus days! It is no wonder that this commission has cost in excess of R 750 million. This evidence leader has so far not done a great job. He seems to be a bit disorganized? He wasted a lot of time because his filing work was a mess. He needs to up his game. Now the DCJ is getting to the crux of the matter.
