Now the colour of the car .... Lifestyle audit will never materialize So pathetic that one shudders to think that a whole day is spent in this way This advocate is tiring to watch... Bosasa wasted their money because there is no knowledge of their involvement. The leaders of democratic SA were consumed by greed. High salaries not withstanding. They even kill to get to the trough and onto the gravy-train. And then the lies start to gather speed "If they are caught Corruption will be rewarded and perpetrators will be shielded from jailtime They are to precious to be lost to the ANC Their skills are irreplaceable. Sickening and tragic !!!! """I have never received cash"" Lies She shou She should not be surprised if all these denials do not fool anybody She never benefited ...NEVER Convenient amnesia ....
