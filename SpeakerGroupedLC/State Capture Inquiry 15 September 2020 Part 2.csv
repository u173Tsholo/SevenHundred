Yes Yes Yes...Mr Chairman...I am equally shocked...just like She played them on...by going with them and entertaining their discussions...she led them on and therefore was an accomplice I think Miss Daniels was enjoying the attention she was getting from the big guns and played them on... Politicaj interference....here it comes...be ready!!

Albert Noah,But the Chairman is trying to extracting information... "He said @Thulani Faku . In most meetings Duduzane does not speak @ Cain Chunda . It depends on the questioning of each sitting @Thulani Faku . Of courser No recording at all @Zola Pinda . The board members complement each other depending on area of specilization @Zola Pinda. Maybe publicity and marketing @Johan Maartens . It is true R600M @Mondli Nohashe. There was a lady Molefe who was CFO Eskom’s financial director Tsholofelo Molefe Today was a bad day at the office for DCJ.
Fred Desrosiers,the DCJ was not born yesterday. He sense what was going on. "money Why would she state this to these people? Why did she go? He did own the country. He owned the Presidency. yep. late night SA needs to restart with a new party with people of integrity. Stop with supporting a particular party. please support honest people no matter the party ohhhhhhh!!! snap "Sing Bird nope. she will not crumble. she has notes. other witnesses could hardly remember their name "she did not say ""I do not recall""" sorru she has been the witnesses that had the most notes. Of course her version is different then what other recalled. Koko was also capture. remember he alledgedly having sexcapades at Eskom Best witness in my view. since 7 days of lies. she dropped names like candy. now more people are implicated "places includes Mall
Eliot Chauke,CR17 donor got R1.5bn Eskom Deal R800mil. and said no? ths lady must stop lying... we know Jonas lied about R600mil @johan im for the truth racists are afraid of EFF Private Sector is corrupt. they are collapsing SAA and Eskom with Evergreen Contracts

Mbuyiseli Mtshitshi,800million 😳😳😳😳 Now I understand why Magashule and the Zuma's wanted Nkosazana to win..So that Gupta legacy can continue..Also why Bosasa funded CR17 so that they can push WMC This woman wants to tell nothing but the truth but fears that at some point she's implicated interms of bribery or decision making
Pamela February,"Yes yes 800k is more realistic! "Yes "Her safest defence is to say EVERYTHING. Then she will no longer be a threat. If she doesn't then she is at risk @Godfrey Maumela Except to feed the poor!

Cerebis,Behind the green doors WHAT???? "This is really shocking if all is true! Just remember guys @FieliesSA Or the one shower head Braai and vetkoek please. Cian did kill his brother Abel It was not a Board. It was a collection of corruption enablers. Why is Malema's wife always wearing a wig? I thought it will be today
joyce tendai Zvavareyi,How many people will need security or protection after all this. this is scary she is credible I think she needs help she is not covering. she is one person that the country should be proud of. watch you see she needs protection R800M R800m if they allow her she will help them no more you don't call the police at this point. the state needs her. she has helped a lot to expose the capture so far she is not accepted the bribe. a strong woman. Gigaba And Brian Molefe she has said thought she said he was at the Guptas which one is the zuma? same like Zanu pf in Zim business name one of the Guptas simple shame this lady need help. my heart goes out to her. Single parent. please let's bear with her. Zuma traded the country. for several billion of Rand. too late yes and too deep too. she was trapped in BTW hard surface and hard rock. she needs help. she is helping the nation. Most of her statements are straightforward. She recalls a lot of inform. ah some just said Zuma must be forgiven. Hahaha. Do you know how much Zuma denied ever meeting the Guptas? her race colour and nationality do not matter. its not really cool. Samuel Bongiwe Leslie Salute I have so much respect for her now. remember she could be your wife sister mother aunt or nana or whatever relationship that could have existed. She can try and go and rest shortly and may need very serious protection. thank you sis sadly it's got to be a safe house surely. who is blatantly lying? Big fish any one bigger than the Guptas? Guptas are bigger than Zuma for your infor and if you follow properly you have no leg to stand on it appears she never received any kickbacks Makhaye you are now insinuating things. you can join the dots easily. she was scared initially but was bold enough at the end. she is typical of a whistle-blower she knows what she is saying there is no cross examination this is a commission of enquiry! bye Best witness true. Bless.
Mohamed Mia,Hindi 🤣🤣 She is going to need protection after today She was probably paid to attend
eric laka,I am taking this lady for lunch watch the space. she sounds loose. tears
Thabo Mokoaleli,There Guptas were de facto President's of South Africa 🙈😂🤷 "Suzanne is coming nice
Hub Grasstruths,so the cellphone towers will show she was there but her testimony is that she sat outside the meeting. These expensive lawyers are worth every cent in their weight a few years later she will start a #metoo movement they told her swallow these pills she was shocked and swallowed almost choked then she was shocked by the trip and can't remember she was blowing all her life already now she changed the tool to a whistle I always wonder why these people got so many calls from Essa and the Guptas They NEVER call me "I am a unicorn of highest integrity who made it into the ANC political elite and here "I'm a parasite because I'm a single parent and female - o

Hlagala Masetlale,why does this lady always going along? besides the bribes what else did she enjoyed? @Val Spiers you must remember that corruption was available during apartheid era but it was not exposed because it benefited you the minority.
Pheladi Lamola,"If Salim Essa was into human trafficking this lady would've been history. How do you just agree to go with people ""you don't really know "" anywhere they say?" Don't get lost @Delanie Joseph. She's explaining why she thinks the board was not bona fide Maybe it was that Klein woman She was one of them chair. Wow Maybe she thought this time they would offer her a billion rand. Zuma really should be charged with treason. He gave the Guptas powers they never should have had The chair's memory is admirable. I believe Suzanne is mostly telling the truth. The problem is she was enticed into an almost entanglement and that compromised her integrity. They use secondment as an excuse to bring their lackeys to loot It's the strangest thing. This board was a law unto themselves. Did Ms Klein say anything about the destroyed report? I may have missed it. Well the DCJ basically told her not to insult his intelligence and from then on she had to get it right.

"Judge ZONDO will be able to manage all state owned entities when this commission of enquiry ends The EFF are very much a part of the economic crisis in South Africa. I wouldn't say corruption is slow moving at all considering all the SOE's that have collapsed due to corruption. Corruption spreads as fast as cancer does. South Africa had a strong currency in Apartheid years the currency today is worth a peanut. Then the majority have certainly crashed the currency @ Ameer..do you play the stock market or Bitcoin? They are all a law unto themselves they have no regard for mandatory regulations or due process. Malema in court and hopefully Jail soon. She has used Tresemme to straighten her hair .😁
