Granny Mokwena,my other favorite advocate.💃 not today please it's too early guyz trolls should be ignored completely! They eventually disappear into thin air.. the whole of them looted SA truth is if most of us had the means to start over anywhere we would the ANC has no will power to even try stamp out corruption!
Magda Seguin,Another day of looting exposure Eastern Cape Premier elect in new scandal.A new Bentley costing R4m and house renovations in question "Not really @Robert Russell I may be mistaken but didn't the Guptas have majority shares in China South Rail? The billions paid to CSR was never paid back as they never provided anything "@Rubin Naidoo I know the feeling Thanks @Robert Russell my head is spinning with all the details..its becoming hard to keep up Oh Yes@Robert Russell I remember the shelf company now @Granny Mokwena there was a time I cried every day listening to this commission..its soul destroying especially knowing the majority of SA people are struggling and poor "Yes I was confused @Robert Russell If they made a gesture to have a small ceremony it would have showed compassion and integrity R140m just for one day.. I see on Twitter that people are not happy about the inauguration flamboyancy and spending Out if the 32 thousand invited only 10 thousand 'ordinary'South Africans are allowed as 'walk ins'...those who have no cars will not stand a chance. "@Bridgette Kekana Me too The entry for ordinary SAs are between 3am and 7 am...its laughable having to wait for hours until the others arrive "@Robert Russell I really pray that NDZ do not become Deputy President I am sick in bed today but the commission is too important to miss @makhosi nobhtayi thanks for explaining..it gives a bit of hope @Lorna Kavanagh as far as I gathered it was never delivered but the money was never returned "@Jabu Malinga you are right @Jabu Malinga 😅 But he has exceptional institutional knowledge...age is nothing "In Europe they are even recruiting ex Mayors etc. into EUCommission Boarss for their knowledge *Boards "Rob Davies of the Sri is not on the list..Patel also not *dti Money for jam..R500m like it's nothing.. and miracles??? Rob kept the dti on a tight leash even with illicit tobacco smugglers wanting to bribe his staff @Khalid Mather true But I also believe there is a concerted effort in the 21st century that spread ageism...making older people out to be fools is not intelligent at all.Sages are to be respected. Jiba and Mwerebi should have been arrested and charged for obstruction of justice "Zuma had the NPA in his pocket for 9 years hence no arrests or prosecutions..the evidence is clear Why are you shouting @Andrew Mboweni @Jabu Malinga...ask Jiba and Mwerebi...Zuma's lackeys You obviously have not listened to McBride and Gen.Booysens testimonies You guys are giving me a headache 6 months versus 10 years? are you listening to your own argument? "SA is a constitutional democracy that was looted for 10 years now you want swift justice without getting watertight cases Talk with yourself @Jabu Malinga "Race baiting again Stop shouting please "Take it up with the ruling party "Register on Polity.org and the Parliamentary Monotoring Group (PMG) get involved and give your opinion "Yes One thing I have against the EFF is that their followers treat Juju as a Saviour...he is NOT! he gets paid by taxpayers. "I was already there as an ordinary citizen @Andrew Mboweni "Thank you "The ANC wanted fracking in the Karoo "Shell had to pull out of wanting to do fracking in SA "The Karoo is a water poor area And I am sure if fracking was allowed a lot more state capture was going to happen knowing what I learnt from this commission "We should all have one focus "Thank you for the info @Khalid Mather I certainly will have a look "@Andrew Mboweni you are correct
Felix Muyoba,this looks like a british descent south african citizen i dont know what @Val Speirs is worried about my statement.. anyone can be a learned and articulate as long he/she given an opportunity.. the english in general have bad manners..the guy doesnt even address the dcj as chair as per norm.. @Val Speirs no man.. @Jabu Malinga it is because the evidence being given today is rubbish..i dont get this english guy is saying..i think even the dcj is not following well.. how can you attend the meeting without being authorised to do so? english arrogance the motives for his business cases on s.a. rail systems was to align it to british system so that he brings more english people here.. "@Khalid Mather he was recommending locomotives from australia @Robert Russell there I agree with you @Khalid Mather what paper? this friend of @Val Speirs is lost
Born free,So what if this man is of British descent?? This learned gentleman is going to explain that the purchase of the Chinese locomotives were not compatible with our train tracks/rails. I do wish that the railway system could be resurrected so that these heavy duty transporting Trucks do not have to be on the roads which would also reduce maintenance costs.Army must safeguard trains. As long as he makes eye contact with Judge Zondo it's fine one does not have to keep referring to the Chair. I think his manners are impeccable. Ramaphosa should just be sworn in.. no party celebrations in this terrible economic climate. Imagine if the money had been spent on service delivery and uplifting the poor what a difference it could have made to these communities... but that is not what happened. The Rich have heaven on earth the poor remain the same. Must go and protest where this Inauguration is taking place. Get your posters ready. Protest against the expenditure of this Inauguration. Ramophosa surely cannot elect people who have been implicated in corruption in this commission of enquiry. NDZ was captured and is linked to the Guptas. Houston we have a problem well these skeletons are out of the closet now Makings be careful and divert from your racist arrogance please. Malinga divert from your racist arrogance please. Politicians.. hmm 🤔more like Corruptioneers I don't think there are any politicians in the ANC I don't believe this man is confused but you are Arrests will be forth coming this commission is listening to the testimony of witnesses first. Agrizzi was a witness as well as his involvement in corruption . Agrizzi was not the only Bossasa member arrested. They knew the consequences prior to testifying. Then don't be on this chat site because there are plenty of critics of the ANC All these investigations were halted due to the corrupt prosecutors in the NPA and Jiba. They will be resurrected You had better stock up with candles because the lights will go out in June The locos supplied by CSR would not be identical to those to be supplied.. simple 🚂🚃 In this case they never got to see the pig haha yes
Sasha,"This man is well spoken 
Meshikiah Empire,This is going to be interesting
Robert Russell,You seem surprised.......????? @Magda Seguin Nope no share holding.... only kick backs via Issa and a Hong Kong shelf company @Magda Seguin You might have been confused with Denel and VR Laser I agree with you Magda..... about the poor people suffering even more than they deserve too... imagine what a R140 MILLION could do instead of the ANC spending this on a party for CR next week I think he should be sworn AT for allowing this waste of money @Bridgette Kekana ....Zuma's last party cost R240 MILLION.... so the ANC now thinks they are doing well.... CR has the back bone of a jelly fish..... expect to see the same crooks in the NEC selection... @Magda Seguin DD is waaay to influential to be ignored....but yes... lets hope then that the Zuma faction doesn't get that high up the leadership ladder in parly... we have ACE as SG with Jessie the lap dog as well From what I understand... the ANC NEC makes up the list of members to parly.... the President picks his Cabinet from this list..... @Jabu Malinga ...Question... What is the collective noun for a group of politicians?..... Answer...... A pack of lies 😃 😃 😃 OMF..... Rob Davies not on the list..... I think we are going to have even more challenges.... @Magda Seguin @Jabu Malinga the answer is simple.... NPA = NEVER PROSECUTE THE ANC For R54Bn could we not have built these loco's ourselves and enjoy the spin off's that this would have created by way of jobs etc?????? yeah.... @Andrew Mboweni ....for a R100 MILLION... """Flawed""..... I think he means FRAUD"
S'bo N,i doubt @Rubin Naidoo
UN- DILUTED,looters must be brought to book ... watching from europe
Norman Zwane,@Rubin Naidoo From what I hear None. All departments were infected with this looting streak. I would be suprised if I was told otherwise. Seated to the right of Ms Sello is who please? "Hayi maan  Zondo is starting to get to my nerves the way he is so hard on Ms Sello. Nesmilnyana dololo ithi ingane iyamdlalisa. Lobaba maar!
Derek Main,@Rubin Naidoo No - all levels of government have been corrupted by the ANC "@Randall Lewis Not all of us have bought into the Ramaphoria. Only when Zuma and Magashule are in jail @Lee Hendrix Or they thought they were getting a pig and got a dog instead
Khalid Mather,Mohammed Mohammedy... connection :O "@Val Speirs exact;ly  Zondo is confaazed today In some organization if you go or dont go its still an issue "You are bonkers @Felix Muyoba  "Im not supporting this old man in his confusion and forgetfulness  "You are educated did you manage to download the paper @Felix Muyoba ? @Felix Muyoba I uploaded it for you all The problem with the NDP – which from 2009-14 was managed by former Finance Minister TrevorManuel & Cyril Ramaphosa (Zuma replacement as president) – was its fetish for corporate‘extractivist’growth. "Matemela is a neoliberalist  Asiy'funi iAgenda Yama Capitalist "you think fracking is bad aunty Magda 
king James aka 50pac B.I.G makaveil,more show
Bridgette Kekana,@Val l agree with u this ppl must save money for education homelessness health Magda this money is too much Anc cant think properly @Magda n me 2 l m not happy doing nothing going to Loftus n get one thigh or drumstick n 3 slices of bread Bathabile Gigaba n Nomvula going to parly l cant believe this NDZ will save her ex husband from prosecution @Val yes it is true bfore its too late Nomvula has been implicated

Jabu Malinga,why are ppl arguing on here. lik it will mak any difference..lol. Pravin Gordan will be deduty president what wil u ppl do if honourable SG Ace becomes no.2...hahahahahah There will be no change ppl. get that out ya heads. Ramaphosa promised a lot of favors to win at Nasarec. DD and the like have to now be accommodated. "ramaphosa had all these months to make changes what makes u think he will suddenly appoint ppl who are not implicated even he is implicated in som things lik marikana. small nyara skeletons. everybody has them why are the group of ministers called a cabinet? isn't it a cabaal is this guy talking sense? he is way past hire expiry date. should have retired long ago "zikalala in premier in kzn "mahumaphelo is still pulling strings in north west. is ramaphosa could The nec supposed to have majority ramaphosa ppl in it. but it is obvious they hav to allow the other faction to also hav their ppl in their so ter is peace "when zuma was pres rama margarine cant to much. he cant only try but the zuma faction still has som power and they are aligning themselves for a takeover in 5 years. watch this space "there have been 100s of ppl implicated in this  agrissi was d guy arrested. how com? why nobody else? ramaphoria is a smokescreen. no high ranking politician or politically connected person wil go to jail "this comm will take another 2 years. cost 100s of millions lik arms deal.. a long comm for arms deal. who went to jail??? don't fool yourselves ppl. these commissions are a waste. evidence is ter. if npa wanted they could prosecute.no need for commision the money trace is ter. estina dairy scandal. has anyone gon to jail??? "plane landing at waterkloof "Jonas bride "thoshan panday and madhoo caught briding general booysen.. was panday arrested. no "all this evidence in this commission "yes "Andrew "nothing will happen.. and those wanting an argument and a fight is anyone listening to this guy..hahahaha "no facts brother telling and words don't count..actions count "rama can talk for days. ppl want action. he said his goin to bring jobs.. when
Pheladi Lamola,And they will spend more millions on the SONA after the Loftus shindig. I agree @Felix Muyoba. He shouldn't have attended the meeting if he was not delegated by anyone. @Jabu Malinga I think Agrizzi was arrested so that he wouldn't testify at that commission which was dealing with Snake and Snail.
Lorna Kavanagh,Were the 1064 locomotives ever delivered? and was the gauge correct?
makhosi nobhatyi,"@ Magda Seguin surely that won’t happen if it does will create divisions coz women failed to backup candidates for deputy president "Ramaphosa hasn’t made any promises to any individuals One else in our movement
sylivester mazigo,what Happened to Hon Stive Masele politian "What happen to Hon Stive Masele
Wildthing,Val that's 85% of the ANC he was not in but outside
James Godloza Godloza,if President Rama exclude those who are implicated in this commission then the will be no one in parliament to represent the anc coz they are all corrupt
0,then when you don't go they email you about your absence some people ag
Mzalwane Mzala,@Jabu Malinga The president does not choose premiers. The NEC choose premiers from a list of 3 people that they get from the PEC. People who are outside of the ANC want to ANC to be frozen to pre-Nasrec positions. There have been contests before and people move on. Please non-ANC people allow us to move on. People who are outside of the ANC want to freeze the ANC to pre-Nasrec positions. There have been contests before and people move on. Please non-ANC people allow us to move on. Linda Mti was arrested so it is not true that only Agrizzi was arrested Linda Mti "The arrests include Patrick Gillingham I blame people like @Jabu Malinga for what happened with the Estina case @Jabu Malinga Has stopped saying only Agrizzi has been arrested and he now acknowledges that 'just a few bosasas went to court'. Comrade @Andrew Mboweni you won't get anywhere with people who makes up their own facts like @Jabu Malinga
BONKE XAKATHA,KUBI !!!

Dilip Badal,@Andrew Mboweni ..future without electricity.. contradictory😂😁😀 @Jabu Malinga absolutely spot on
Lew464,"the ANC brought SA to it's knees. The majority of ANC supporters are rural illiterate. They are ""bought"" with free T-shirts and food the week leading up to the election." Ramaphosa is tainted. He cannot act against corrupt officials for fear of backlash.
MIKE DURBAN,Aaaaaaaa...the Race will Always be played by Some People....especially the bitter and twisted ones....hey.. @Magda Seguin ...spot on. We All need to prosper and have a better future.....All Of Us. @Derek Main .......You are 100% spot on.......only then...will i start to believe. Only then will i have faith in this Gov.
