Magda Seguin,On time Overseas furniture transfer can be done by eg Stuttafords or other removal companies Mr Agrizzi came forward on his own..he is a whistleblower "Anyone can go forward with information Agrizzi presented himself of his own accord...he was not summonsed This commission has shown that not many people has the guts to come forward with info on corruption...quite a few state employees resigned instead of revealing the rot "The Guptas are in hiding in Dubai The extradition order will still take time..it has already been signed a few months ago "Gillingham lived off taxpayers money..his entire family benefited @Bas Mdake that's nonsense...The PP report called for a commission.Tge EFF is feeding untruths to their followers @Yin Yang thank you!!.. I am tired of EFF electioneering on all social media platforms The best will be if no party gets majority and a coalition will be forced to govern meaning that there will be accountability as in Gauteng and Western Cape "Noted What is blind love for a party when they screw the poor The ANC ran the country into the ground...Moody's will downgrade us tomorrow "@welton paulse that's not true Are you an economist @Joburg CEB Lion? @Yandi Masina...your leaders instigate hate and destruction of anyone who don't agree with them.Did you ever see EFF leaders joining you when you guys destroy shops and taunt people all over SA? @peter pott Agrizzi explained in detail what happened to the servers in his previous testimony There we go...racism on steroids again "@Yandi Masina...I don't believe it The EFF is a quasi military outfit...CIC and fighters...all the monikers are military related...why?? EFF followers should take a long hard look at themselves and do introspection...your leaders are selling a lie The EFF said everyone is against VBS because it is a black bank but look what happened...corruption has nothing to do with race but the EFF brings it up ALL the time Malema was 12 years old when Mandela was released from prison...he knows zilch about history Watson sounds like a true narcissist and psychopath Hhaudli said on ration earlier he received money from Bosasa but he had an 'understanding' with Watson...I am sure people will still vote for him though *radio Neither would I @Yandi Masina in fact the last time I voted was before Polokwane.I was shook by what happened there when Malema and the ANCWL vehemently supported Zuma after the rape case Bosasa was like an ANC kitty The ANC betrayed the people...it's treason This is am open public platform the last time I checked... WoW these names are revealing.. Mrwebi at the NPA is definitely not fit to hold office The Unions have thieves too The Western Cape person was a Bosasa employee...not the DA Listening is a fine skill...don't just listen to a keyword but the whole sentence Bosasa equals ANC and vice versa @Johnny Cash dream on...corruption is everywhere...Stop saying Malema and EFF is squeaky clean...we are not stupid Land and money for mahala? what a joke There is nothing wrong with tenders...it's the people that are corrupt He is still running Bosasa Maybe he is even watching this now "Gavin Watson What us Malema doing with his friend an illegal cigarette smuggler who owes SARS millions... Vytjie Mentor just joined the ACDP I agree EFF leaders wear Gucci shoes and Breitling watches but pretend to care for the poor We are not haters...just sane and can see through the EFF

Sydwell Malibe,"guys so guys do you think the Gupta brothers will ever come to testify in this commission or chances are high that it might end without them telling their sides of the story???? guys bare in mind that SA has jst signed an extradition with AUE(dubai) meaning Zondo can order for the arrest of the Guptas for them to be deliverd in SA within a week!!!! meaning its up to zondo now @Michael Wild true. meaning its up to zondo now to order their arrest. the sooner he do that it will be for the better

BanditZA,What about EFF and VBS What about their open inflammatory remarks that are obviously meant to stir up the masses I used to love the EFF now I will never vote for them No I loved them because they addressed a need of millions of poor people that were ignored by everybody else If it wasn‚Äôt for apartheid government nobody would know about Mandela must we vote for apartheid to come back too? Stupid reasoning My man CR will see us through. Although I do hate the ANC lists @Cameron Kim uhm that exchange rate was maintained by manipulation and the forced labour of millions of people. No thanks @douglas you take that stance because you are indoctrinated. I can‚Äôt blame you. The EFF is no panacea @jeevan vote for smaller parties with local power bases. Like IFP in KZN That will distribute power and keep people in check @cameron I rather live this way than be oppressed thanks Lol I saw that Malema billboard on N2 in Durban @magda I agree that‚Äôs why I say best strategy is vote for smaller parties with local power bases @Briony that lack of empathy bleeds through @Jeevan I thought about that but as a people Indians don‚Äôt have enough votes We need to change the system so that we vote directly for MPs so that we can hold them accountable I feel that the EFF has the right message for the wrong reasons They are right in so many ways but then they throw it all away "EFF spews hate Names are coming now
Wildthing,would you let a convicted pedophilia work at a school of young children......then why would you vote EFF when Malema has already done corruption. and some of the other leaders in EFF too. Guptas cant enter India they waiting for them for corruption there too. the three brothers are stuck in Dubai. the first question I would ask the EFF is which e EFF who will fix Exdom and how. who has the experience in EFF to plan and run Exdom we need names we need A solution. where will Zimbabwe be once SA turn off the electricity going there. promising things he cant guaranty is not a leader. it's a joker. Mahkosi you get out what you put I. in unions ha ha wow NDZ went to Guptas wedding held in Dubai and last one week. then people ask where there RDP houses and social Grant's ask the top 6 Snake got so much who was that to late to expire him all the data is with Zonda already. this is just the public side. they been working on it since 2017 and maybe even 2016. ha ha he was head of ANCYL when this started and was happening now the World. ha ha some of them are lots of loaves and now it sites on there hopes. hips like Nuns so one Nun makes sure the other Nun gets non Elson you stupid.

Sebation Nantsika,VBS money started EFF @Masina why is EFF defending Tom moyane? And hlaudi "Hlaudi 
jeevan singh,Bandit why Actually it's a very difficult decision who to vote for. I am ANC now I don't know. Bas in 1894 the NIC Natal Indian CONGRESS was established. In 1912 The ANC was established. NIC disbanded in 1950s and its members joined ANC. Think I'll start the NIC again. Bandit. True. Bandit. their slogan. Africa for Africans is not right. this is ethnic cleansing. Same like what Hitler did. Zama. no from Tom Moyene Beijing don't have a university You can never win an election with a slogan. Africa for African. it's ethnic cleansing. HITLER killed millions of jews on ethnic cleansing. Cameron Egypt is in Africa. Cameron. The ANC was established by Dube and Pixley Seme in 1912. The Natal Indian Congress was established in 1894 before the ANC. Mike 100% Every vote from the ANC to the EFF is a vote gained by the DA. DO THE MATHS. Ryan. if the ANC has 20 and the EFF has 10. and the DA has 17. take 1 from the ANC and add that to the EFF. The EFF % increases and ANC %Tage decreases. Thus DA gains %tage ground on the ANC. Derreck. yep. that's a big problem with ANC voters. no thinking behind their votes. Cameron. It's lack of political education besides academic education. Rural mentality still but in time will change. hope I'm alive by then. Carnoth. By now after 25 years we should not be thinking along colour lines. what we need is is a party who can deliver services to the people. The ANC failed this for 25 years with corruption. carnoth. it's like this. if my neighbor on one side is White and steals from me and the neighbor on the other side is Black and gives me. who is a better neighbor. There is a huge vacuum since the ANC failed to deliver by the majority as to who to vote for now. Who is a better devil. EFF or DA. Jan Because the WATSON FAMILY WERE IN THE STRUGGLE pre 1994. Carnoth ANC? "Felix. true. The comrades protect each other. Dudu Myeni Vincent Smith The ANC do not spank their members for stealing. They spank them why they hit caught.

Mzalwane Mzala,Jiba and Mrhwebi will sue someone. Agrizzi turned down an opportunity to testify in the Mokgoro hearing against Jiba and Mrhwebi. Exactly @peter pott . He was not going to survive Adv. Norman Arendse @Anne M. He said being arrested did not bother him as he was cooperating with the State. @Anne M. and @peter pott Agrizzi has no knowledge that links Jiba and Mrhwebi except hearsay. He might have been fooled by Linda Mti @Anne M. It is possible that Mti pocketed the money or shared it with his former PA who is now suspended from the NPA. She was Jiba's PA and had access to all the documents. Individual union members are not the union. Thandi Makoko will never ever get a chance to clear her name. @Anne M. I have mistaken her with journalist woman who passed on. @Anne M. The person was Benedicta Dube and she is implicated My name is not on that list If I am mentioned I am not coming back to South Africa. I learnt from the Guptas. @Yin Yang The ANC has around 1 Million members I will ask for asylum in this country if my name is mentioned there. I will say there is genocide against people who looks like me in South Africa. @jeevan singh Dont distort history. @jeevan singh The SACP never refused to participate in CODESA and chris was the head of the SACP @Michael Holmes What part of Western Cape?

Dominic Przybylski,We have had a communist party and every other party is socialist so it's great to see that we finally have a capitalist party. Unions helped them to get contracts at mines. The unions demand who does catering for them. I'm not going to vote for any of the big bullshitter parties i.e. ANC DA EFF can get lost. I like the small parties with real principles. "We should get rid of SARS and just pay our tax directly to Guptas If you doing what Agrissi did you have to keep info as insurance. Cannot clean dirt. DA just haven't yet had the chance to be as corrupt as ANC. They don't have any principles. None of us know if they are liberal or socialist. Even they don't know. @Michael Holmes Compare what Mmusi says to the reality of what is happening in Cape Town. Completely different. @Michael Holmes Employment comes from creating huge incompetent civil service with average monthly salary of R36000. Even WC governmet says they must reduce the number of employees. @Michael Holmes People are being threatened in Cape Town if they generate their own electricity. R6400 fine to pay for them to come and destroy our own personal property. @Rashaka Mathode Yup. Nobody is going to defend their corruption. Corruption is normal in this country and the jails are nowhere near big enough. @Naledzani Mashau When were its glory days? "We need to vote for individuals What is racist about his testimony @Eslon Eslon ? I guess anybody who identifies himself with race is a racist. @Eslon Eslon fair enough. CR was deputy president and in top 6 through the whole saga and he didn't see anything? vote ZACP Capitalism is only way this country can be saved. Communism is for people who expect other people to do things for them but will do nothing for themselves. Comunism great in theory but in practice is a recipe for 100% corruption. "Old saying: ""If you are young and not a communist you have no heart. If you are old and not a capitalist you have no brains.""" @Johnny Cash How do you nationalise a state owned company? EFF inteligence displayed @Viwe Y I'm not a member of any party. I'm an individual not a sheep in a flock. I feel sorry for EFF supporters. Their 'leaders' have conned them. EFF clean? VBS? Google it As long as BEE continues corruption will continue. @carnoth ngomane There are none so blind as those who will not see. @carnoth ngomane I've read EFF manifesto. Not only is it unconstitutional it simply won't work. That's why EFF turned down opportunity to implement their policies in at least one municipality. @carnoth ngomane Julius is no fool. He knows his policies won't work but he also knows his followers are too stupid to realise it. Meantimve he has a cushy job as MP.
Tulonga Henoch,Agrizzi is real Italian mafia "@Felix Muyoba no wonder he knows all these codes
Jane .Blamire,"Bosasa born out of Dyambu Holdings We have had Guptas now Bosasa. Makes you wonder what other companies are out there paying bribes to these ministers.

EFF is incorruptible period. ANC members are the ones who are like Bushiri followers. Even when they see and hear so much corruption about their leaders they still defend and vote 4 the ANC. EFF is clean baba. "And if the EFF were to become corrupt tomorrow
