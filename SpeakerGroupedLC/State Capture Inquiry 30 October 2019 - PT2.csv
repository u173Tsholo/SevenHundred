Eish Greed Zuma Keep America Great At least America is governed by whites They had Obama and igw failed dismally I am a REALIST I just prefer Beagles Google it use the dictionary Get him Adv Hoffmeyer go for the kill Racism will always exist.. nothing you can do about it.. just a fact. "Derek Main pretends to be this ""Paragon of Virtue"" but he hides behind Che G??" No.. Che getting closer to the truth ü§£ü§£ü§£ ü§£ü§£killshot Catch a üêµ slowly Ms Hoffmeyer Paid but did TNA produce that many copies?? I recall getting The New Age in my post box Great now I will bank my US cheque.. just waiting for that. Gee.. Derek so you are not an ANC Patriot.. I bet you are a socialist patriot.
Rob Nel,"Head of dept Why "Well you try that in Paris We multi function She has had him all day "@Derek Main  It was stated in articles they were "So camping in a city street  Look at my response was to Thando "I am FAR from emotional. if the authorities do nothing "So after requests

Derek Main,@Thando Nkutha I agree - very sad. I can understand their viewpoint but it was always a long shot that they would be shipped somewhere else. @Thando Nkutha That's the saddest part - that kids were in the middle of all that mayhem. But their viewpoint that they were not safe in the communities they came from can't be fobbed off that easily. @Rob Nel How do you know they were illegal? @Rob Nel You misunderstood - they were camping there illegally but not necessarily in the country illegally. @Rob Nel Where did I say that? @Rob Nel Sorry but that wasn't clear. @Rob Nel I don't have a problem with them doing something but I do think we have a problem with police brutality. Think Marikana. "@Rob Nel And as we;ve learnt @Rob Nel Yes of course. It's not always a cut-and-dried issue. @Thando Nkutha I agree that they had to be moved from there - just sad at how it all turned out and feel sorry for people who have already suffer so much. @Thando Nkutha Don't get me started on Trump. üò† @Thando Nkutha Just watched video of baby being ripped from mother's arms in CT protest. Why was that necessary? You might be right - it's just as bad as Trump putting kids in cages. @Danie Nilsen I'm not either - I just know evil when I see it. @Danie Nilsen I think Zuma and Trump are cut from the same cloth. @Danie Nilsen Because he was a crook and the other is about to be fired because he is a crook. I rest my case. I can't sit here and listen to racist bile being spewed. Truth Hurts blocked. @Born free Let me help you with your spelling - RACIST. "@Danie Nilsen Seriously!?! You believe that crap? He doesn't need to because he is lining up enough business for his daughter @Born free Of course there is something each of us can do about it - refrain from being one. It's not rocket science. @Danie Nilsen I bow to your superior knowledge. @Born free Are you getting desperate? @Thabo Ditseho From teaching biology to marketing?! That's quite a change! @Thabo Ditseho OK - interesting
Lee D. Hendrix,...Pure criminality for a salary..is corruption. ...Eskom is a farm of kings with big stomachs and vile morality. Trump wants to be a king with daft religious beliefs as a governmental head of church isms. "..A bank is a money laundering system "....No one needs to know right from wrong to be considered educated and become employed in a corporation "...The man is asserting the he was doing his wrong as a part of his job "..Corporation President of the United States of America "..The word TOMORROW is not written Scriptural ..The poor Shepherds in the fields were made Holy and became the monitors of Jesus at his birth. ...People are born for a reason and its not Racism. Racism is sustained and taught by perfect people.

Thabo Ditseho,Chaucer Choeu is my former Biology teacher Not at that time I am talking 1989/80 i was doing Form 4 in 89 dont know what happened since I completed high school I mean 1979/80 Chances are he may have gone back to school to persue further studies I saw him last year at a funeral in Mafikeng My take is they do not want to tell who their handlers were life is about making choices He taught me yet I am not corrupt
