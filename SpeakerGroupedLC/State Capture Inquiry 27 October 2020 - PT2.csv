Lesige Lesige,"Anc as a whole is built on abusing power 💯 this chair kinda sus I hate that these old people get to be in positions of power everywhere while they are old n easily confused has anyone ever been prosecuted or found guilty from this commission?

Mzalwane Mzala,Court rules in favour of the DA in the Tshwane Metro matter. @Canis Africanis I'm with you. "SCA rules in DA's favour I don't know @Anne M. but this does not end the instability. Tshwane does not have a mayor the 3 biggest parties are all fielding a candidate so no one will get a 50% plus one support. The Nelson Mandela Metro (PE) have lost a lot of money as Treasury withdrew grants because there is no mayor. The DA's case was against the city being run by an administrator and the court agreed with them. @Anne M. If there is no compromise elections will be the only option. I think the corrupt are the personification of the third force @Simphiwe Kubheka . They are the enemies of the people. Bamhlukumezile @Ntsikelelo Vani Malema said he did not understand the sudden interest in his financial records when his tax woes had already been ‘leaked’ by the SA Revenue Services and published in newspapers (Citizen) "“These crooks ANC MP Bongani Bongo to appear in court over R124m Mpumalanga farm fraud (Timeslive) ANC MP Bongani Bongo is one of 11 people set to appear in court on Wednesday on fraud and corruption charges. Hawks said the suspects were linked to dubious land deals amounting to almost R124m. They did not name Bongo but a senior official with knowledge of the investigation confirmed that he was one of them @Sanjay Maharaj He even refuses to step aside Indeed @Diana Sekatane . Now they are mobilizing us based on race. Tronk toe!

Hub Grasstruths,Every operative in the state organs has gone through a rigorous process to ensure they are sufficiently parasitic and without any signs of integrity. If they blow a whistle ask only one thing:.. how and why did you find yourself in a position to observe the theft and how long did you wait to bloow the whistle The corrupt are all those who pushed neoliberalism down our throats since 1994 "what you will find is every supporter of the state will portray tenders as though they can in some parallel universe
