Walles Moyo,akuqalise phela lol lol personally i think the Guptas came with positive attributes to South Africa
Ashley Morgan,now Ist that the former president Zuma administration has place many official and Minister's into unbearable situation. Barbra Hogan testimony placed the former president in the helm of stste capture
Wesley M,Jacob Zuma is not the architect of state capture. the ANC is the architect. Zuma was just part of it. Julius Malema did not fight corruption. Malema himself is corrupt. Malema was fighting against Zuma because Zuma snubbed them and went with the Gupta's. not because of corruption. "the ANC for Ramaphosa the ANC is more important then South Africa. He will not tell you that. but look at his moves. Julius Malema is the biggest skelm. and I am not white. and I am not a DA member. I am South African. Tumelo dont let your mind be poisoned. "South Africa Tumelo are you still there? i want to tell you one last thing. Jacob Zuma is not the architect of state capture. the ANC is Zuma was only part of the. he just took things to the extreme. The ANC implemented state capture long before Zuma was president. that's Why the ANC made Zuma president. do you really want Zuma to come. he is just going to laugh at everybody. are we finished now??? "are we still having the state capture thy probably has tea. "noko you will vote ANC no matter what. not we. you vote for you i vote for South Africa. Ramaphosa is the ANC's president not the people's. if he was the people's president he would have done away with the rotten apples in the ANC already. Jacob Zuma is to stupid to be a State capture architect. the ANC is the state capture architect. the Zuma only exploited what was already in progress.
Norman Zwane,Hi all - trust people today are interested in the testimony rather their own opinions
Nelson Musoliwa,"The ANC is not on trial here but the ""ruling party is""" Zuma and Hogan opinions or personality is not the matter but government policies are.
Vusi Mbambiso,"With all due respect But we have not heard anything that even resembles state capture! All the characters so far were government officials and politicians! We need hard evidence. The judge is trained for this. And he is not naive! "@ Mopho "For now """State Capture"" is self-explanatory. It is the Capture of a legitimate government by external forces! So far none of that was said here!"
Andre' Van Zyl,all correct wesley julius will destroy this country with his hate. Its all consuming. "Ryk Botha agreed "im white. I dont hate black 19th moshakga you got a smile out of me "Thankyou Forty 2bit
tshepo aaron,"vusi beg to differ
Zoleka Mdluli,lol @Thato "No party is clean Eff-ers .. court now ordered VBS to be liquidated Noko.. what do you mean ? Thando i think Cyril moves with strategy without stiring the party.. all who c√∂nspired with Zuma will fall not by him but by their deeds.. All will be exposed
Mpho Kgomo,"Thato their uniform means serious biznis Morning Thando "@ Thando @ Andre Malema must just work on his approach because we are stuck in the past and worse @ Sphiwe Morning and welcome. "@ Nkanyiso let's hang in there and be positive @ Thando I stand with you. Zuma will testify gathering the evidence before he rocks up is imperative the more he delays the bigger the risk he is skating on very thin ice. @ Ayanda hahaha ü§£ü§£ü§£ The problem with this party is that they have hidden personal agenda's State Capture has always been around it's just that Zuma exposed the reality or its existence "I look forward to see JZ testifying @ Forty do share the Trump card "@ Thapelo she spent the day explaining policies and she held the post for a year because she did not agree to Zuma's bright idea's I feel like this country was almost auctioned to the highest bidder @ Molly how so? Homework was does Jacob mean in biblical terms and he is doing just that. @ Chauke Thank you. People which party has potential. Really this is depressing honestly @ Noko you are really not for the white community. I say make the Magowa clean up vote them in for 5 years then remove them after the spring cleaning and put ANC back just hire them for cleaning we will take it from there. Serious and drastic change Thando. No they will not loot but be under pressure to prove a point. @ Thato hahaha true that just shut up and eat.
tumelo bowman,@Wesley we do understand you are white that's why you against malema let me tell you we not scared of your whiteness

Forty is the time where Africa will invest among each other n forget abt European countries we need EFF to com in power n why can't we have Africa currency that can exchange with whites supremacy so that I can visit their country anytime I like I'm self employed baba that's y u see me busy with you tube now yes Thando we need African currency so that Africa can be powerful "African dollar can do to exchange with Euro border must be solid n safe for everybody in RSA
Speckled Trim,Who is Malema? Noko oh. thanks. people make him sound like he is more than human. "Everyone that wasnt captured was deemed ""incompetent""?" "Noko They speak without fear or favor (even if it is hate speech) Is this for entertainment purposes only or will we see some orange overalls for a change? Expensive entertainment funded by the tax payer. Niel Blomkamp should take a hint and put parliament on the Hollywood map. We can make back all the money Zupta (allegedly) stole. True guys & ladies üëç If you make a pact with 3 out of top 6 you will control the state from there üëç the rest are pawns. """walk the party line"" = blind loyalty even if it's wrong üëç" "Exactly Lawrence
lubabalo herold,i agree with u Noko yamabetlwa üëä lets debate aftr this
Bonginkosi Joseph Mpumelelo Nontso,"I am amazed by some of the revelations about the somewhat trusted people of the ANC  These people are scarvenger of the poor people and the looters are at the freedom of stupidity "The Zuma Cabal and the Guptas LETS CREATE # ZUMATESTIFY
Lorna Kavanagh,The rail deal cost SA 84 billion rand !! yes i am sure you are right Thando but i was just wondering if the deal was worth 84 billion. Malusi Gigaba .... this will be interesting. we hope that this inquiry will lead to charges been laid against 'corrupt' people and the law will take its course. SA is in a recession due to largely state capture and tax payers money stolen. I Zuma must come and tell what he is and isn't responsible for. You could be right Forty
Sphiwe Mogwere,Morning
Ilyasa musa al-indonesy,allah
Nooneisnoone,Indian curry must be delicious...
Sikhumbuzo Bulose,Judgement day for the looters as they are exposed!!!!!!!!!!!
Mark Waner,great entertainment i believe this one is different. Judge Zondo appears to be a man of utmost integrity. Zuma will never appear. and what is this trump card? You are sure how?
Jeffrey Magongoe,@Louis Eloff entertainment @NKANYISO BRANDON DUBE showing us how foolish we are as SA citizens that politicians loot while we idolise ANC mara hai
Desmond Masilela,Here come the name I was looking for.
NKANYISO BRANDON DUBE,What‚Äôs the whole point of this inquiry? How many inquiries have we had before? And what happened after? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Seems like when we took over governance. We were not read to govern. Seems to be like a movie scrip that is constantly written by different people. It‚Äôs about time we vote for policies not faces. As long as there are policy inconsistencies we are not going forward eg some are saying e-tolls must be stopped while others say they must continue.
Mzimkhulu Gqadu,There are things that are happening behind closed doors and this commision its tying to revealed all those secrets.
Fabian Moodley,"I'm sure not all evidence given about zuma is lies "zuma will get off all this stuff "I like the way zuma operates "then again I don't blame Zuma "zuma is enjoying life in Dubai
L. M,and if you add more one person then it becomes a total coup. i agree with you @Louis Eloff
Dries Koatsman,Zuma and son will come to testify no matter what. We want to hear their side of the story
Ayanda Kleyi,"By the time they get to Court or Investigated "I don't get why would this take 2 years
lawrence tele,where are these white people from Pretoria here. want to ask them why are they so racism and poor
Cassius Mngomezulu,"ZUma is the problem here "All parties are the same
Phillo Beukes,"Best you start seeing what the effect of Zuma and the ANC's theft and corruption has on you when there is no money left for water
Sthakathi Khumalo,"I praise Zuma for revolting against whiteness What is Barbra saying..though "Barbara.. Barbara "Remember it took eight years to get rid of Zuma "The problem with firing people is that "Enough about racial things "But James is correct
Wilhelm5381,what you say is rather racist...if I white person said what you have just said then the cry of racism would be expressed Zuma's period in office amounts to a parody of any idea of improvement or a better future for akk all "Khaya Siya
Lebogang Moseki,"Zuma
Thapelo Motabogi,this woman is trying to act like she didn't do anything wrong and i'm sure that she is still lying she knows about braen molefe and how he got there "she's not forgetful "she's angry cause nobody took her serious
Xolisa Faiza,anc the racist part she is brilliant ramophosa make south forward
Molly Percocet,This lady is very forgetful @Mpho because she has to be reminded of some of the stuff shes talking about....but thats just my view
Lucky123 Thwala,Think of Ventjie Mento
Thabo Mzamani,Affirm that I am the CEO. Exercise your Auothority. Lol!
Thuli Sithebe,0
Ida Lekaba,zuma was ruling people shame then why they kept quiet before things become worse guys
Athmanand Singh,The Honourable Judge will make his finding. The Law enforcement authorities will the decide to lay charges the NPA will then decide to prosecute.This will go on for another few years
Tamaryn Petersen,amazing how the innocent remember everything and the guilty remember nothing
peter pott,"this whole thing can be categorized simply this way: kathrada foundation against Fmr president zuma. members of foundation pres motlanthe
Khaya Siya,barbara is crazyi tell you "wilhelm5381 last time i checked kuku had no race...i say that becouse some of her actions i learned about in school

Ewald Kruger,üëç @Tamaryn Petersen‚Äãamazing how the innocent remember everything and the guilty remember nothing Are they on tea break guys?? Thanks @Chauke Vivian @Wesley Myburgh back on "@noko yamebetlwa‚Äã Can't cure stupid Thanks @Forty 2Bit‚Äã@Thando Nkutha. Don't say white people. That includes me and that makes your question incorrect.
Trevor B,Why would she lie? she did say document and emails were deleted on the Public interprise server
anele mtiki,FORMER PSD ZUMA MUST SHARE THE SAME JAIL CELL WITH PRAVIN AND CYRIL THANK YOU.
Chauke Vivian,yes they are welcome thanks zuma was arrogant not ANC this people were taking orders from their boss im glad that they now come clean not all of them@botha who ever was involved in that corruption c@gladwell i think everyone is watching ANC you can eat but don't do it public like they did vote ANC gus it is changing
Ryk Botha,Very funny. Everyone is telling us how bad Zuma was. But all forgot that they were the ones that kept him in Power at each non confidence vote. It shows you the anc is only thinking of themselves. Of course you got no brains at all that's why That is the problem in this country. e dont keep them to account Then you are not a DA voter Nonsense they supported him The whole of the anc supported him they are all guilty Then who do we keep to account? Can't be Zuma only We don't need nice guys. We need a President who can take charge Poor Thando. Dont let there red overalls fool you I dont care about trump. We need to fix our country first before looking at ather countries Don't agree we need to come together and stop fighting each other. We wont find peace if the politicians keep opening the wounds of apartheid. We forgot the anc ruled for 25 years. I don't care who rules the country. I just hope that no party ever will have a two thirds majority. It seems like we cannot handle the power of responsibility Thando now you talk nonsense Please do I cannot believe that Zuma is the only guilty one here. He must have had a lot of support
Thato Lekoma,ANC First then COuntry second... uryt i hope they give u a tender DA mxm mayokunya leyo DA is for white people...ANC is for elite blacks EFF is for all south africans.. we are all numbers net year.. next year must have that 1994 feeling..a new beginning for south Africa..Total revolution change is imminent. ANC is the problem for South Africa we cant gamble on The ANC they have already put this country in debt 9years of Zuma was just eat and dont ask.... polokwane conference was eat and dont ask.... tell me a white person that loved Zuma.. they dont love Zuma and Malema politics is not easy guys enemies everywhere White people are enjoying this freedom more than blacks cause nothing has changed since 1994 only right we have is a vote.we dont carry any pass anymore what an achievment by the ANC..
alain redcliffe,"im a DA voter  I am ‚Ä¶ I support Trollip ANC has issues not Ramaphosa "Is South Africa dying a slow death Yes he is the ANC President but he has power "Racism extends across all political parties  none hahaha seriously "Trump  he looked like a true cabbage on Saturday ahhaha "In order to fix our country  apartheid whats that? Ramaphosa will answer your wishes @Ryk Botha oh yeah ‚Ä¶ that's true rubbish hahahah eish and that unity is just the remedy we need Thato I think you coming across as arrogrant "They can call it ""Afros"" like Euros" joh the topics change so quick here though... next topic marine life in the indian ocean ?? hahah
Mr Q,ANC forever why swearing now? No EFF for hooligans Brother ka Floyd baba not at all.. EFF will get its nice 10% on polls true ANC There is no need of change of party in SA.. people should go to the ground and just fix the country The ones to come are also gonna loot pointing fingers doesnt help either rubbish indeed "thing is i think black racism is ignored in SA "if we continue like this we will never defeat racism.. just like GBV only focused on girls  you aint listening why is EFF chasing after Pravin so much?? what are they hiding
Moshakga Gladwell,this process will be forever i wish Zuma was listening to the mess he has done involving the ANC in this shenanigans What was the involvement of malusi gigaba in this? The DA must also testified maybe Mmusi is involved somehow who knows? What do you call a socialist politician who drives a car worth 8 million with his R124000 Loius Vutton luggage while wearing red overalls i don't want to be reminded of apartheid pls lets wait for CR to testify it then that we can decide @ van zyl I want to be your brother in law
Phuthegang Moleya,@Thando Nkutha EFF is for black only the only thing that they really reject is white supremacy
