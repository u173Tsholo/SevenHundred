Let us start here then if you need more then later @Mashamba Davhana these leaders when they are in the corner they will mention these business people throwing them to the mud to shift focus so I remain firmly those who steal on us must be in jail "@Lehlohonolo Lebere what I don’t get it is if I did wrong as a black person  "@ Lehlohonolo Lebere we all belong in this country commenting about something wrong means that I am concerned about future of this country "Mandela and Tambo left legacy and direction our country was supposed to go "My plea is to respect all people and try to work together to solve problems of our country "@ Makwa Choma exactly destroys what they built "If ANC doesn’t correct itself I can assure you that one day they will wake up without bread this is last chance "@Martha mathuba be careful what you are saying about people as I said respect others that will help you understand these problems "Ace Magashule is going to be out of the NEC watch the space @ Funicanz kakubi usebenzisa kakubi President and yinyani akabhali neminutes ezi 😂😂 @ Sindiswa moolman 🤞🤝✊✊ "@ Sindiswa Moolman he didn’t accept the offer when he was given which he turned Ajay down Thabo Manyoni when is coming to testify?

Madelein R,"Morning "@Antonie Engelbrecht 
Antonie Engelbrecht,mr x initials is sp zondo really acting stupid
Lucricia Vorster,but Ace is already on record We might be witnessing the fall if the Ace of spades.I am sure alot of ppl in bfn will be hapoy he has really just used ppl for self enrichment.fs is suffering because of him..dukwana aint scared ignorance is bliss... this isn't about black or white it is about tge principle of taking accountability... wonder why ppl would refer to this as boring you are fundamentally saying ohbits okay take my taxmoney i am not interested in it just keep japping... oh but ofcourse yes..greed always the issue it is just a shame that a book of that type should even be penned.... Gangster State one year later and no arrests... remember angelo agrizzi was threatened at gunpoiny when he first started speaking...he still carried on..when we keep quiet about sinful wrongdoings we are just as guilty i would say majority yes i feel people also get bullied inyo doing this for fear of survival or lack thereof but no one ever go to jail really man why are there so many 'old' folks in these top brass positions??? they will have to make do with what they get in jail Actually ehat do we expect when a judiciary system is compromised... i agree with white hair that has more experience..but quite clearly they not showing any of that That man is alive and kicking man i might be green but i am not a cabbage if you are 70+ years and u had a privileged life since u were born..isn't it a bit strange that yiu cannit operate a manual vehicle surely u must have been taught driving skills using a manual car okay barbara whooo touchy and fyi thats how some ppl with their own view says it...jeeeez calm down and thats why we wont progress we always attack the person and not the issue at hand.. Who actually must ask for forgiveness.. This is a crime against humanity not against black white indian or whosoever..everyone is affected by what happened here and with all other corrupt activities and institutions.. but this asbestos issues wasnt even tendered for.. it was given no tenderbor bid was advertised tebogo what actually have u so angry??? funny that people can still say kill the boer but we may not wave the old flag anymore..contradictory i would say who is 'the boer'??? what land exactly be specific man what do u mean by get rid ????

Racism in any form is hurtful and shameful. Indulging in racism is equally shameful. Discussing the impact of racism is another issue altogether but must be constructive and progressive. @Raven Penny I am absolutely sure that it was shoes and not t shirts???? @Raven Penny Are you looking for me? @Raven Penny Some Devils are just too big for us mere mortals.

Derek Main,@Gee Peex1 As the asbestos rooves get older they deteriorate and give off asbestos dust and fibres. @Leeroy Lepere Vote for a government that is accountable and that wants to improve citizens lives ad not just their own. @Pastor J I think that any party would be better than the ANC. @Salmaan Abrahams Would you like some tomato sauce with those chips on your shoulders? @Salmaan Abrahams You're right - those chips are monstrous. You need industrial grade tomato sauce. @Jngle Pssy I call BS on that. @Salmaan Abrahams Yawn @Salmaan Abrahams Racist much? @Gee Peex1 All I hear is victim-speak. @Gee Peex1 All I read is him spewing racism. How does that help anything? I hate ALL racists. @Salmaan Abrahams Wjat's your excuse? @Salmaan Abrahams That's what we expected the ANC govt to deal with. They chose to line their pockets instead. @Jack Sparrow - Yes - we're in Apartheid Ver 2.0 "@Thando Nkutha How am I supporting racism? I'm not saying the apartheid we have now is identical to what it was previously but right now @Thando Nkutha I know I'm not racist - I couldn't care less if you called me one. @Salmaan Abrahams Please see my reply to Thando - I never said the situations are identical - only that whotes are now unfairly discriminated against based on skin colour. "@Thando Nkutha @Salmaan Abrahams - If you can't see that "@Salmaan Abrahams I have no issue with restitution and agree that it must happen. However @Salmaan Abrahams So you are justifying unfair discrimination based on race. That's what apartheid was. @Salmaan Abrahams My problem is that you try to paint all whites with the same brush. There are many whites who want exactly what you want - that poverty should be dealt with. That is racist. @Salmaan Abrahams Cape Town @Tebogo Makoro I don't think even that will be enough for the haters. All I can say is that the Nat govt did a fine job in making SAfns hate each other. That legacy continues. They would be proud of the haters. @Gregory Werner You are not making sense - the aim of the Nat govt would be to have more whites in management. Much in the same way that the ANC govt wants more blacks in management. ANC is = NAT. @Gregory Werner Not at all - I think that they are mostly corrupt scumbags. @Tebego Makoro Perhaps you need to take the corrupt ANC to task for that. @Tebogo Makoro So you agree with that method of empowerment? @Tebogo Makoro And yet you are happy to support it when it benefits only blacks? @Tebogo Makoro You are right - I am making assumptions based on your posts. Am I wrong to assume you hate all things white?

I suspect he got more than that... before the R10K @funicanz @funicanz Hope he’s clean then @makhosi nobhatyi and @ funicanz Now I can trust what he says @Thando Nkutha Mna would @Ryan Smith. For me @Raven Penny... it’s about the jobs and whether they can deliver to all SAns. We have enough institutions that can hold them accountable. Some of us will do anything to make sure that our kids get the best education. The question to all involved ... the Morakes and then now is whether it was worth it. Say it again @makhosi nobhatyi. Is this Mpambani person still alive? It looks like he was the Agrizzi of FS I suspected that. I remember reading about him. Thanks @funicanz Thanks @Concerned South African Yaaa... now I recall @funicanz I think he will be protected now. I don’t think Ace thought he was a risk to him @Ewald Kruger There are many in the organization who were mentioned here but still in government. So it wouldn’t be consistent if the ANC to take any action against Ace @funicanz. I think we should be a bit patient Mxolisi’s producing the receipts of what is covered in the Gangster State Asinandlela @funicanz. Masibe nomonde It annoys me when others mention Stratcom whenever the journalists report on certain individuals @Rob Nel Ufelani uMpambani lo? We need his testimony now Half of that loss is sitting at Eskom @Rob Nel Yhooo what a loot!!!How much was the total of this ntshotsho? Really @ Mahlomola Mofube? It makes sense that he has all the receipts You are so passionate in your arguments on this topic @Tebogo Mokoro. I love that and I’m enjoying it. She has a rep in this Commission @Gee Peex1. She’s working behind the scenes. 2020 is the year of Prosecutions and I believe that wholeheartedly
Ndumiso Mbele,😂😂😂if the ANC choose Ace to be a president do you guys support him?

Wildthing,you all fighting each other while the employees of government are stealing peoples future and each time they want to divert attention they push the race thing. start focusing on good and bad. Salmann that is not true you need a good business case to raise money from investors or banks. not the other way around. not yet I dont have a business case that shows proof of making profit. once I have a good plan and proof I will go for the opportunity. I no action has been take today after yesterday's allegations against Ace like takingbthis guy to court then he is on to something that is true. "Tebogo most Tebogo how old are you. I am past 50

I must have missed something the ANC seem to be very disturbed people! soulless or demon possessed! Privilege is has a driver!
