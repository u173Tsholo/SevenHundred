Caweni Dombo,Volume is too low
Pheladi Lamola,I thought Agrizzi has a little black book. How did he make such a mistake?
Mukumbuta Nyambe,indeed its a mistake volume is too low Imagine
Anne M.,I was thinking the same thing @Pheladi Lamola "DCJ went live to rule on an application against Agrizzi. The commission is adjourned until 10 when they will start with the scheduled witnesses @Justin Kennerley Both h ave journalists
Molalign Asefa,please volume too low
Potlaki Sefojane,volume please

Windy Kagisho,The ANC has destabilized the Economy of our Country.
Jngle Pssy,"it's not ramaphosa 
Nicky Klue,let the party start . cant wait for ace to give ( his side of the story ) not ace today my friend not sure when i really feel for watsons wife and children . the must be so embarrassed ny his actions but 2 bribe and corrupt is a wrong thing to do lets start talking about us as people not black ot white so as none of us feels as if he is better than another
Moses Sowage,is it ace today? okay
Smart Guys,the country is burning and where is Cyril Ace Must be attending Gavin Watsons funeral today
Solutions SA,SABC CEO today Goodmorning Chairman SABC CEO today @Lorna That's the contrast if the past isn't it? Whites voted for apartheid gov @Lelatsa same SABC is more descriptive of the SOE he comes from and GCEO doesn't tell of which company @Lelatsa Lorna
luzuko masoka,where is witness let us pay TV Licences
Lorna Kavanagh,South african vote like Zimbabweans even though the ruling party has ruined the country. Sidney ... .... but is this the way to go when the ruling party cannot govern the country? Rather vote for a party who can rule properly. For the record i didn't vote NP. The DA would be better. I have faith in Ramaphosa but not sure about others in the ANC . Carnoth .... the DA was nothing like the NP. DCJ is really upset. When will all these criminals come to court? Depressing to hear all this about SABC
Lelatsa Raphula Daniel Khang,"Some saying sabc ceo yet I saw that its written GCEO. So
Granny Mokwena,how can these cowards targeting women and children be dealt with? "men are troubled in this country "the enablers of corruption the protection of corruption by the ruling party can they just jail one person? no they won't
Hlobi Molemohi,GCEO stands for Group Chief Executive Officer
carnoth ngomane,"@Granny Mokwena such must be castrated and have their hands chopped @Lorna Kavanagh which party can govern the country properly? "@Lorna Kavanagh DA is simply the replication of NP "@Lorna Kavanagh DA is against anything that seek to improve African lives "@Thando Nkutha you are correct
Singi Mathebula,cut or remove any part of their body which is troubling them@Granny stiil to be conceived @ngomani agree. but let3 not streep naked as well. @granny Deputy Chief Justice for presidentüëå "and zuma will proudly ask South Africans DJC is now talking from the heartüò±üò± where is Batohi? she has to start somewhere. white owned diamond and gold but the built N1 and other strategic infrastructure for thei economy to grow. but ANC thugs consumed every cent through their mouths and later visited the toilets. how many of the COSATU leaders have studied Economics? workers and bussiness must pay more taxes for SoE's to survive. theory and practice are different @Sabelo
Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,this guy looks like a private schooled Bheki Cele....
PETER STAFFEN,carnoth ngomane for your info NP went into the ANC pule tsotetsi it the directors themselves that earn the big salaries
Derek Main,The ANC has become just like the NP - they learnt well from the oppressors. Any party that doesn't steal public funds will do better than the ANC - they are corrupt to the core. A bunch of criminals. "If you can't see by now that the ANC is poison to SA It's a cANCer. "@pule tsotetsi I'd even take the EFF before ANC - at least there is still some doubt about how corrupt the EFF is - with the ANC @Yin Yang Yeah - everything the ANC touches turns to s**t. I only want to know where he is buried so I can spit on his grave. @Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu I believe he is dead but I don't believe it was an accident. @mahfuz8599114 You don't seem to realise how insignificant we are in the bigger scheme of things. @Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu I don't discount that possibility (for the reasons you've given). That's why I think it was a planned suicide. The timing of his death was just far too convenient. @Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu There are just too many questions. Why did he not fly through the windscreen? Why wasn't there a lot of blood since he have large gashes to his neck and face. @Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu Why didn't he brake? Why no cellphone or briefcase? Why in Toyota? Where was he going? @Justin Kennerley No - you don't always but he wasn't wearing a seatbelt and was going very fast. He should at least have hit his head on windscreen (if not gone right through). @Justin Kennerley Are you saying no dummies go through windscreen? I would be very surprised. @Yin Yang Yep - our ANC cadres have no qualms about fraternising with criminals. Birds of a feather and all that. @Michael Wild You might be right - I'm just not sure about that. Brazen looting = lack of money
Paul Buchel,How many got fired???....... 0 The Human resources department is the worst.
Philisiwe Gumede,MaGUMEDE

Francel van Eeden,white people arent against it they want sustainable transformation without corruption
Johnny Cash,South Africa is burning - literally the streets are burning - and not ONE criminal politician from Zuma era has been charged. ANC has failed this country. The entire organisation is disgustingly corrupt. Corrupt and incompetant
pule tsotetsi,But EFF would be worse than ANC. ANC is a better devil retrench and reduce salaries in order to cut employee costs "again media personalities are paid a lot than they deserve "with regards to Xenophobia
Henry Mayambu,I would agree with @pule tsotets. I am of the view that EFF does not have leadership to drive a country. ANC has really destroyed the economy of this country.
Tshepang Malatsi,"the biggest issue is the strike in Pretoria
Lucretia Mohaswane,sad story indeed judge‚òπÔ∏è

Oupa Peter Makinta,The Country got in to this trouble .....for the love of money...
Adelaide Sisasenkosi,talk about Xenophobia
Kevin Simon,State Capture lead to State Paralysis.....ANC Cadres in Parliament just covering their earnings base. NOT trying to hold the Executive Accountable.

Born free,Gavin Watsons enabler of corruption is at his funeral.. Zuma Watson is a coward. Yin Yang.. who would volunteer to die in his place?? True it could have been a Dummy judge him by his last days.. don't you mean the years since 2009 Those that fought apartheid gave long since left SA. They are enjoying their lives in Britian never to return. Those that fought for change don't live in SA any longer and have not since 1994 They fought for change and when there became change.. they ran away. ANC recycles its corrupt members.
RC Swart,Ironic that we're watching this on SABC
Ruddy Matlala,you mean he run away from his responsibilities?
funicanz,300 ACTING POSITIONS? "@Sabelo Mbatha  "@mthetheleli mndawe

BARRY HEAVEN,hi everybody "Ace
Patrick Mavimbela,follow this proceedings !
Wildthing,Judge Zondo. also ask the question about when will unions be removed. they are the once protecting bad useless workers from been laid off and good people hired. Neo walking a thin line. stop the blame game and bring up ways to fix it. many students and people qualified looking for work that can replace the thieves out there. and they would do a better job Justin/Derek. is it not a charge if you witness a crash and dont stop to help or call the police. I find it odd that both witnesses did not stop and only came forward 2 days later. they should charge "and the Cell phone still a mystery Neo you here to talk about the subject or raise other issues. there are courts to claim land it you have proof.
mahfuz8599114,rsa 1652 cpt built entire sa to whom it may concern and be cool calm and collective viva azania world should kiss our rsa hands you all are pro no doubt
Raven Penny,flatten sa and lets start afresh let's call for commission to send you back from where you come from neo go back to upper Africa
Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu,guys who believes that watson is actually dead 4 real....or it's other way to end all of this in the public eye.....um saying this cs Zuma said he'll talk...and when he was called he revealed a lots @Derek main ...lets agree to disagree cs i believe that his testmony would hv implicated lots of ppl on ur gov n that would scare away investors....so they agreed to fake his dead to end his part
Monica Mkhwebane,a
Karen x,What a fool you are Neo....Neo Mongale‚ÄãWe call for a commission of inquiry into apartheid and colonization now
Mike Jones,Yes Neo...That would really help our future. When that comm's completed we can start another one to ventilate Chaka's brutalization of minor tribes.
Chris Welensky,they say one thing you can be sure of is death and taxes..imagine having some much money like GW that you kill yourself!
Justin Kennerley,@Derek Main you don't always fly through the windscreen. Suicide seems the most likely answer. "Go watch crash test videos "@Ibo Thabo News24 and DM are newspapers "They have different mandates. The SABC journalists broadcast heir news "@Ibo Thabo exactly my point @Pastor J they moved to the digital space due to lower newspaper sales. Suffers Lack of money = lack of improvement and innovation Plus a lack of leadership that effectively enforces rules and prcoesses.
thando cezula,It's nice at the Gavin Watson funeral!
Pastor J.J,@Michael Wild You are very right. A law does exist that requires every licensed motorist to stop and render and/or request assistance in the event of an accident and injuries @Justin Kennerley Just a very small point to be made. News24 is probably a medium sized broadcaster of live events both on the Youtube platform and their own news site. This commission is live correct@Justin Kennerley Lets blame it all on the Silly Goat Cloudy Hlaudi. @Makwa Choma Maybe tomorrow or friday. SAPS dont work on weekends .Only 8 to 4pm daily. ü§£ü§£ü§£
mthetheleli mndawe,This lady is all over the place
Keith Hodgson,This advocate needs to prepare the words in her mind before speaking - very annoying hesitancy all the time.
Reward Mushayabasa,She is very likeable. Always deferring to the chair
Ibo Thabo,who she? thanks @Nomsa Mdhluli So she is the right person to be ask the bugling mind question on: why the SABC website is so rubbish and their articles are so nonsensical & short in such way you can‚Äôt compare them to news24 or DM? "@Justin Kennerley I said website "@Justin Kennerley most if not all of the SABC website and twitter accounts are badly written "@Justin Kennerley Can you look at CNN "@Justin Kennerley I guess not just staff shortage but intelligence @Justin Kennerley Keep in mind the over R250 million salaries we pay to those incompetents every month
Moshoeu Mabusela,Hlaudi is coming finally. can't wait to see him exposed. @Muzi Dube. he has been invited
Nomsa Mdhluli,@Ibo Head of news
Muzi Dube,@Mabusela....chief is that offical????????????????? if so I can't wait!!!!! love that human being!!! @Mabusela hope he accptes the invite...
Ziyanda Tshangana,yhoooooo
