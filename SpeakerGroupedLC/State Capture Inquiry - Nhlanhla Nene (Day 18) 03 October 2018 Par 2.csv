mfumo walter maluleke,where is the volume
Andrew Mabele,contradicting statements...this guy must be charged immediately.Purgery
MASAMBAG,which contradicting statement are you on about Andrew ? "just like the noise EFF ( Malema) made regarding the appointment Nombembe as the head of investigation at this commission
Danie van Rensburg,Andrew is a BLF agnet
sbusiso mzobe,where is Dali Mpofu he would have fun getting sharp answers from Nene
Giftlebohang,"Nene- In April
The Vuka Experience,He‚Äôs being more honest that previous statements. I think he understands the outcomes will have harsh implications on him. "@Alex Mbontsi basically ewe "@Alex Mbontsi that might be the case yes "Well there are more people to come and testify Remember Duduzane also agreed to appear and testify. This is gonna get hotter. Aijaman üòÇüòÇüòÇüòç "@Aijaman @Aijama if there is a link between the state capture and buses we‚Äôll hear about it. You are too woke!
Wesley M,"look we had the freedom struggle he does devious things for fun.
Alex Mbontsi,@King Vuka....so basically Mr Nene lies depending what outcome suits him? I still think he is being selective to ensure that he is not implicated Yes he repented that I believe but he must not come play us to imply that he was not part of the group I‚Äôm still to understand what he considered the Guptas as before they were a ‚Äúhot potato‚Äù and my assumption is he would say we were friends but saying that now would put him in a bad light As I see it...Mr Nene was part of the clique until the Guptas took it too far and he knew that he was in too deep and he started being uncooperative Let‚Äôs be honest...The South African government is rotten so as the private sector State Capture goes beyond the time of Zuma @Wonga Masiza ...I fully agree but after this we have to go back before Zuma because the issue with SA is structural
Desmond Masilela,They ask him question then he respond by reading from his script..... Whose next after Nene? because i dont see where we are going with Nene..honestly Yes @Wonga Masiza Fully agree with you @Aijaman Pirlo This Inquiry is just like TRC.. Thank you @Aijaman Pirlo yes pleaese say in Isizulu
ndieni rasikhuthuma,Minister Nene saved this country period
Teboho Khiba,why is he selecting information he thinks is important to us.
Kingsley Mathe,"If you want to save your skin do like they did during the eskom inquiry
Aijaman Pirlo,When GUPTAS was chowing money with Zuma like nobodies business. Petrol was cheaper... BRING BACK GUPTAS Petrol iyadura bakithi Peit you lie Bring back GUPTAS and Zuma..Petrol was cheap under them..... Everthing is expensive these days yet we are still blaming other people. When you corrupt squandering money. You immidiately suffer because the money is not properly channelled. Whe we only suffer now They say petrol is expensive because of Zuma. Why it was not expensive that time because Zuma was corrupt with his friends including Nene. Why we only suffer now? Why now not at that time when Guptas were taking everything Rand lost value more than it was during the corruption of Guptas and Zuma. Why it never lost value that time? Auti irrespective of Zuma selling PetroSA strategic what what. Fact is Petrol was cheaper as compared to now. Why it was not expensive at that time? "I warn South Africans "Auti Mjita - I've been driving since I was 23 now I am 39. I can easily tell the difference on petrol price. Under Zuma This inquiry is just a smokescreen to play dirty politics. We won't benefit anything out of this nonsense Mark my words True Desmond Auti Mjita might think he is smart thinking that we will benefit something out of this nonsense. Mark my words. 2019 will come and go and nothing will have been done by that time Black people do not fly all the time. We use buses when we cross country. I do not care about SAA. I did not fly for 15 years yet black people are made to be so concerned about SAA and forget the major issues Not even a single Airbus which fall off the sky yet we so focused on it. Lets talk about Jobela buses and City to City buses and their standards because people die all the time on the road We are black lets be concerned about issues which hit the poorest. Some-1 in Alexandra doesn't even know where is OR Tambo in JHB but that person is made to worry about SAA not City City "Lets all come back here after this hearing and debate. Believe me uZuma uyityile imali uyityile. Akangowokuqala!!!! He did nothing just like the presidents before him. Just like Ramaphosa is doing now The widows of Marikana mine workers are yet to be paid anything till today. Now you say BFF is holding the payment yhoooo So BFF got powers of holding governments payments? hehehehehehe hay yhoooo "I am repeating I remember when Andries Tatane passed on. There was a commision. What happened after that commision? Nothing Auti Mjita - you think you smart as a result you don't look at reality. Mbeki squandered the FIFA money under the disguise of African diaspora. Mandela and his group of stellenbosch was corrupt Every president we once had was corrupt. De Klerk funded the killings in Boipatong and PolaPark..No commision ever established to look at these previous presidents but Zuma was corrupt just like them. There is commision. Why because 2019 is around the corner and this commision is just a smokescreen "Zwelethu - I promise you mfethu SAA new international route....mximmmmmmmmmm
abraham rambuda,oh my... that young lady that is seating near Mr Pretorius. Can someone get me her number please. lol @Wonga Masiza even if I promise the position in cabinet you won't give me her name and number? @Skhumbuzo Nkosi yes broer don't wanna lie. she is too hot Yes @Slindile Ngcobo it's so true @Wonga Masiza are you serious bro? @Thokozani Malgas oh you wish broer No @Wonga Masiza my wife would kill me if she sees this. I am just joking @Aijaman Pirlo actually you are not lying but exposing your stupidity and ignorance. There are many circumstances that play into the issue of petrol as like international oil prices and the rand @Mluleki Mnguni by who? @Sindiswa Moolman ungatsho uphinde kwakhona @Mluleki Mnguni power to summon or not that does not apply to Dudu Myeni as she is above the law that one. She will not come anywhere near the commission @Sindiswa Moolman Tina Joemat Pietersen was just as a victim as Nene was @Zwelethu Ayanda Sodwele tyhini uyaxoka All of you guys who are singing praises for that beautiful lady next to Adv Pretorius i hope your wives are not watching this otherwise your wives might institute this commission in your house @Mluleki Mnguni and @Keryn I am serious honorable members you know how these women are like
Delphin kapeta,Who knows the girl sitting next to counsel?
Piet Madimetja,the course of expensive petrol and tax is because of Zuma and his friends
Skhumbuzo Nkosi,@abraham she's hot
Mpho Mashigo,This NUCLEAR program has the potential to power half of Africa... and this fool has delayed it... coal is running out in mpumalanga and we have huge deposits of uranium üò≥ BRICS was going to fund it... that's why Zuma joined BRICS... The IMF is RAPING AFRICA Petrol is expensive because the USA has sanctioned IRAN and BRITISH PETROLEUM (BP) GETS ITS OIL FROM Iranüò≥ SAA is in trouble because they stole it's planes ... tell people the Truth Neneüò°üò°üò° THE DOLLAR IS A SCAM. NOT GOLD BACKED NIX
Slindile Ngcobo,"She's what you call :BEAUTY and BRAINS"""
Auti Mjita,@Aijaman Pirlo Are you stupid or just trying hard to sound stupid? "@Mpho Mashigo And who would have paid your social grant? the country would have been broke @Aijaman Pirlo The fact that you don't recognize continuity in policy and governance disqualifies you from commenting on ish you are clearly ignorant about "@Aijaman Pirlo Ask your Zuma why PetroSA sold our strategic fuel reserves "@Aijaman Pirlo FACT is you are ignorant about fuel prices nywe nywe fuel prices where lower under Zuma but you forget that they were even lower under Mohlanthe and Mbeki @Aijaman PirloIt is sad to see an old man without an ounce of brains but let me clarify "1. No president sets fuel prices "2. Check where the ZAR was irt the dollar during Zuma years "3. what made things worse now is that the orange man in the states has decided to cut off IRAN @Aijaman Pirlo Are we still talking about your hero zuma or have you moved on to 2019? "@Aijaman Pirlo Black people do fly "@Aijaman Pirlo It seems you have a lot of issues to raise "@King Vuka He is a sleepyist bra "@Aijaman Pirlo Tell that to your Zuma who was in power for over 9 years "@Aijaman Pirlo FYI "@Bongile Sibali We are trying to educate those that receive free Zupta data so they can go around sanging Zuma praises "@Aijaman Pirlo Your BFF did not act of the report "@Aijaman Pirlo Not payments bra "Plus his government promised the Marikana widows cash "This is when education matters "@Aijaman Pirlo You are asking all the correct questions but to the wrong people "anyway "@Aijaman Pirlo I don't think im smart bra "@Aijaman Pirlo now we are on Mbeki and 2010 "@Aijaman Pirlo AGAIN @Aijaman Pirlo THE ONLY ONE CONFUSED HERE IS YOU BROTHER has he blocked me yet? hahahahahahahaha "@Thiza William He is behaving like a toddler now "@Tina Joumase Petterson sold our strategic fuel reserves The ANC in the thick of things again! "Mantashe was SG @Xhanti Silvester He might get a 6pack at the end of this commission @Keryn He managed to fool us all ZONDO IS WAITING FOR ZUMA YOH "@Keryn Nywe Nywe im a victim "@Keryn It's not up to him to decide
Mbudzeni Mphaphuli,"We owe Nene a great deal for not signing the Nuclear deal
Thiza William,if we go back preZuma era till when its the cut time of investigation? There's no fiends but intetests if you think China is our saviour unless you don't understand international relations or outright gullible "surely before Zuma the bread was cheaper Some need to understand economics its so sad to witness such ignorance litre of petrol in 1994 was three rand Something doesn't add up with reasoning capacity of Zuma supporters Once beaten twice shy. Sua forces must be fought in all platforms of our open society and exposed for how destructive they're Bringing the past shows a poverty of discussion. Engage on the current narrative being presented than diversionary tactic Anyway Mbeki and De Klerk are not on trial in the court of public opinion political tantrums won't help Zuma evade prison Zuma appears next month to greet the judge in court again but this time around to plead either guilty or not His been requesting his machine gun for the last 10 years and he will soon get it in a form of orange jumpsuit The list of criminal syndicate is growing No stone must be left standing to haunt all Zuma supporters
Crispian Gallon,We definitely need to thank Nene. Otherwise we would have been downgraded even further. And the next generation would have to pay as well @Pirlo even if we dont use SAA we the taxpayers paid for it. @Pirlo. in simple terms buy now pay later
Thokozani Malgas,"That's my wife you guys talking about
Nhlamulo Ngonyama,sabc 404 needs audio please. audio on Sabc 404 is still not coming through and data is still expensive. production team please help

Sindiswa Moolman,We are all here from eNCA He is earning his normal salary. This is not extra for him. I wonder who will be brave enough to submit that request @Mluleki Mnguni. I know Zuma wont because he knows he is guilty. Dudu refused to account to the Parly Eskom inquiry ...and then go and meet Zuma in a hotel @thando cezula "Dudu Is he still your President @peter pott ? Agreed @Thiza William . Now we have added Joemat-Petterson and Mahlobo to the list of known suspects We are talking about Zuma here @thando cezula Why would she ask the Fin Minister to sign a blank cheque based on one pager document that commits the country to a half trillion debt?
