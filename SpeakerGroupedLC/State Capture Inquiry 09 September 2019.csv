jasper dougal,"What is his purpose here today  Biggest thief ever in ZA! Qualifications - outright thief ! "So  His arrogance knows no bounds ! "How often has he been found lying  "Bet he doesn’t state his biggest achievement though  How come there are no Senior Evidence Leaders to deal with this dubious character An Old Zondo having a laugh with this piece of crap "So all day is going to be given over to his arrogant statements I feel so frustrated that this Commission has no real talent apart from one female advocate !
Robert Russell,There is Super man and then there's SUPPER thief Dr Ben Here we go already..... liar as well..... 2016 Looted Eskom I was hoping for Kate Hofmeyer to be here today "@Pastor J .... I tend to agree with Joe.... I too am a South African (white) and we are always told to go back to Holland... and that we are being allowed to live """"For Now""""" @Sphamandla Masikane ..... no I'm not but did a lot of work with the SABC Here comes the lies AGAIN Your ignorance will be the death of you.... Shoprite is a listed company on the JSE and shares are also held by BLACK's @Leeroy Lepere So what to you suggest...... loot the JSE??????? @Leeroy Lepere You and your criminals will then have South Africans running to Zimbabwe..... poetic justice I say.... @Leeroy Lepere "This is what is referred to as """" Black Excellence"""" in business" @Leeroy Lepere ..... and who is your master then? @Leeroy Lepere....... if you want to think of that way then then that's up to you Oh okay..... are we talking about the dude from Water Fall Boven? @Pastor J ......100%..... But I'm affriad that you are not going to find these leaders in the ANC.... they are too corrupted for the next 2 generations. @Pastor J I would not be surprised if all this violence and criminality is not brought about by the ACE/ZUMA faction to make SA ungovernable Yeah that sounds like a great idea.... leave Mabazu as acting CEO and re-appoint Dr Ben as chair again..... that should finish off Eskom once and for all @Madelein Huxtable

clive oconnell,Technology insolvent does he mean everything the ANC touched with its management. @Leeroy Try living in our real world not fantasy lands like Venezuela and Zimbabwe
Nokuthula Magudulela,@ J Dougal Adv Norman is Senior and very capable. But I guess because she's a woman her seniority is not recognized. We are inherently a sexist society "@Dougal this Comission has another SC
Mzalwane Mzala,Former Minister from the IFP I agree with you @Nokuthula Magudulela Is it possible for Dr Ben Ngubane to be corrupt when he is not ANC? I don't know but I know this one was an IFP minister. I believe your claim about Hlaudi if you say he was not ANC. So they got two bonuses Tony Leon was also appointed ambassador and he is still DA Joining a party can not be assumed.
Makatleho Moorosi,Who is he..kindly? @Leeroy Lepere what is mayibuye iAfrica? Please dearest please let us not hate our own blood for no valid reason!
Person of interest,I agree Nokothula
Leeroy Lepere,Loot Loot!!! Guys its quiet now when are we looting Woolworths when is the state capture going to end we want to start looting again this time we loot major stores like your clicks and stuff we need a two month shut down in SA we need to see whos who in the zoo "@Pastor J will do we also lootong car dealerships we taking whatever we want its our country anyways @Makatleho Moorosi im targerting white people they own all these shops like shoprite etc africa is for africans this state capture inquiry wont help us even if they find out the truth what is going to change? @Robert Russell JSE doesnt help the majority of africans thats the problem @redriger thats what they said on june 15 1976 but we didnt listen and the next day we changed history @Robert Russell i suggest we loot all the white own companies then things will cahange @redriger that question is irrelevant however my statement made a point which i think you understand @This Is Balls they are my brothers @Robert Russell @redriger i can tell you guys are privileged enough not to see that its the white people need to leave us as the reason theres xenophobia is because of you right now SA has xenophobia and ask your self which race stands to gain the most? wake up black people we are the majority but the minority has more power and money @Yin Yang we are modern day slaves look at the facts theres a high unemployment rate in SA which affects black people however we still employ foreign nationals? @Robert Russell you are my master @Peter Staffen your ancestors are Africans are suffering My Brothers right now White people are at mugg and bean while you struggle "my black brothers dont let white people fool you we are modern day slaves this inquiry is just to confuse you we need to loot all white owned businesses need to be closed @Michael Wild block the truth like white people always do
Isidingo Love more,this ppl are friends their all corrupt
Pastor J.J,@Joe Peterson I am South African and I am not Xenophobic or a Thug. And neither is my friend @Thando Nkutha . So @Joe Peterson withdraw or rephrase your statement @Leeroy Lepere Pleeeeeex dont discriminate and make sure to check the expiry date when you stealing the bread and milk. @Leeroy Lepere And dont forget to say a Prayer before u eat the bread to make sure you dont choke Baba Who is he? @Phillip Blair Never heard of him or the party @Phillip Blair No name comes to mind and perhaps none will soon enough @Phillip Blair We will pray for another Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela to emerge and ensure this beautiful country rises again to the Glory and success it so richly deserves @Dumisani Nxumalo Respectfully and sadly I cannot agree with you. @Robert Russell We should never encounter and experience the tragedy that the ANC delivered to destroy this country to what it is now. @Robert Russell This country does not need Politicians. We need a Management Council who comprise of Professional people who are tried and tested. Never a Politician...... @Phillip Blair We once had a Presidents Council of about 20 professionals that supported the Mandela Presidency. That was possibly the best time economically post Apartheid. Perhaps Yes @Phillip Blair "@Thando Nkutha Absolutely true. That is why the 1st question I ask someone who says please pray for me is ""did you pray for yourself""" @Hennie Vatso Amen to that @Phillip Blair Interesting perspective @Cerebis Follow his career path and you will see the disaster he left in his path. This is a one man Tsunami @Phillip Blair I watched many of those seminar videos and i still do. Very enlightening but our bunch of Politicians are a unique bunch. Beyond help sadly yes he was @Dumisani Nxumalo Largely we disrespect each other. We dont need foreigners to teach us disrespect. I agree @Dumisani Nxumalo Respect is Patent and Latent. You eith have it and was born with it or not. "Crime @Phillip Blair Elements within Govt who have failed their responsibilities @Lex Luger 100% agreed @carnoth ngomane It seems to have all the trademarks

makhosi nobhatyi,@ carnoth ngomane he is lying indeed How did listeners hold ministers accountable mr Ngubani? When Guptas enter at SABC things start to be soar Yes it is him @ Thando Nkutha Financial skills nothing 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ as CEO They were given this Hlaudi by Zuma and Ace Magashule How did uneducated men run SABC over graduates? Isn’t the reason why SABC now have headache financially and stress management Failing at SABC and be moved to Eskom to open up doors for Guptas
