Dembe Doyoyo,what's time they are starting here we go
Smart Guys,what time are they starting?
Anne M.,"Supposed to be now "@He lives in you I had to look it up Different surname @Mikey Likesit I assume you're referring to Oscar Pistorious. This man's surname is Pretorius. "@Jabu Malinga I stand to be corrected @SABC Digital News Please check the sound level. Volume seems a bit low. @Jabu Malinga Agree - it should be all hands on deck to try and sort out the problem. "@Danie Nilsen It's about TNA It was Gupta owned @Danie Nilsen @Mikey Likesit Exactly my question. Yup Hello @Pastor J. I wondered if you were watching today. Lack of conscience?
Derrick saperstein,Supposed to be 10 am "Pastor J
Vutomi Mkhabela,"Morning everyone i like this lady
Christophe Fournier,Beautiful American accent
Born free,south African accent well spoken English We should go after the Guptas Trump victory 2020 Trump has guts and is able to take on the crooked establishment. No doubt Trump will be victorious in 2020 You have no idea about American politics and the reptilian demonicrats Derek there is no comparison and you know it. Trump is winning Republicans are the silent majority as they were in 2016. The Demonicrats are unbelievably crooked and this Investigation will turn on their heads and expose their Quid Quo Pro in 2016. QUESTUS QUIDEM.. Trump will get them and expose them . Rubbish what rot Watch some real news CNN are paid to spread the false narrative Bill Barr has appointed Durham and he is investigating these matters. The Demonicrats are terrified of the truth and are desperately trying to impeach Trump so they can stop his investigation in 2016 No there is no comparison at all. Derek.. you will see in 2020 You are dissapointed in Trump because he refuses to give handouts to corrupt governments "We should put this country First and not Mozambique Yes Eskom is a charitable organization it also supplies Mozambique and Zimbabwe We hope so.. Martin Grace Mugabe.. where is the tart now?
Jesus Christ,amazing

Derek Main,@Bedazzled Quite a fitting name for an ANC member. "Trump is going to hear these words soon: ""YOU'RE FIRED!!!"" ü§£" The biggest threat the world faces today is the rogue state of america. Especially with someone as unstable as Trump being in charge of nuclear weapons. "@Danie Nilsen If you have something worth commenting on to say @Danie Nilsen Not worth it - learn to debate. @Danie Nilsen So lame - how old are you? @Danie Nilsen You can't even spell intellect ü§£ @Buyani Mhlongo I refuse to keep quiet when anyone sings Trump's praises. @Buyani Mhlongo About what? @Buyani Mhlongo Where did I say that? @Simon Davies Great! @Thando Nkutha Exactly - Trump is KKK. @Hamza You're wasting your time - that's like trying to get the truth out of Trump. @Hamza Yes - America have their own Zuma to deal with. @Born free ü§£ You've bought the BS hook-line-and-sinker. How can you oppose Zuma and support Trump? - they are the same. "@Born free If I didn't think there was @Born free Have you got small hands? ü§£ @Mikey Likesit All politicians are corrupt but Trump and Zuma have perfected it. """Donald Trump - you're fired!"" ü§£" @Hamza None so blind as those who do not want to see. @Born free I said all I have to say on that subject. "@Kapn Krunch Considering the close relationship between the ANC and ZANU-PF @Mikey Likesit Me too - they have suffered too much with no end in sight. "@Heather Cotton Of course @Danie Nilsen Partially but the elections have been stolen a few times already. Definitely not free and fair despite what our government said.

Volume pleeeeeaaaase. 1million for amabele. 1million for amabele or oats. Is goat your name or surname? Mr Prestorius is Somizi-ish. "Thando Nkutha Paul Buchel who told you we are not listening?

Hamza,"Strategic Marketing Dept advertised special programmes. Eg The bulb swap programme (you could swap your normal bulb for efficiency bulbs) It is a valid and necessary function The problem is the corruption which occured "I myself "The CIA said that they killed him ""in spite"" of Trump not because of Trump. They said Trumps actions in the past few weeks made the job harder and dangerous.Almost as if he didn't want him killed." "Anyways Those were soldiers already captured and in Prison. Trump let them go. Well the CIA and Military killed him not Trump. Trump was actually playing golf at the time. When Osama was killed at least Obama was in the control room. @Jabu Malinga Islam is the second biggest religion in the world. There are Billions of muslims in the world. You are judging billions of people because of a few kids. @Derek Main Theres no way the military and the CIA gave him real nuclear codes. They know he is not capable of that responsibility. "@Neil Fraser He is not a puppet of the white house. He 100% control the white house and the executive. However The millitary and CIA are seperate from the white house adn @Buyani Mhlongo Then who was it? The CIA obtained and confirmed the info (from the kurds and Turkey) then the Military carried out the operation. Trump wasn't even invited to watch in the control room @Danie Nilsen Trump was seen out playing gold at 3:30. Bagdadi was killed at 3. How was he middway through a golf game and in the control room at the same time???? @Danie Nilsen Theres also tons of evidence to suggest that the picture of him in the control room was staged. The ethernet cables aren't even plugged in. @dANE @Danie Nilsen You're the same as Zuma supporters who defend him even when all the evidence shows otherwise. Exactly the same. This just shows the idiocy has no race. "Even the evasion tactics employed by trump are similar to Zuma's. The 'Whataboutism' "@Mikey Likesit What president has made over 13 Exactly like Zuma supporters Same whatsapp group @Mikey Likesit and all of them should be considered as bad presidents shpul @Mikey Likesit I think he's referring to Trump. Did you guys know that Trumps dad financially supported the KKK and was actually arrested at one of their rallies? "Oh i guess we can just say that the Guptas and Zuma are innocent of corruption @Born free Trump is the establishment. His head of education supports cuts to public schools. Trump won't even get the nomination from his party. Are you even following the impeachment proceedings? His own party is turning away from him because they can't disagree with the facts. "@Born free Yes i do. My opinion is that they democrats are corrupt clowns. However Republicans didn't even win the majority vote in 2016??? They received less votes than Democrats. They won due to the undemocratic electorate college. You obviously don't know the facts of what you are speaking about. They weren't even the majority in 2016 and that number has extremely declined since 2016. @Born free and Fox?? They are imparital? The same Fox that supported Bush when he lied about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction? (He has admitted this so don't try and deny it) The same fox which Trumps ex press secretary works? Do you not see the conflict of interest / break of the seperation of powers? Do you not see how that is similar if not worse than Zuma and ANN7? I'm sorry but then you are an idiot. I guarantee you Zuma will say the exact same thing when on the stand about him and ANN7. @Pastor J Thats fair.
Arnie Naidoo,why on earth would Eskom need to advertise. They are the only service provider and electricity is an absolute need amongst all South Africans. marketing 101 lesson given hey we have not been consulted nor were there any contracts entered into seeing that we have sponsored Eskom for years with bailouts chair i need protection from the live chat Teabreak I'll have 2 sugars please.
