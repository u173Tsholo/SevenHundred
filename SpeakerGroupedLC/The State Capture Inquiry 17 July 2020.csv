Thabo Maake,"I‚Äôve always contended that the Auditor General of SA‚Äôs audit methodology is the most technically advanced. Just compare the evidence as led for SAA audit All material SAA findings were raised after the AG took over. Private firms need to raise their bar and stop hiding behind their names & size.
Vish Govender,"Auditors are the ""police""for financial misdemeanour acts. These guys are just like SAPS and they behave in the same way. With impunity???" "Miss Hofmeyer is brilliant. An advocate of note. Sharp

Mni Nkukwana,we have all the state organs to fight corruption in this country but how did we get here honestly!! now we're spending millions on this commission. this i we still have credible politicians in this country but they are being sidelined so that the looters can play their game freely.
Marcus Mmola,"Implement the regulatory laws and stop fussing Who audited the gentleman`s mental capacity. at last.

dean ribaudo,sad times for SA how many South Africans then multiply X 1000000 = 60 million X by 1 million equals I did not say that some said 1 mill to each person ja SA is not going well just seems like corruption in every department on gov if we steal or are corrupt we go to jail same should apply to all South Africans and guess what some of your tax paying money going down the drain on this because nothing going to happen after all this crazy show at your expense sorry our lol

S Schnaar,"@ seelan if they gave each citizen 1billion each they would have had more than  @ dean who's math we have 60 million people in this country imssyimg they could have given each person 1billion and still had billions why only 1 million each "we have almost 60 million citizens with 500 billion why must we get 1 we would have jacked our economy up big time. whereas now its all gone and nothing changed
Helen Terry,He is really battling its smacks of lies yes thats the sad truth. Eastern Cape is in a total mess health dept is incompetent but spent millions on motor bikes with side cars which could have gone towards cleaning up the hospitals everyone to do with SAA battle with making themselves clear will they ever get to the truth in Eastern Cape certainly. we lost the battle long ago...25 years in and its a total shambles. errrr errr ummm ummm blah blah ...just tell the truth and face the consequences..UBUNTU i guarantee after all this money spent no outcome will be forthcoming... pity we cant have a drink while we are watching üôÇ @Mang where does that leave the minorities of SA if the EFF take over??

Easy D,You're more than a disappointment not only as an auditor but to the entire country.. by simply overlooking inaccuracies of that magnitude is call fraud..all your personal assets should be seize ..
Makhosazana Tsotetsi,All the looters don't have answers for their shenanigans Whether Ms Hofmeyer has taken a view its immaterial
magabudla KaMphikeleli,Kanjani DD... Mev Hofmeyer should focus on understanding what transpired at SAA not at making the Auditor look incompetent
