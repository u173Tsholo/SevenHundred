GB,Greetings fellow citizens @mvubu1234 ...very eloquently stated 🙂 we hope for a roast well done hope that Adv Myburgh has his ducks in a row for this one what a long sermon.. eish @Kagiso Mathole true words on the back foot already... after a few hours of this - will he still be so full of it? go to the facts Adv M anger and irritation will not serve you smug fellow argumentative witness lots to say some serious consternation on the part of the witness.......being tied up in knots .....when you lie.... witness is cornered pressure being piled on.. careful now... begging attitude now ---mercy all innocence now... ' I don't know anything...' will not help you faced with decision as to whether to throw Mkhwanazi under the bus...eish! punchdrunk changing the subject... ...careful with ' I can't remember ' India! omw later later @Kgotso Mohale....totally false report?... lol @GODFREY MALOMA nightmare shot! @Bongiwe Moeli "'let me 'balance' you  Chair is not satisfied with this cop out is he presuming to lecture DCJ? lol @Singi Mathebula 'socialize'....

The falling out of the thieves. Lekker! Very senior person - if I may say so.. when the crooks start turning on each other... what a takedown... cornered! getting worse and worse for him. again brother suspicious whn you have clear recall on certain things but not others - red flag why impossible? orange onesie - medium size have some water baba ...on national TV.

A lot was at play here🤥 Myburgh and Mahlangu Square Up and DCJ has to separate the fight Where are the phone records? I’m listening and watching carefully here. It’s important not to draw conclusions too quickly🤔 "Little do people know when they take an advisory role in government. Mahlangu was hardly there Eddie😂😂 Mkhwanazi doesn’t remember Mapoma telling him about Mahlangu’s call. Mahlangu doesn’t recall putting pressure on Mapoma. What!!! a Gupta on his stoep🤥 "DCJ finally Important point he made about Bowman being associated with the old leadership of Maria Ramos and board🤔. The 25 page report stood no chance. "Why would Mr Mapoma make this up "Mapoma "Maybe it was Friday "Mr Mapoma "Give him time He can’t remember cause he wants DCJ’s job so he won’t ruin it by agreeing to such a career limiting travesty Were you in the habit of calling him prior?

Vandag sal die poppe dans😂 @Peter Prentice . He is lying. There is no independent recollection! I saw a pic of him and the President on my twitter line yesterday. He was obviously close to No. 1!

All these dodgy witnesses come with a Mbanjwa in tow🤣 He can't recall important facts! uBaba thought that this was a 'rising star' that was going to make things happen for him! He seems close to tears He is intelligent @David Tuer . Problem is he is compromised What made him leave private practice? There was defintely an Agenda to bring him in "While Zuma is refusing to come to the commission @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee . He attracts drama big time because he is too greedy for positions of power DCJ is warming up. I fear for this witness when he is ready @John Batwell Witness has become subdued🤐 @Blake Yogi . Maybe he needs his tea to warm him up India!!!!!!! "Mbalula told us .....once you eat the curry
Mzalwane Mzala,Make a serious attempt at correctly pronouncing people's names Heita @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee "@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee I am not an EFF member but Molo @Yolo More @MOLLY PHUNGULA Please educate me on why this commission's existence is due to the EFF @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee The commission did not emanate from the court process. It was one of the public protector's remedial actions. @Elvis Malakoane It was said that this will end before lunch. I now believe that. SONA was never stopped @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee. All the SONAs continued after a bit of disruption. This commission gets information/ documents that you have forgotten about and they confront with it. Malema also? @Pardon Tshepo 😀😀 Throwing Mkwanazi under the bus. The lie that there will be no prosecutions has been exposed by the arrests of a number of people who testified in this commission @Anne M. The lie that no prosecutions will emanate from the existence and work of the State Capture Commission @Anne M. Investigations by any section of the commission is there because of the existence and work of the commission.

Umar Singh,Crook in training Most of witnesses at this Commission have tried their best to protect others including big fishes. Not incriminating others lest they fear for their own well being DENYING EVERYTHING. Wait for NPA to pounce. This guy fears for his life He made his statement. Now Myburg will prove he is lying. He will then change statement. He was the conduit from higher up. Will he undertake a lie detecter test. Wearing same suit as Laher yesterday This guy must have done his majors ( Subject) in Corruption Issues He should be given a bathroom break to change underwear
Magesh Difa,I see flames today gigaba s life is just a mess he created I feel sorry for those politicians who get protection from bushiri he is jail he also cannot protect himself. kuzoshuba he wants to commit suicide with that tie. they must watch him he is protecting the masters. watch the space

Maxwell Sibiya,Morning. Who we having today? Why is he reading us a story? What happened to asking questions and giving answers. What is the Novel all about? All of you might not be reading this correctly. I don't think he is protecting Gigaba. His simply protecting his career beyond commission. He doesn't sound like his denying wrongs. Opinion
Heather Durr,Morning all-isnt he just perfect This is a lawyers use of the English language Arrogance will be his downfall-Myburgh is way more accomplished than him as an attorney-he needs to tell the truth and know his place And we have a knew word 'triggers'..... *new 'physical phone call' as opposed to what heavenly phone call "Myburgh has no respect for anyone educated 'Chopping list' Myburghs victims Whaaaaaaat 'tread carefully' Use Mt Lahers locomotive to take you back to the past in yen currency @Paulo Da Costa Meerlust Cabernet or my favourite Meerlust Merlot I n know...nonono I dint know yes but nonono @dominic mabe hey who you calling skelm OUCH OUCH OUCH Gotcha Everything has sub-paragraphs LOOOOOOL Slap from Myburgh 'Before you jump in You are soooooooo dead New Words-'Memory Lapse' Eyeball to Eye ball'😂😂😂😂 @Kebalipile Jacobs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 What................................ "WHY WHY WHY DCJ Did you tell him the evidence of Mkwanazi . Thats it. One witness gave false evidence DCJ throwing lifeline AGAIN DCJ Did you rally have to let him out of jail. They cant touch him now DCJ JUST SHUT UP WHAT ARE YOU DOING
Pheladi Lamola,Did he write this himself or what? "Because of the implications of lying under oath "For control He banna He's still arrogant "I know that everytime DCJ starts a sentence with ""you see""... then stuff is about to hit the fan" 😲😲😲 Can't they get phone records once and for all? Except we know how the likes if you act like when you're in a position of power Mr Mahlangu. That someone is older than you doesn't even cross your mind. @Naledi Barron I'm scared of those two words from the DCJ
Ayjay York,@siya remember your record of chastising an executive at SAA? your record is in the domain "@siya your arrogance will be your downfall he was the former special advisor to gigba dont cry siya your tone seems to be seeking sympathy from chair "siya do not protect gigaba bro @siya whisky shot would do "@sundaytimes once ran an article about siya calling an executive at SAA chastising him why he admitted that siya had called him rearding denel & SAA...siya

Nash Shongwe,"Mr. Mahlangu has mastered the politicians art of Angazi My statement chair is Angazi 😀😀😀 No chair I’m not aware 😀😀😀
P T,People dont seem to understand that this type of questioning by Myburgh is actually out of li e the context of a Commission of Inquiry. A hostile inquiry with condescending tones is akin to a trial @Rahab probing is never meant to dismiss or rubbish an alternative set of facts the witness gives. Myburgh says they draw an inference & when he says no hes told we dont care abt your inference @Rahab thats true. I actually feel that the commission has made up its mknd that Mahlangu is a hostile witness based on previous testimony but from what he is saying seems he is a small fish. @Rahab Seems to avoid implicating Gigaba Mr Mkhwanazi seems to have laid all issue at Mahlangus feet to avoid implicating Gigaba and Zuma.
Mike S,And this Mahlangu guy is supposed to be a Lawyer? SMDH 🙂 So this guy is currently a Top Exec at Telkom?

Johannes Venter,Myburgh is effective - he is locking the guy into his lies. Mahlangu is lying. Mahlangu gets angry about the questions.
