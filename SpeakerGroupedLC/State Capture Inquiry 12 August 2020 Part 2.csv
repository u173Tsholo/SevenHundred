Koketso Tlhabi,I vote ANC. It is my choice. Much as you vote for a party of your choice. I definitely would not vote for the DA. It is way too early to reinstate apartheid. The woulds are still fresh. I dont condone corruption and i believe ANC will sort this out and we move on.
Tumi Masuku,if only they had better lies
TW Ntshingila,TK which party would you recommend as a viable alternative to the ANC?
Samuel Skosana,All parties become corrupt when in power. We should rather have a system where we vote for individuals instead of parties. Why don't we get rid of the party political system???
Lennon Marks,coming in on the blind. it is not the voting but it is a case of educating the masses so that they can make the right choices corruption is not a case of education except maybe Zuma but it's a case of morals.

L. M,@Canis Africanis your quote is unfounded as i have researched now. Do not fabricate. The ANC is in charge! "@Dominic Przybylski in this chat somebody was asked of the alternative @Dominic Przybylski there you dont say about political ideology "even if the government is reduced @Dominic Przybylski e.g anywhere in the world? in south-est asia the politicians are rife in leadership that run the life of people through their governments election are held periodically and the politicians are voted by the people and they are concerned about their leaders

Dominic Przybylski,Anyone who believes politicians will solve their problems have not yet learned enough about life. @L.M Alternative to democracy? "An alternative is to reduce the reach of government into our personal life. It's an aim leading to a process ... problems have already conceded defeat. They lack self-esteem and those are the people who feed politicians. "Yes but the politicians will be weaker and the people will be stronger. The people will have more pride in themselves Thailand has had lowest unemployment anywhere in the world for decades. Why? Because they don't get any government support. They can look after themselves. It's called the land of smiles. They don't expect their government to do anything for them so the politicians have no power over them. When people believe politicians will do things for them is when they lose power.
