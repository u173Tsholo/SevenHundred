Siziwe Khalatha,"I like this woman they should read them as Volume 1 Issue 1 etc
Muriel Haynes,what is ms is this still escom yesterday was shocking revelation
Blaze 613,"no one is been investigated by anyone
Mzalwane Mzala,I like her confidence @Siziwe Khalatha I hold no brief for this PP but I am disgusted by the double standards displayed by some South Africans. No one is above investigation. The review process is available to challenge reports. Anyone who insists on telling the PP who to investigate and not investigate has no respect for the independence of that office. You can not argue against abuse while you insist on breaking the law. @Jack Sparrow Is it acceptable to curtail her independence with regard to whom she can investigate? @Jack Sparrow You are fdisplaying independence. lol @Jack Sparrow You are being objective and fair. Lol The court has made a finding on that and she was wrong. That has nothing to do with other investigations. The self-righteous only likes the law and legal process when it favors them. They don't care about that "'The DA election strategists (ironically most of them white) concluded that if they could crush me publicly "'This is not a conspiracy theory. I have a document that was circulated to the Federal Executive "'I was suspended "'The DA even found a donor to generously sponsor their strategy. If I disappeared "'When I politely declined to resign as premier and leave the country Pauli Van Wyk @Thando Nkutha The article is under he byline in Daily Maverick Writen by her "‚ÄòCruising nicely‚Äô on VBS: EFF‚Äôs Parties I just copied and pasted @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Cool
Ben Hashem,We need to get a president with a rainbow heart. No matter the skin color. The corruption is destroying our nation.
makhosi nobhatyi,@Madelein Huxtable I am watching this procedures and breaking news about revelations of Gordhan issued by PP is damaging President in cleaning up. But we wish Gordhan not be included in the cabinet "Gordhan must challenge this outcome if he feels not happy with @ Mzalwana mzala I think what is disturbing us PP two reports already proven by was wrong so I am not saying Gordhan is above the law we are supporting him to take report to the review and declined Appointment
welton paulse,"Mara whats going on here
nicky abrahams,Housekeeping.....
Dan Brown,SABC Mixer Monster Drunk again. Amateurs. It's a sound Mixer not a Cray Super Computer. FFS
Lorna Kavanagh,Gordhan is going to challenge PP report This PP is going after the wrong people..... there are plenty criminals in high office who need to be investigated. She would be more credible if she investigated Brian Molefe .... Billions have been looted from this country and she would serve SA better by investigating more ofthe implicated people.. .... and just look at Eskoms debt alone .. Zuma appointee... so true
Derek Main,@Lorna Kavanagh Yeah - it seems she has an agenda. The PP seems to be part of the state capture project. Thank goodness the state capture report was already done before Thuli left - we may never have had this commission otherwise. @Wilson Hishono Yep - Zuma tried to squash it. Now we know why. The very rich ones are headed to Dubai. This is the nuts and bolts of the evidence. Molefe's emails etc. The PP is a very important institution - agreed. But do you feel protected by the current PP? "Yes - in this particular case but for the long term I definitely don't feel she is looking after my interests. We seen that game played by politicians forever. I'm tired of that. Legal processes take too long. It's just that the PP has been slapped down a few times and doesn't seem to be tackling the priority issues. That's what I'm saying - not mine. Yes - gave him early retirement and then re-employed him. "Yes - I agree but PG can be investigated like any of us. If he was wrong @Thando Nkutha Let's see what explanation he has for that. @Thando Nkutha You can be guaranteed some serious spinning. That or some other lame excuse.
Felix Muyoba,@Lorna Kavanagh but your version seems to be biased to gordham..why dont you leave the PP to do its job? imagine if someone you dont like..am sure you could be supporting the PP @Lorna Kavanagh @Mzalwane Mzala exactly thats my point!
Thuto Che' M,We are living in interesting times! The show of character will be how DPP responds and prosecute those found wanting...
Wildthing,Mzala I agree. but they should be targeting the once with the most zeros behind the corruption first then work down. Pravin has proven he is good at busting up corruption but is not 100% innocent and before people jump on the Stienhoff case. I invested even if not a lot it still money so yes I am waiting for that case in court to. nothing to do with white or black. it was an international scam as a Tax payer people have a right. it's there money been lost to criminals her report on the Cow farm was so shocking it could have been done by a 15 year old how could she leave Ace out of the cow farm. if you can answer that in a fair way then I will respect you and your opinion is it not SARS internal lawyers and managements role to investigate the Pravin case and take actions. HR must take some blame too if it was illegal action. SAA has lost millions and she has done ?
Jack Sparrow,@Mzalwane Mzala Yet the pp is displaying a shocking abuse of power the pp is playing politics. it's not acceptable. @Mzalwane Mzala she's not displaying independence "I agree the law must take its course c'mon. two reports on the eve of a cabinet announcement? Both in haste? GAL. @Derek Main she's certainly not harming it @Lorna Kavanagh or any of the many people implicated in this commission The current PP is not no my side According to the law: ‚ÄúOn what basis she could justifiably come to such a conclusion is unclear. It points either to ineptitude or gross negligence in the execution of her duties.‚Äù @Derek Main c'mon. exonerating mabusa is surely a priority issue for some the problem is whose issues is she prioritising @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU you were talking sense until you went all stupid racist @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU apologies - you're still talking sense üòÉ
Anne M.,"The next PP might be another Thuli @Wilson Hishono Agree. My understanding is that the Guptas are in Dubai and the NDPP has set things in motion regarding extradition.
Born free,The witness is dressed for the Oscar's.. love the bowtie.. üòÇ Yes but non of them are politicians
Cassius Mngomezulu,No EFF Appointee
Wilson Hishono,very true Zuma sat on it... I think the chronies want to flee south africa but where to ? SA needs to strengthen bilateral agreements on extradition of suspects especially from DUBAI ...where are the GUPTAS Hiding anyway?
KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"Jeez "@michaelwild You correct "@Singi Mathebula Contet? Whta you basing this from? Did i mention ""content?"" or you just want to vent anger nje" "@Singi Mathebula Am not here to be dragged into a pigsty. Please "@Singi Mathebula Stop this pious act of pandering into this ""online"" pigsty kind of tussle. I am always sober and i am not here to be engaged on this kind senseless discourse." "@Singi Mathebula Are the ladies with makeup presenting ""content""? You're deluded wena" "@Singi Mathebula Anyway @makhosi nobhatyi Concure with you.... @makhosi nobhatyi Concur with you @makhosi nobhatyi This PP is a mess. We don't need this rot in the midst of our country's tumultuous state Lets not forget that Zuma and Shaun Abrahams use the very same tactics to bring Pravin down! This is a total witch-hunt. Why this PP exonerates ACE Magashule from that Free State Dairy project? Zuma and Shaun Abrahams used the very same witch hunt tactics.... lets not forget @Derek Main "@Derek Main Yes "@Thando Nkutha You saw that bank statement? THEY WILL BLAME ""WHITE MEDIA.""" @Kevin Allister Simon Lets blame white media for these startling but not so perturbing revelations to some. "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU You can expert them (EFF) to claim ""white media"" tactics to tarnish their name. Just wait!" @Jack Sparrow LOL "@Jack Sparrow You don't get me.... i am quoting "Oops...... this was meant for you @Kevin Allister Simon ....You can expert them (EFF) to claim ""white media"" tactics to tarnish their name. Just wait!" @Jack Sparrow Thanks LOL There is a lot behind this EFF and VBS matter. I knew it! @Jack Sparrow It appears VBS was the red beret piggy bank. Hence they wear a R26000 worth pair of Italian shoes. Jeez! "@Thando Nkutha In media as a business Doesn't work like that "Media is a business.... and journalists have been working on that story "@Thando Nkutha Remember the media's bottom line also "@Thando Nkutha I read you imply it is wrong "Media as a business @Thando Nkutha Okay i get "Media landscape is in tumultuous state "@Thando Nkutha for media workers "Thats also another advantage... the more certain journalists of a particular media firm have rich contacts "I mean Thando "Sometimes She's a freelancer for them Met her couple of times here in Cape Town "Facilitated honours student with her as well Where is Maleka? @Mzalwane Mzala Under byline?? You mean ? oH you mean she in the byline "@Mzalwane Mzala sorry There is more to come regarding VBS....i said so last month VBS= EFF piggy bank Is Maleka done with the commission or is on leave?
Singi Mathebula,@keith what has the content to do with makeup? sexism! i am referring to what is being presented . i am not angry. why should i ? @ i suspect you are an eff memberü§£
clive oconnell,If only ANC parachuted management could devote their skills to growing the country not stealing its assets.
Kevin Simon,Also keeping an eye on the EFF -VBS matter unfolding. Multitasking.
Granny Mokwena,and now have they found Gordan's bank account yet in Canada? üòÇ
