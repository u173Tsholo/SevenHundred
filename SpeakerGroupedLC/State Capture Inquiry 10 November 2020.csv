Heather Durr,Hi @ALTA @ALTA Everyone is ignoring me today @Pastor J.J Yes-thank you We have a vaccine @Gert @Cassandra DCJ cant rule as it is sub-judice @Cassandra Cronje In time a court will be allocated to hear bail. She needs to get a lawyer first as the charge sheet will say what time she has to appear and in what court Vaccine for COVID 90% effective @Blake Yogi I doubt she will be in jail-it is not an offence that requires incarceration-but as a formality they must place everyone on record and set the date for hearing. They may need a High Court That tie .......................... Its back-starting from the beginning @ALTA Hi @ALTA Is it only Mr Peach giving evidence today @Tommygun I think what many whites dont understand is that our black population would rather vote for a black gov with a history of corruption rather than a White who represents horror of apartheid @Rene Ngwenya I think that the concept of BEE was not properly thought thru. As black professionals would jump from one company to the next if offered more. It cost fortunes to keep them TEA TIME-We have meandered on this path too long @Naledi Barron Hi there what an unpleasant chat stream This Mr Kennedy has no direct line of questioning-I dont know where he is going-all these arbitrary questions. He needs structure. Is the witness a accused if so give us a hint for g*ds sake He had to go so they could put a Guptaclone in *commenth Here we go ....................................... As I am sitting here today In hindsight............................................................................ @Louis C @ALTA It was not a small thing Louis-it was disgusting BOOM K*k Jou Moer jy lieg What does this have to do with him being disciplined @rene VRS was owned by Guptas-So I unlike you view all corruption pretty much the same LUNCH TIME.

Aubrey De Bliquy,@ALTA GM Hello @Heather Durr Just say I am very flattered by this highly co-ordinated effort to ignore me. LOL GM @Pastor J.J Morning @SCliff N22 Hi @PAT WILSON Just say I am very flattered by this highly co-ordinated campaign to ignore me. HAHAHA @zip reeper Gelukkig het ek nie die vaagste benul daaroor maar LOL Morning @Valencia J Welcome to the elite group of real people with a name and a pic. 😀 Hi @Megan Diedericks morning @JOHANNES MOSELANYANA @Valencia J Yes like I said few have an actual pic and name. Welcome Hmmm @Valencia J I respect folk who prefer to be discret unless they abuse their privacy to say things they are not prepared to defend. I just block people who just keep posting spam as it detrats from the conversation. Yes Piet Vast said ANC=starvation which is just political spam imho. I think this covid is a scam to hide the BIG RESET. They say they are ignoring the anual flu stats. i.e. if they are absorbing the figures into the covid stat to inflate their scam. "OK @Piet Vast I hear you blocked -1 X @Piet Vast Hey @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee thanks HOw r u today? OK @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee thanks. Just hoping business picks up soon. Lets see if CR is actually serious about fixing this. Corruption is a cancer that eats at the sould of a country. @ALTA I just nticed his crude comment which reflects poorly on him not you sis.
Pastor J.J,@ALTA @Heather Durr Can either of you see my chats? @zip reeper Morning my friend @ALTA...@Valencia J Please tell Teunis I greeted him twice thos morning. @ALTA She stopped ignoring me. hehehehehe @Sean - Is it really necessary to be so disrespectful to Coloured and Zulu People? Whos is acceptable to you in your opinion? And your apologies are so insincere. Stop man. @Teunis van Ree Who was the benefactor of that hit button? Let us know and we will follow @Teunis van Ree Great @zip reeper Always awake. @Teunis van Ree Was that not a James Hadley Chase title? I stand to be corrected @zip reeper I read it almost 50 years ago @Louis C It was so long ago I suspected that I could be horribly wrong @zip reeper I was obsessed and had the entire collection @zip reeper I never knew that. Well now I know I had a very small part of the collection. I surrender and admit my foolishness. hahahahahahah @Louis C I will thanks @zip reeper Indeed correct "@zip reeper I must admit that I had not read any of Creaseys books but I assure you I will look at it. But
Blake Yogi,Who remembers how Kate was crying when the application was brought to conceal his identity @Gert that ruling is what we are all waiting for. 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ @Itumeleng. I agree. Also to dig up the rot of all SOEs over the years is going to cost. But guess what. the corruption combined is worth way more. Denel and jackets 🙈🙈 @Teunis: Op my nugter maag "DCJ had to make a decision to give an instruction for the commission to lay a charge so the situation can go to court @Sibu u aint gonna hear Kate anytime soon. this week is Denel @Goran the issue the guys had was teachers supporting those functions. Schools should not participate in such things. "Had there been no teachers there @Tommy amen @Phaka sad you dont see how the 2 are interlinked @Sean dont generalize.
PAT WILSON,now you know what it is like to be ignored. simply because you have been pre judged by whose standards l attempted to interact on numerous occasions but l do not need acceptance disgusting indeed!!!
Joy Smith's,we are ready
Itumeleng Maletswa,why should people be consent about costs of Zondo commission as compared to how much haynas took..anyway Morning black out...eskom maybe "if they can call all bosses involved in this matter..ask them questions on this matter
Marius Strydom,More more. Hoop daars aksie vandag 👍 Dis net koel hier ek eet ook mango🤔
Goran Djocik,morning what time does the commission start today? Dudu is in polsmoor prison did zondo oversleep this morning? I thought it would start at 10am @ ? the matric farewell was a private function and not the school. @Mzala no that not what I said. i said they had no business to go there. EFF just course trouble where they go. same as the PE incident with clicks. Remember the most whites in this country is gatvol @ Mazala SA is no different from Zimbabwe @ Johan lol not sure what you referring to @minnie @Minnib it's the same if you have a private party at your house. Surely you can invite who ever you want to. it's not an open street party

Who is this fellow & what is/was his role at Denel?Have not heard yet @SanFran Arnold Thanks @Sihle Mbatha Cannot always stop “private” race based parties. It happens in most places of work.

"@Goran Djocik Nah @Blake Yogi My fingers are crossed... "@Phakamile Khuzwayo spot on @Heather Durr I could be wrong but I suspect some voters think that aprtheid could come back with a white government.

Sean -,DA is a racist party. Lol those boers moered EFF memebers😆😆😆😆 Heard the boer that was moering EFF members is only 17 years old😆😆😆 @Tommygun - true that ! What happened yesterday just shows that coloured are against blacks. @Anwar Syed - DA is going to lose votes significantly trust me. Coloureds are siding with racist DA😑 Coloureds are sell out. Lol but that boer that moered EFF members 😆😆😆😆 An example of coloureds being sell outs is Trevor Noah. @Mfundo - His picture his all over EFF twitter. They want to kill him😆 @Matthew Van wyk - Isn't Trevor Noah a sell out though? Most coloureds don't even have tertiary qualifications 😴 @Mfundo - THEY ARE making threats on Twitter though😃 @SanFran Arnold - I am sorry.. I said I am sorry guys. I said most though not all.. I am coloured😕 @Mfundo - No but you can't deny that coloureds are generally violent people. @Mfundo - Zulus are both uneducated nd violent just like coloureds. @Naledi Barron - Sorry mam @Mfundo - LOL bro Zulus are also uncircumcised so😴😴😴😴 @Pastor J. J - I didn't mean to I apologise. But wasn't the outsurance guy married to a coloured woman? 😦 @Rene Ngwenya - But when Trevor Noah says kallit women are dangerous ..nothing gets done to him. Dude very few coloureds have matric qualifications. Coloureds are our Mexicans in South Africa. Lol "Let us take the outsurance case as an example. Based on what you saw guys and be honest The Katlego guy was held at knife point in that clip. @Naledi Barron - I like your English ☺ @Naledi Barron - I wanna speak English like you one day. @Naledi Barron - I will.

Hi @Naledi Barron 😘 @ALTA How long did you work with him? @Esme Erwee @R A South Africa has poor whistle blower measures in place. And I am tired of honest whistle blowers being called snitches etc. Normally we should be able to report the matter to the Public Protector @R A . Not so sure with the current PP. Other option is to go to the press. We have some fine investigative journalists in SA @Riaan Venter . It's a matter of choosing the right ones.
