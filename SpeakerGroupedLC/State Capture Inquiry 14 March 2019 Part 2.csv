Lew464,SABC censorship at work this guy is ducking and diving. South Africans NOT forgiving? Forgive what? The whole ANC is corrupt. Has been from beginning. Why forgive? nobody visits Guptas for casual chats. There are ALWAYS motives. Money number 1. SABC censorship at work. "liar pop in for tea. I've got your money! do a financial forensic. Check for deposits into his accounts after Gupta visits. "Thembinkosi Mbokazi​  easy to bribe!!! he can't spell OATH

Magda Seguin,VBS is the keyword for this witch hunt The letter the EFF sent to the Commission is in the public domain...it is very slanderous Nobody in politics can be trusted Lies and denials...The EFF wants everyone to believe they are squeaky clean The ANC is rotten to the core Future generations will judge the past 25 years as totally wasted starting with the arms deal @Monique...Nobody it seems 28% youth unemployment...a total disgrace Zuma is enjoying life...what a horror story spitting in the face of the poor and jobless I seem to be the only angry person...I am livid that our country was stolen Oh really?what conscious?? @Walton...I was in exile and my nationality taken away by the Apartheid government...I saw first hand how people died...some even committed suicide after fleei Look how our people still travel on overcrowded trains @Welton you are right...but will it happen unless SA's demand justice Excuses...being polite to the Guptas! Eish! He must just say outright he did Zumas bidding... Juju and his lieutenants is also tainted...same difference I really feel for Judge Zondo...I pray that he continue with strength I don't believe anything he says to ingratiate himself @Gabisile true These captured guys are maybe still in contact with the Guptas...who knows? They employed people with companies they bought with SA taxpayers money Same story as the DG who testified this morning who was told to resign in 20 minutes EFF is dangerous Yes @Michael...more stuff coming out on a daily basis...we will be more informed what to do Lifestyle audits...I see the EFF top guys wear R25k shoes and top shelf watches "The EFF is a quasi military outfit...why is Malema called CIC? They are racist What do you think the EFF will do with power? The EFF act like hooligans in parliament The EFF brainwash the weak I admire Judge Zondo...Been watching from the start and listened carefully to his questions Nene totally implicated himself today but he is still obfuscating He is trying to soft soap his actions...taking us for idiots I read today that whistleblowers are very scared as they fear death..everyone asks why didn't the honest one's say anything but they were paralysed with fear The political deaths in KZN and Mmpumalanga was never solved Jail is waiting boetie They committed treason You are tragic Sir...I hope you pay the price and go to jail Cry the beloved country...our ancestors are turning in their graves Spell it out Mr Pretorious...it must go down in history that a finance minister consisted with the Guptas *consorted I wish OUTA was an entity to vote for Organisation for Undoing Tax Abuse "People are without water and sanitation Hindsight is always 20:20 Do the right thing and never regret anything Joemat-Petterson is another rotten apple That fishing rights must be exposed here
