Val Speirs,"The "" practise"" was to enrich themselves. I don't believe any such "" Suppliers"" existed other than by fraudulent means and names." ANC UNMASKED No construction because there is no Supplier. "Money did not go to any "" Suppliers"" it went to the crooks in the department." The system worked as the MEC designed it..straight into false bank accounts. "I think from Part one this morning He is still fighting his dismissal with the CCMA all these years later. The Crooks of the powers that be in the ANC use others as their scapegoats and have gotten away with their crimes . This witness did nothing wrong Vote Forrest Gump Hawks and NPA were captured
Fred Desrosiers,"@Val Spiers they must get the bank transactions that the previous person testified about "wow "@Mr Green. it is too easy for those in government and their ""suppliers"" to steal." wow. this guy has no shame of what was done? "watching the State Capture proceedings gives me the view that SA government leaders are not held or may never be held accountable for billions lost into ""projects""" "@Jacqui Baumgart "@Doug.

In every society there is a level of corruption. But when it reaches a level where your economy crumbles and no money for development the sad part is the people that are suffering because of corruption are the ones that end up voting for those who are making them suffer the arms deal set up the blueprint for ensuing public sector corruption this is crime against humanity - our people dying because of asbestos - people dying of hunger no wonder countries like CHina and North Korea execute puplic officials for corruption CR is busy with presidential things and this is not one of his concerns
