Simphiwe Jobo,Deputy Chief Justice Zondo has been unduly delaying the progress of the Commission by his tortoise like grasp of the proceedings and his unwarranted role as the Chief evidence Leader.
Sibusiso Tshikovhi,Huh??? @Naledi Barron AMEN @Maboko S 🤣😂😅 @Sibusiso Cilo Hopefully they will be arrested after Yakhe Kwinana's hearings @Lwando Mjiwu True
James Ramonye,agree there are times where evidence leader mis some important evidence let's engage on the above because it's a lesson to us ✊ its premature to even think abount amnesty. honestly what informs that
Wayward,Agree DCJ Zondo RESPECT!!!
Lee D. Hendrix,...Zondo is the only representative of the people...... "...The Guptas were allowed to view the military arsenal of SA AND BREACH PROTOCOLS OF THE SECURITY SERVICES @GLOBALLY "...This old man is a washing machine for various types of money ".The power structure in Governments is designed from servitude Law is not taught to youth "The shares in Eskom are represented by other than SAfricans. Feeding monies to invisible persons is tax-prevention and organized crime against taxpayers "...Did education backfire or are these people bored ...Racism is a personal ignorance. ...If these guys are set free the prison gates should be opened and throw away the keys and the jailers.
Arthur Dell,agrred
Moses Sowage,@Naledi you are spot on DCJ is doing a great job
dominic mabe,zondo it's a anc member ♦️♦️ @joyce I agreed ♦️♦️ We must vote for eff♦️♦️❎

He is running away from the Hawks this one "@eliasmnisi72 remember the MKMVA he is addressing is the one lead by Kebby Maphatswe and Carl Niehaus Last kick of a dying horse
Jenny Whitewaves,Is it worse that these people acted against their own country and in many cases against those who voted for them. than the Guptas who took advantage of the greed of people in a country not their own I think the South Africans committed treason and the Guptas corruption and state capture "@Bandile Hadebe the war room is not a place it is the name given to a small group of high ups who were tasked with getting Escom back on track "Both Tsotsi and Ngubane are fighting for their lives Each is saying not me @Francis Idris while there are other 74 year olds living in shacks carrying water and wood for cooking he must spend the rest of his days in jail "If this leads to new laws maybe Thuli has 2 reasons 1 to encourage more whistlebowers 2 country stability for overseas investors help the economy Concerns about the instability Ace + EFF will bring if threatened by the law any MK vets Is this number 35 implicating JZ That's because he can't read the transcripts And we are supporting each one of them "@Ndamulelo Ndou Sorry rude to jump in but I think capture started as soon as the Nats realized ANC would win @Ndamulelo Ndou I hope that's a typo the ANC has never been honest either within the party or with anyone else Magashule is dangerous he will fan civil unrest to deflect from his own problems Ace is me first ANC a long way behind 2nd and the country and people non starters He is promising land Do all these guys want to be farmers or do they think it will be Sandton

Eddie Reddy,EFF Have a genuine economic path...vbs "is Salim Essa  "@ Richard  "@Bandile "dr Ben is lying Compensation will be demanded from the board members for the clandestine decision they have taken "Cdj is embarrassing dr Ben with his laughter
Bandile Hadebe,"Who is said ""businessman""???" Oh that makes sense. Businessman is everywhere @cassim makes sense. I think 🤔 I remember that now @Jenny Whitewave. Thank you 🙏 for the explanation
Brian,@ Russia. Quite rightly don't you think? what makes you think DJZ enjoys his job? "Is it just my imagination or is DJZ getting his ""hers and Hises"" mixed up?" "DJZ is actually saying ""all roads lead to Dubai""?"
Phillip Van Rensburg,businessman was the gupta guys an SOE communicating with such an email asif they are discussing R2 hiding oversees he is a thug forgetting the marriage 🤣 its a term used in business i wonder if the guptas and co is even watching im sure they are Tsotsi's all of you for what it worth probably was @Naledi Barron 🤣
Gabisile Mabuza,"@Bandile ""businessman"" is Salim Essa."
Francis Idris,I remember Dr Ngobane once saying to a portfolio committee he can not fly economy. Business class or nothing how can someone be called Tsotsi and be given such a huge responsibility? Mr Tsotsi is a real tsotsi This is a lesson to all of us! what you today may follow you in a few years ahead For Eskom to survive this barrage of corrupt activities Dr Ngubane is finished how old is this guy? How many years can he serve in prison? he is 74 Mbalula was spitting fire "I don't want to sound a racist or anything! Be careful when you have friends with names like Gupta @Bongumenzi Nxumalo its because I have lots of similarities page 353 🤣🤣
Cooler Cat,mbalula referred to Carl Niehous and the veterans as the SG group who still struggle to accept the Nasrec.😂😂 "@jwarha21 Yes he was "@Sam Monkoe "@Derek "@Mpho Khoza I I still don't understand why Jacob Zuma and his supporters think he be exempted from answering questions at the commission if everyone mentioned are doing it? Is he suppose to be treated special? Too much laughter from DCJ today "@Mpho Khoza Ace You see now he spoke about Mbalula but he's not saying anything about the threat of making the country governable by the veterans This Ace is such a disgruntled character. So he mention all the top leaders except his President
Heather Durr,@cassim suleman You speak the truth. Those brains are dazzling @cassim suleman she drives very quickly around those curves. People must beware @cassim suleman She is truly formidable and fearless @Andy Ms Mbanjwa should have her own reality show. I was howling with laughter-I do hope we see her again even on the witness stand Did you see #AdvGerrieNel representing the first accused at the bail application of the 3 policemen accused in the Julies case. Gerrie Nel would have fun here @cassim suleman So that is where he is. Maybe he earns more money there "HELP: Is this guy going to jail or is he giving evidence so that someone else goes to jail. This all sounds so familiar @thembisa odendaal I agree totally. Pretorius can be condescending unlike meyer who I think scares him and Seleka who he goes drinking with 😇 *Hofmeyer 'He waxes warm and then cold' He studied English Literature it seems 'Dont lose your train of thought Mr Seleka'.DCJ interrupts and then takes over the floor
Anovuyo Cebe,Why is Dr. Ngubane alwsys forgetting How can replaces a suspended with a suspended #Eskom is a circus DR NGUNANE THOUGH 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Dr. Ngubane should just change his surname to Tsitsi 😂😂 So he answered Chief Justice even before he asks @Simba Chisanhu 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
