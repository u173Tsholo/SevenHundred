Lee D. Hendrix,...Zondo is the only representative of the people...... "...The Guptas were allowed to view the military arsenal of SA AND BREACH PROTOCOLS OF THE SECURITY SERVICES @GLOBALLY "...This old man is a washing machine for various types of money ".The power structure in Governments is designed from servitude Law is not taught to youth "The shares in Eskom are represented by other than SAfricans. Feeding monies to invisible persons is tax-prevention and organized crime against taxpayers "...Did education backfire or are these people bored ...Racism is a personal ignorance. ...If these guys are set free the prison gates should be opened and throw away the keys and the jailers.

Nonsense! I wake up everyday to be a productive member of society and pay taxes so these people can brazenly steal my money And if you grant amnesty what are you saying to the citizens about accountability? They must go to jail! Ordinary citizens go to jail so why shouldn't they? They must rot in jail!
