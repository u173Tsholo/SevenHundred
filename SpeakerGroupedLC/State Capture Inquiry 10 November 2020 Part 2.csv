It only functions when open. @Aubrey De Bliquy xx "@FieliesSA Ace was attempting to find an international ""voice"" by making statements regarding the U.S election. Problem is "@Valencia J There are many with very fixed P.O.Vs @FieliesSA I wouldn't put anything past Ace! @Smart Guys Yes. Interesting days....... Agree @Valencia J. You'll get no argument from me! @Bradley Gother Well done you!! We're all in this gemors together. It's just as bad on UK and Europe. "@Valencia J Are you on ""Live Chat""?" @Valencia J I too don't see some Chatters. Must be a YT thing.... "@Teunis van Ree Yay! These little things are sent to try us @Person of interest Heya GTSY! @ALTA and @zip reeper I believe that our @Smart Guys has greed to a truce. *agreed @Person of interest Another Groundhog Day.

"@Person of interest Vetkoek coming up with your filling of choice "@Bradley Gother ""V"" might be dated Guys n girls. Going to be AFK for a while. BBL xx @Teunis van Ree Coming up. Got to dash upstairs. Ma needs me.... @Barnie Huysamer That guitar duel - simply awesome!!!! Heya @ALTA Ek's terug. Was shops toe. @ALTA Sorree ! Had to go and get fresh veggies for my Thai stir-fry Soz @ALTA. But didn't you and @Louis C stuff your sweet faces with leker vetkoek earlier?? Heya @Smart Guys Glad to see you're still here. Where's my @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee ???? @ALTA Ah! ok! Yes @Ayjay York Sarbanes-Oxley indeed! OMW @ALTA! Hope you three don't have any heartburn!! Naughty you!!! Where's my lovely @Bradley Gother ?

FieliesSA,Ahh @Heather Durr dont leave me hanging as I cant find anything. Only looming arrests and warrant of arrest denials.... @Heather Durr You said he was arrested. Different than warrant of arrest issued Hi! @Aubrey De Bliquy I was hoping to see the Hawks load him in and drive him away. I saw reports from 7th Nov where he(Ace) confirms the warranr has been issued My apologies @Heather Durr I did not see. I dont want him to be arrested because he still needs to spill the finals beans at the state capture and give up his co-conspirators. Hello @ALTA "@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee EFF is making a fuss. Whether you call it work I have never supported them. Malema is wolf in sheep clothing. They are populist and prone to violence. There is no place for them in SA The warrant of arrest is not really new news... His arrest however would... I saw on google trend Ace was calling on Biden to lift Zimbabwe sanctions. Anybody else thinking he might have political plans there...? @Kevin Simon He is cosing up to Zanu-PF by buying brownie points. Thus whey will accept him IF he tries to go over(and have a future)... *they "Yah @Naledi Barron you are probably right. My theory might be core of a conspiracy :). Yes @Kevin Simon @ma baker on 7th Nov he admitted he knows that a warrent has been issued We are sitting at 2K viewers. Considerable less than Myeni at 7 K... Oh no the sound is horrible my poor ears.. "@Teunis van Ree Thats is what has happend with so many(like KZN asbestos project). There are 4 sub tenderers(each with a government official with financial ties) **implicated not charged LOL Ace - Show me one ANC leader that has not done business with the state. That means ALL of them are guilty 🤣🤣🤣. "@Mzalwane Mzala @Aubrey De Bliquy I know and I agree. I just find it funny how he can claim something like that without thinking twice "@Johann If you are a government official "@Johann Thats how it works. Most of them are premiers @Bradley Gother Send me your CV first. If it checks out Ill vote for you 😛 I think the orange overall will compliment Ace's beautifull cheeck bones and bring out his eyes "Im listing that side
BlondeCookieLover 74,we can pretend we have teeth like hofmeyr &smile widely at ace news 😁 @Naledi Barron beware hackers r here 💩💩🤬 let me blaze 1 for ace wonderful new...now for helen zille & her ilk *news @Belinda Stiging still campaigning online for the EFF and Malema thru diverse channels? @ALTA talk to Belinda asb Is Zille not appearing in the Equality Court for anti-Black rhetoric last week in Orania? is it the blonde blonde cookkie that offends? Africa time is FTPoliceSlaveMassa 😈 thx @Gina deW
Aubrey De Bliquy,Hi @Smart Guys We are trying to raise the level of conversation by identifying and blocking irritating trolls who just post lots of spam posts which is anti-social and inconsiderate. Hi @Naledi Barron and @FieliesSA "A warrant of arrest has been issued for the ANC’s secretary-general "@ALTA I saw that Scorpio can reveal that a warrant of arrest has been issued for Magashule and that he will face several corruption-related charges ... "How will that work? If he is in custody it will be easier for him to appear Is it Zondo or SABC that is late? "@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee The thing about the EFF is they get some important things right that nobody else does "Everyone is against corruption Like some people believe the Guptas are disruppting White Monopoly Capital. LOL @Rene Ngwenya victim is a relative term. @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee My difficulty is that WMC is simply nonsense because it is based on the false premise of group guilt. It is unhelpful and inaccurate. "@Valenci @FieliesSA Apparently Ace is expected to appear in court next week. @Naledi Barron I love your little nugges of wisdom. Often we misunderstand one another. @Lee D. Hendrix Why? A wise man? I don't get it. How are you going to solve the land inequity if you reject coherent and efficient executive and rule of law? I personally am convinced that the delay in resolving the urgent land inequity question is being delayed by the notion it can be advanced at the expense of law and order. We are democratic. @Lee D. Hendrix was it a vision or an hallucination? I mean I don't eeven understand what it means. word salad. We make the law. 100 years go men believed heavier than air flight was impossible while birds flew overhead since Adam. We cannot point a finger at incoherent thoughts if we have our own incoherent thoughts to suit our bias. @Lee D. Hendrix Thats deep. "Cool SABC. Sound is distorted. a 3 second echo LOL That must be sabotage. a delayed sound track mixed in "@LionView this is not internet thanks for the tip @Victor @JS Bach Thats deep. Hehehe Its actually a second or two Its a sound track mixing problem at SABC or the court @Victor If our executive is not a custodian of our law it will be up to the smartest crook to take advantage. "SABC 68 model here like the freedom charter. eNCA sound is fine so it can only be Gupta Gremlins in the SABC. Someone tell me when the sound comes right. I am listening on eNCA and watching here. He lacks Kate's passion for her work which she does with a flourish. @zip reeper dredge your mind out of the sewer. LOL You cannot know the meaning of passion. @LionView Sieg Heil. You don't have to read my posts. @LionView You lost me. Thats a bit deep. "@LionView As a matter of curiosity @Salty Crack mute here and listen on eNCA Yes I just noticed. eNA is back. Mute here and listen on eNCA "I never join the witch hunt whether it is Zuma @Bradley Gother Really? Democracy is an illusion of choice? You believe that? What alternative did you have in mind? @bongile sango Mute the sound here and listen on enca. "@Bradley Gother Even if you are the perfect candidate @LionView @Bradley Gother says that a dictatorship with hiim as number one is the best alternative to democracy which is an illusion of choice. The problem is if we do not have a consensus on lawful and unlawful coercion we are in the jungle. It matters less what the consensus is. "@Bradley Gother Where ignorance is bliss @LionView I think orruption in government is just stupid. It cannot even help your supporters if it destroys the only productive value of SOEs. Its dumb. "As long as the market is not dictated by the collective @LionView As ek so is is dit heeltemal onbewus. SABC has been captured by Gupta Gremlins. It looks like a sound it is mixing a delayed signal. SABC technicians should have sorted this long ago so obviously they are all out to late lunch. @LionView where is the problem? What do you want to change? It's funny how the whole narrative is about the bribe instead of purpose of the tender. LOL then they buy some white elephant and don't budget to deploy it to intended benefit. Maybe a sunkissed beach with palm trees and pink drinks. @ALTA Unfortunately it will have to be a local beach 60 million on a beach from saldanha to richards bay Fortunately everyone doesnt prefer the same jholiday destination. "500 "I think tat asbestos problem is becaue there are class action law suits even he cannot stop I think it's a shame to give people a job they cannot do. It is not fair on them. @Naledi Barron Yes. exactly @Naledi Barron The probem is at its extremities the Peter principle can collapse an ecoomy. "@zip reeper That is so sad. When NASA screwed up the Hubble He got a Gupta judge LOL @zip reeper They had a vaccum chamber for testing sattelites and rockets in space. "NASA checked the mirror at atmospheric pressure

Tommy Kernaghan,@zip reeper Ship of Fools is appropriate here 🙂 "@Alhadiah Khan He will apply the ANC 3D policy - Deny @zip reeper They can probably be bought out by ADT 🙂 What is truly sad is that Armscor/Denel (much like Eskom) was envied the world over for their expertise and quality
Thabo Mokoaleli,"The Hawks have issued the warrant of arrest for ANC SG The orange jumpsuit is ready for Ace Magashule👌 The state must repossess their assets and freeze their bank accounts while they stay in jail 👌👍🙋 Ace Magashule is still canvassing votes in Soweto and he was shocked to hear from journalists that the warrant of arrest has been forwarded to his Lawyer 🙈😅😱 Ace Magashule is going to appear in court on Friday in Bloemfontein. l don't think Judge Hlophe will be presiding the case. Judge Hlophe is controversial and he is facing some cases in Cape Town.
