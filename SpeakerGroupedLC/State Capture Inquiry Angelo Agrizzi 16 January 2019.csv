Sipho,Bad sound
Tshepo Selepe,who is testifying today?
Aubrey Moloi,"no testimonies
Lulama Mweli,Thank you Better sound indeed @Thando Nkutha
Bonani Boni,former Bhusasa employee
Derek Main,Bosasa - that should be interesting. Let's see if the ANC is on trial or not. Many ANC cadres involved in Bosasa corruption - it was their piggy bank Yep - can't wait for the testimony to start A vote for the ANC is a vote for more of the same BS What about collective responsibility? @peter sikoshule For eg - the whole of SA knew that Zuma was corrupt to the core but the ANC cadres saved him time and time again subjecting us all to his misrule. We now have to pick up the pieces. OK - there might be one or two innocents but by far the majority of the ANC are corrupt. A huge patronage network. What rock have you been hiding under? Not a day goes past without us hearing of yet another corruption scandal involving the ANC All those voters are hoping for their time at the trough. Otherwise why would they support clearly corrupt office bearers? Somebody has to enlighten the ANC voters Not fast enough - our country is drowning in ANC corruption The ANC voters make the mistake of thinking that the ANC leaders actually care about them "This commission is only happening because the PP ordered that it should happen. If it was left to the ANC "If the ANC has anything to do with it Madonsela said that a commission of inquiry must be established to investigate state capture but Zuma couldn't choose judge. Don't you remember? ANC WAS a nice organisation Ufofu is a rock band from Texas "If they are not looking after our interests
Justice Lewela,"lol
Robert Russell,Moyani was involved trust me M&M's (Moyani & Molefe) = 2 x cry babies Agrizzi's son worked for the ANC as researcher and left when he saw how much corruption was taking place in the ANC.... he must come to the commission and tell us what he saw No matter what comes out in the commission.... the stupid ANC supporters will see no evil and vote the crocks back into power to continue stealing from the poor and then protest for no service deliver Italy has the Mafia...South Africa is the Mafia Yay.... 38 people being chucked under the bus.... the start of the exposure of ANC crooks @Derek Main Exactly ANC Sheepel And the EFF are no different.. Now we can go for that drink Collective corruption = ANC But Bossasa wins for feeding them.... funny that .... Dumb and Dumber working the sound it seems I'm a alcoholic ANC ANC ANC ANC ANC ANC ANC...hic!!! @Derek Main I think they might but they have to move away from cadre deployment jut like they have at Dennel.... the best person for the job who is above reproach is the only way... lets hope and see Time to vote the ANC out I'm with you on that score.... Derek Oh here we go.... the three letter typist are with us again..... FFS

peter sikoshule,please don't mislead ppl. it was not ANC but individuals "when we talk of majority we talk about the voters  yeah there is no ANC without voters and voters are majority voters have been complaining about allegations of corruption in the ANC which doesn't make them corrupt. some even left the party due to their unhappiness. WE AGREE AND WE FIXING individuals in the ANC not ANC. we fixing that . this state capture we watching forms part of cleaning haha haha hahaha glad I didn't mention the name. let's focus on the evidence for now let's say allegation of corruption cos it is alleged until proven madonsela said president must do what? which president ? let me go on tea break as well😂😂😂😂

Ian Kidd,Or much of the conversation it seems somebody in the video team is purposefully updating his windows over the same connection as this stream Michele... Transparency... windows help 😃 and theres zero monetization for them on youtube.. they literally dont care
shalenp,SABC lackeys getting pressure from seniors to disrupt
Michele Koen,Probably down loading torrents. Why do they need windows?
