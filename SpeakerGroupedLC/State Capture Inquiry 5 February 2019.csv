jeevan singh,there's going to to be 4 or 5 of them. yes we want action. begin the arrests. wait for what. arrests now So far DA is clean. agree Dudu No escape. She is done. lock her up now. no games. We want ZUMA in jail. The big fish is ZUMA. MAKANDAKANDA. EFF is Black party. DA is a White party. Is this correct. Makwa. I tend to agree with you. EFF is a Black party. DA is a party of all colors. If only the ANC not stole the money for 24 years. The land would have been back in the hands of the Black people. Opportunity missed. Cameron. 80% of the land in the possession of the Whites. needs to be shared equally amongst all south Africans. ANC failed to buy and build houses All land must be shared equally to all. New NPA boss Shamila batohi is in town. Desmond Nair magistrate must go to jail. YO YO YO.

It is a banana republic Lawrence operated on instructions he is not a hostile witness Have to have faith in our judicial system Ramaphosa has been warned Are black people not afraid of jail? stop playing the racist card. Crime is Crime Yes I don't think they are afraid of jail which is foolish. perhaps because jail is a free meal ticket

Tich Ziny,Am I missing something here? You deliver cash and you dont know how much and for how long? Talk about protecting yourself! Agh
Gershin Boesak,That guy receiving the cash is Jacques van Zyl CFO
Dj Bozeman,Guys... the sad thing is .. nobody is going to jail after this commission of enquiry. It’s all coordinated for election purposes.
