Mathete Maeteletja,🤷🏽‍♂️
Vukile Racaza,Waiting patiently If you understand technology you will know these things happen. You can prepare as much as you like slowly closing in on Zuma and the Guptas IamBlackHouston: I see you are very intelligent hence I am letting you figure it out "@IamBlackHuston @iAmBlackHouston : I care a lot. Some people here are not interested in talking about the subject at hand i.e State Capture. I am hear only for that not for racist statements @Keryn International experts in the subject of State Capture "@Ramushasha Naphtal Takalani no need to be paid and the other witnesses as well are not getting money I wish I could block everyone here who is here to talk about racism. @iAmBlackHouston attention seeker I thought you had blocked me. Ewe makathule You guys are still talking about race?Wow "I managed to block this AmBlackHouston guy
Ishaad Mohammed,🤔i wonder wots the hold up
Lunga Mzimba,they still trying to set up Skype for the video conference
Thiza William,@Floyd then what needs to be done ??? "Some of us fought against white domination and paid with life "South Africa is like a zebra you hit a black spot it dies "our struggle was for a non racial country based on equality Arabia concept is not even an African nbing east Africa nit the continentame but Arab descri Azania Only if black South Africans can travel the world and witness how privilege with opportunities and will stop complaining Life started in Africa so it's a continent of humankind not race Racism its for ignorant or outright stupid people consumed by entitlement mentality You'll never be factually when using race as a defence tactic in a debate black defining themselves by propagating for African nationalismis not new but everytime it failed because it turns to backfire with time Steve Biko advocated for a non radicalism. His struggle was for black emancipation not to dominate whites During decolonisation process in Africa. note what happened after liberation. Once whites left we turned against each other based on tribal affiliation This bull about black must end About blackness Marcus Harvey was a disaster just learn more about him Garvey Know and learn about your history not selective but holistic

Orefile Macheoane,Whats taking our chairperson so long? The last piece of steak? Wow DC in the house I thought we told Trump and the USA to keep their distance. @Ramushasha Naphtal Takalani its the chairperson Eish its the colour conversation again. Lol What is state capture? When they capture all the information about the country. Cute man 😀 @iAmBlackHouston I am taking you to all universities in South africa to educate our kids Ok @iAmBlackHouston I hear you. We are all slick in a way. But we need to rise from our ashes. We cant still be hosting pity parties in 2018. Solutions > problems Well political affiliations are a topic for another day. Lets see how we put ourself at the mercy of the Guptas What do you know about them? Fill me in.. Lets listen to our experts and find out. They about to unpack it for us. "@iAmBlackHouston But the professors are giving you a definition You are a star. (*) "Great stuff Experts are everywhere in life. They happen to give the comission guidance on the subject matter. just as a ballistics expert would give evidence in a murder case. where is Maleka to guide these professors. This is actually very informative. All private entities wish to twist the hand of the public sector. "This  This will be a foundation for the judgements. Expert advice will give the Chairperson guidance and an approach. We have never had a case of State capture before. This will set a precedence. otherwise this has been a case of the blind leading the blind. Asking who did what and where is all circumstance. Very true @Steemit OneAzania "Before Penny Sparrow you cant even prosecute a human being for a labour matter. even if they put you through a lie detector. We cant even prove that money was stolen. All we know is that conversations of influence were had "People were offered minister jobs "i stand to be corrected you cant tell me skin only comes in two colours. i would start to think you are also captured @iAmBlackHouston "@Steemit OneAzania If it was that easy @iAmBlackHouston i honestly believe you refuse to renew your mind. I fear for your children. Well we are doing just fine. We just had a rough background but we are getting there. With knowledge the paradigm of the country will shift "We are doing fine. There is air to breathe 😉 @Steemit OneAzania couldnt agree more. that is why cases like this will help us in this democracy. South Africa has a very solid legal system. We need to find ways to regulate and avoid state capture. May Black Excellence prevail We need to independent operating bodies to regulate government. Thuli Madonsela and her team did well. Scorpions did well. "May we be reminded that no one is above the law "she was slightly conflicted "now im starting to think these guys either love the sound of their own voices This guy would make a great comedian. May you all have a great weekend. Be safe. I pray we all make it through to monday in one peace. piece

Madluphuthu,after all that speculation we now know what was causing the delay. @Gareth Morgan when you have so much brains you need to breath heavily to prevent overheating. arghh somebody tell this guy he is here to answer question. why is he making a speech @iAmBlackHouston 😁😁😁 Amazing how we now call experts from countries that suck our continent's resources dry to come n tell us what state capture means. shouldn't we be asking them when they intend stopping to exploit us? "@Thando Nkutha and whose going to be that presidents @I Am Freedmen because the first world countries steal from us and they have been doing so for many years. @Thando Nkutha point is Africa is too diverse with different visions and goals. I just don't see how our visions could be aligned at this point. "@Thando Nkutha Aw ngeke The real experts are the Guptas cause they have first hand experience with state capturing. They have practices it. Now these experts say state capture is not a criminal issue😕 @White African you say we don't need land to do well. So why did the whites take it away from us if it was so unimportant? "@Steemit OneAzania my question was directed at a statement made by ""white African"". it was not a trail of thought." the evident leaders are letting these two gentlemen go on for too long. their evidence is not being properly guided. and these guys will be paid a lot of money for this. @Floyd Mathebula impossible.

Sindiswa Moolman,"in his interview on ANN7 on 13 November 2017 I want a copy of that report for my thesis on State Capture How much did we pay them for this presentation? Did we follow SCM processes when we hired them? "Some of us like to know what the State Capture actually is Yes @Kojo Parris. Im glued to this. Do want to play chess @iAmBlackHouston ? Was just asking @iAmBlackHouston Our former president did not know that what he agreed upon with the Guptas has a name. This Commission is sending a message to the world that SA is serious about fighting corruption Are you related to Phumla @Thiza William ?
Ramushasha Naphtal Takalani,how much are this guys paid though
Philisiwe Khumalo,why does everything have to be about colour can't it be appreciated that these are scholars who've done thorough study on state capture and understand it better than most of us
j b,Democratic societies engage in corruption too not just communist countries. all society structures can engage in corruption. democracy has monopolies influencing the government like state capture. this appears more of one business doesnt like another business from coming in and competing or taking over. both sides engage in corruption. that's what I'm getting from his Soviet Union reference. isn't it like when they said apartheid is legal when they engaged in such societal structure practices. they had made it into law after they captured SA. they are giving more of a speech than answering questions. why? this is a waste of time. they are wasting tax dollars with these guys. did they ask for their analysis or a history?
Misss Zo,Ohh realy South Africa. No wonder their president feels we need his 2 cents opinion.
clint moodley,must it always end with the crying of black people it was black people that helped withe sate capture Duh why comment if you know nothing about south africa I think that you should concern yourself with Americasn Corporate greed Leave us african alone.

Oscar,somebody must go to jail
hub.grasstruths,@iAmBlackHouston th current prersident not the previous one @iAmBlackHouston I am sure Africans are glad to see you showing an interest but it may be best you sit and learn whats going on @iAmBlackHouston i suggest you refrain from using such racist references here @iAmBlackHousto don't be ridiculous i can't debate with a person who's racism is so entrenched like yours is LOL you are right Thando actually these guys are throwing considerable light on this . the south american states have the same problems LOL I have some justuse brain power for these types; they are clueless They are away Googling 'Mzansi President or President of Lambia' who is he? State capture of Lamibia -0 who is state president.. please Google tell me ;-) hidden agendas @Althea Oehlschlägel i can tell you the term was used in the late 90's already among comrades who would joke.. the term was previously - to suggest counter revolutionary tendencies. but the ANC lost it's 'revolutionary' rheteroric "then the term became 'that comrade is cpatured' it meant his brain was so weak "yes "@Madluphuthu by sister this witness is making a lot of sense. butthe problem is the checks dont work because the people in parliamentare all thieves too a lotof people can't understand the testimony or google for that matter ;-) eish thista\ racist is like a mosquito @Orefile Macheoane absolutely it is placingthis in a global context and perhaps we can find a way to secure the state better the witnesses prior to this were just talkingabouttheir observations and whatthey were offered and didnt do. They never pointed a finger at any person where that person could be charged "@Orefile Macheoane this is true I agree withyou. The public is here hoping to find outwho did what.. so far I have no confidence in this process. Actually. No one will be jailed and Ithink these suggestions the judge will make based on this impportanttestimony will not be implemented. we heard this in the steinhof case today too there is no political will to change anything because it works - it is paracite-friendly @EMILY PHENYA yes i dont see the pointto have all these inquiries. we dont need this - we have courts of law this is an expensive side show @Orefile Macheoane these guys stole state money - there has to be a way to prosecute them @lesetsa maenetja guptas didn't do anything worse than any other thief. the biggest thieves are the politicians. we should round them up and jail them for life @EMILY PHENYA for sure! already you and I can go look at one of thoise breakfast shows. all thjose people should not sleep in their sandtom bedrooms tonight @Orefile Macheoane I dont believe it can be so hard to prosecute. There is just a protection of these guys we had witnesses so far who can be cross examined to reveal a lot more but they are being softly questioned. its a collusion to protec their bosses. they are all captured even now @Orefile Macheoane i am too toired to argue with such racist minded people again 😉 @Kojo Parris it will just be ignored if it goes against the political objective i.e. a cover up "@Kojo Parris absolutely - when Cyril left the cabinet and went to business @iAmBlackHouston plkease my friend.. stop your racism here @Madluphuthu the people who were captured are the ANC politicians. They would be captured by anyone - not just the Guptas "@iAmBlackHouston you have no clue what you are talking about - respectfully look in the mirror and you will see it @Kojo Parris absolutely - agree with you. The more sophisticated versions are laughing this whole process off because they do this with more finesse @Orefile Macheoane as a nation we have to hold the politicans to order with the objectives of our struggle. That is a whole different level of protection. thats why our public protector is important this testimony is from a western angle - they are not looking atthe public protectors role state capture is not lobbying - in our context i think it is defined a little differently @White African you are rightmy friend. "I like your name though 😉 but I disagree in one respect. I believe that black is a state of mind which would cause me to consider yout obe a black african like myself "Youknow - when someone does what Zuma and others have done @Millicent Shozi there are racists here everyday they have weak brain power we can easily putthem onto google search. it gives us a break from them they canteven name the president of Lamibia. ... --- wait five minutes we will get an answer @White African yes myfriend. we all see it. sopme are runningfrom it denying it. I have three kids - I worry aboutthem too @Orefile Macheoane we could see how her report was hamstrung. The politicians all backed the corruption Please people dont get into this business. we are one nation one azania - anti racial. 😉 otherwise we get side tracked this foreign troll is here for neferious reasons "@Madluphuthu rather than make blanket statements like this attacking people makingthem feel they should be feeling guilty wont get any of us anywhere. I am also landless just like many others here they have been too busy stealing from the coffers for themselves and to keep their own friends in the gravy. the peopel have remained disempowered. now they want us to fight each other all over again go well my friends. @White African try to avoid fallking intothis race baiting my friend. dont apologise for who you are either. you are an african finish and klaar yes yes leave itmy friend no need to go there. it wont go anywhere positive even it is true. @Thiza William this is true but you know why we fell from that powerful situation like the great zimbabwe? because of tribalism my friend. we cant always look outside for reasons for opur failure even this debacle here. we want to balme a fat guy in dubai or india? when it is our own peopel @Thiza William I wantto hug you 😃 no one will go to jail they are intellectualisingthe issue. givving their pals a nice fat payment for legal services but no one goes to jail dontgive in to the bait my friends why do you do that? 😉 these are racist trolls - they are posing as black racists and white racists @Mzalwane Mzala exact;ly - so why are they not being proecuted? can you define what an african is @Blak N Eazzy according to marcus and you? and then define according to Biko what is black? ok in other words you can't @Blak N Eazzy notat all. Biko was not influenced by Garvey directly. YOu should study biko's papers a bit ignorance loves company black consciousness? youmean the kind bieng punted these days in politics or the real black consciousnes of anti-racism? the most intense and ignorantracists in south african politics today claim to be black conscious - Biko must be turning in his grave in Ginsburg @Blak N Eazzy when you can defien black people tell me you use the words black people a lot. and african people at home and abroad. but what do you mean by it @Thiza William youare right but When Biko said Black he was not using race as an anti racist he meant something different. The problem is the current use of this word is despicable I agree with you @Thiza William the term is still necessary but only in a situation where peopel are honest abouttheir inferiorotyy and stop clinging to race as defined by apartheid @Thiza William youare a wise lady or man. I agree .. Biko also had nothing to do wioth Garvey - he was certainly not a prodigy of Garvey

R Botha,just use gas a lot of people in here are just complaining cos they don't understand or are not listening. or are to focused on skin color that's called ignorance. they are making great points and making a great case to make all those thugs that's been stealing from all of SA pay they are giving us a great foundation to fight back. it would have killed us all Sa cant even take care of coal power plants what do you think would happen with nuclear it would blow SA back to the stone ages we also had nuclear bombs we are the only ones in the world that gave them up they are not worth the loss of life if Julias could see all in SA as a nation and not as different tribes then i might have stood by his side. Sadly he can not see past the struggle of the past but not the one SA has today Housten you should go play in the park all i know is this SA is Doomed if SA does not put their differences aside and think about their futures. we need to start holding our leaders responsible. all they do is rob the poor and make our lives real expensive and you need to shut the F^%$## up we need to stomp on its head these ppl dont have to be just need to stop coruption i am tired of seeing children looking for jobs we need a gov that cares about SA but it will only happen if the people can come together as a Nation i dont have land but im doing fine you don't need land to do well you need to use your brain no i am a white african i know black people with land and it is not being used. the whited don't own all the land. and all the land that china owns is seen as wite land white and didnt the bantu people also take land thru conquest its sad but true some people cant see past tier own nose i pity you freed man hahahaha seriosly is that it your a lost soul
