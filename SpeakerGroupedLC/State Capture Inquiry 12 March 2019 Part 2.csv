Sebation Nantsika,Sesikhona The only way to fight this battle is move fast to government institutions because of those who were following Z stl using government resources to fight the current President especially treasury We are going to vote for ANC vela @nditsheni thanx my brother @mike tell me what are you not satisfied about? @Mike how? @mike did you vote for ANC before and when was it?
Anne M.,This witness is not well prepared. How many times has he been told to find out things and provide information to the commission? @Thando Nkutha A simple question of whether or not they had an overdraft? @Thando Nkutha Correct and a lot of the information is in the public domain Agree - they were selective about who they checked. My bank wouldn't release my bonus until they received confirmation from my employer that it was genuine transaction. "@Thando Nkutha Yup @welton paulse üòÉ I like your thinking - if only it were possible @Thando Nkutha And that's where I start to get seriously p-d off. "@welton paulse Yes @Thando Nkutha In Dubai wasn't it? @Ndidendavela Mgudlwa I'm not sure but I have subscribed to SABC Digital News and don't get adverts. Maybe that's what you need to do. Key mandate - another word for kickbacks smh "@Eslon Eslon If it was between SA bank accounts "@Thando Nkutha And this is why Standard Bank's legal rep is here The corruption tentacles stretched far and wide @Thando Nkutha Then the bank's relationship manager/s should also be investigated. @Cigar Fox üòâ Bring all the corrupt people back from overseas\ "@cassim suleman Look at the timing. When did the banks inform the Reserve Bank @Toni john The fictitious country in the movie Black Panther. "@Michael Wild If I remember correctly
Bridgette Kekana,hello eish ran out og data Africa is not poor continent they hv relocated already even Gavin Watson @Thando üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Magda Seguin,@Anne M. True..They were indicted in 2018 There were 3 directors at Regiments Capital @Marks mokwena last time I look3d SA was a sovereign country. Zuma is responsible.Period.Stop looking for gj Stop looking for excuses for a failed government It's obvious you are brainwashed @marks mokwena...children dying in pit toilets for a starter is it also the fault of the 'West?' You should have lived in SA to educate yourself on the past 25 year rule of the ANC You need more insight...@Marks mokwena.Are you a racist? "@marks mokwena...so Zuma Maybe you are right...The Guptas oppressed the ANC It's actually laughable that so.eine can condone state capture and blame invisible 'western oppressors' Wish @marks mokwena you need help You seem to read fake news a lot The ANC had 25 years!! a lifetime...They promised Utopia and look what happened Youth unemployment is 28%...check out StatsSA Make that Gupta beneficiary.....They together with Zuma they mad made SA a prospwctive failed state There are many other tax havens read rge Panama papers Because the African leaders don't care for their people People are fleeing from Africa to Europe dying in boats in the Mediterranean sea...African leaders should be ashamed I travelled to many African countries the past ten years...12 to be exact north to south...The poverty is unreal I So called traditional leaders oppressed women and still do I rest my case with marks mokwena...he is totally captured by populist ideologies Stop the self hate @Marks mokwena...I am a true Khoisan and I don't hate anybody in spite of how my people are oppressed by the ANC On this forum most provocateurs are race baiters like marks mokwena...They has a the everyone with their nonsense on a daily basis.I should know better not to respond to them "I am not fighting
Wildthing,why has Salim not been arrested already he is buddies with Koko and other ANC members. like the guy that visited the Shabeen. agree Welton agree but to much is know now the ball us rolling down the mountain. and it's going to knock many trees down SARS should have questioned all of this actions too at the time. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è stupid comment Mark. each company has it's own auditing and compliance staff that should pick that up. external audit are then the outside police. and yes in this case guilty. Think you need tolook up the swiss laws. as it is not that easy to place money in Swiss banks like the old days. lots of laws black bad money from going there. rather look at bitcoin and other tools Mark just hates whites so no hope there. so Mark you admit its and African problem I guess you don't know the stats on who looks after all the orphaned children on SA. who helps them the most. we voted NP out to make better life for all the Zumas ANC came and fokked it up. all this money stolen should have helped the poor. if channelled correctly. so Mark you lost Mark name them Mark when did Africa first invent the wheel. sorry don't mean to down anyone else just the hard head. Yes Mark you right this has happened world wide. people go look for better ways tolive. just like the Buntu travelled doe South to find better land and food. Mark why do you buy a car to travel with "The National Prosecuting Authority says former president Jacob Zuma's application for a stay of prosecution should be dismissed Mark so you have your answer then. westerners went to other countries to find better minerals to build the things we use today. without DRC Cobalt we would.not be chatting now. but it's the DRC Govt who is stealing from there own people by not channeling the money to the poor. seems the same happens in SA now who knows who was the first person to walk on earth. history keeps changing. I wish it was from Joburg. then we would all be the same. all have the same great √ó100 granny. üòÖ agree Thando sorry Mark don't dislike you but will say bye to you and block you cheers. that's democracy Bye Fox I vote you out too. it's called Monet laundering bye @worldoflosttanks it's called money laundering. washing the movements of money it will be the same way they trace the VBS money movements. cant hide it. R1 is R1 it does not disappear when moved around it leaves a breadcrumb trail. just need to follow it. yes Eslon who in this world can pay cash for a $46.000.000 house in Dubai. where did that money come from. it's a Gupta company Santosh Choubey. owns Cutting Edge and works for Guptas. same as Trillian and Eric Wood Eslon and SARS but we know someone was placed there to stop looking into this. and SSA too. because they stealing SA money from the govt we know that Zuma visited Dubai 2 times in two weeks and send other MPs through Dubai around the same time. and some people say they had cash and diamonds with them but that is to be proven. next investigation is to see where the money went to where it is now. and why SARS did not get involved Denel also involved now we want to know when you informed the authorities about the money movements They are guilty for not reporting it. but to who. if it was government then they would not act. agreed All of them that took cash in a bag are just as guilty. Zonda needs to give instructions now not wait until the end of SC. people need to be arrested. otherwise the process will fail the same as the Banks and other areas that should have taken action. Anne yes but still no action. we need the wheels to turn. or you get names faster. you going to jail for 30 years. but each name you give gets you 2 months less. the chickens will talk. bye for now.

welton paulse,i think the government should give tax payers to option to claim their tax back from the Guptas and BOSASA it is really sad to see how our beautiful country has become a place where outsiders can just come and do as they please.
