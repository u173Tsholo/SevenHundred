"@Talent P Sibisi something's very wrong with the ANC "@Felix Muyoba  of course an organisation is made up of people. he's asleep I've had it with an ANC government. My vote is for others Maleka wants to understand Medupi and Kusile's cost overruns...wow! Will this commission get beyond Eskom with such a wide scope?

ESKOM was an apartheid project for national pride.. @Joel Mzayidume disagree..no problem with anc but individuals.. @Joel Mzayidume but it is the people themselves who are making it dysfunctional and not itself @Joel Mzayidume so the individuals are the problem not anc @Norman Zwane i hear you "@Thulani Bukani i dont understand your argument "@Norman Zwane no man @Michael Michael CIC who else? @John-Basel Ioannou but they will behave once they are running the country @Robert Russell you forgot to add the influence of the imperialists in those failures @Robert Russell zimbabwe + venezuela - imperialists = success

Jack Sparrow,@Real State capture is a type of systemic political corruption in which private interests significantly influence a state's decision-making processes to their own advantage. "@Felix Muyoba Nope @Reconcilition Booi The EFF's twitter army is small but active @Jngle Pssy blahblah blah @Jngle Pssy blah blah blah "@Sandile Ntando Ntuli Hahaha!

Andre' Van Zyl,"Neo
Born free,Thank you Andre.. some people are ignorant @ Neo 😂😂😂😂😂😂 true that Including the straight hair No racism just an observation why does the State Capture Enquiry start so late? I understand this enquiry has to be wrapped up by May at this snails pace rate it will go on forever 😟 I was referring to Zuma and his party who is going to listen to the budget speech.. more taxes for the taxpayer so depressing 😪 Not sure when the Budget Speech will be addressed . This afternoon I have just heard. Taxpayers have to pay for Eskom😱 ANC ministers are not qualified to govern that's the truth of the matter.

Norman Zwane,@Thembi Maliwa McBride's long list of implicated persons needed to be warned. So his presentation was rescheduled to after Eskom. I think there are peeps who must be arrested urgently re Eskom "@Cebo Khumalo It would be too risky for those to testify. I have not even heard them wanting to cross question anyone yet Trouble right now for us to make sense of stuff there too many skeletons tumbling out of cabinets. Mazzotti the erstwhile benefactor of the fighters had his movable assets attached by SARS. That may start yet another ball rolling. "@Eslon Eslon If I was their counsel I'd be saying ""Go to Dubai boys""" "@Joel Mzayidume Tjhe commissioner is obliged to; but if they were stuck in Dubai "@Joel Mzayidume I think the investigators have stolen your thunder Joel. They've taken a short cut @Talent P Sibisi Hai wena just leave uRay ne voice yakhe alone. @Singi Mathebula I think the devine intervention will now come from Barry Roux since Major 1 has engaged that Senior Councelor @Talent P Sibisi Shem he is. WayesoNgoye in 1980 @Eslon Eslon Immagine the concequences: implicated by implication. I doubt if we have suitable case-law to make that leap. @Thando Nkutha I wish I could share your hope that we will recover -period. UZuma usibulele nje. We may need the Lazarus ressurection strue "@Thando Nkutha We so down @Thando Nkutha Cyril is not weak. I have seen him at his best. The problems are just overwhelming. There are fires on every visible horizon. I expect he is like all of overwhelmed. What comes first? "@Thando Nkutha You optimist you! We are a failed state ""IN PROGRESS"". How sweet!
