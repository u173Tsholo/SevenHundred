Anne M.,Well done Detective Seguin @Kgabo Manamela That's at the PIC inquiry Has she made a deal with the Hawks which allowed her to emigrate to the USA? Thank you @CJ30 X I was thinking the same thing. @Robert Russell Very scary @viva padrepio @Born free Please @RAMESHAN ACHARI go to another (appropriate) forum and leave the adults to discuss the commission of inquiry. "@Lex Luger Airport Coordinator -SA Express The Commission has a website and lists the days witnesses eNCA also broadcasts the inquiry (with a chat section) Our President or the BLF president? Ta

Kgabo Manamela,"Magda Seguin OK
Felix Muyoba,true..it wasnt a cash in transit business.. @Thapelo Motabogi i think you were right..the commission was supposed to ask this ladys qualifications.. i dont think she went far in school.. she cant run a business without knowing what is happening.. she has to repay back the money..she is already a bankrupt person.. him or her.. the reason why these business close down is because they are illegal @Born free am starting to like trump as well especially after calling off the strike on iran..that was a very bold move because that doesnt mean america is afraid of iran.. today is a day of mevrou/juvrou @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU 😂😂😂no man airport coordinator..what is that? no man this sounds like she was a cfo of sax..what are her qualifications in finance? a coordinator doesnt have to do all those technical stuff.. but didnt she prepare for this before she came?

Bongani Ntuli,we are back guys
Caroline Hawanga,Thank you Magda!
clive oconnell,"I think she’s been groomed on Q/A by lawyers CJ30 X It wasn’t Capitalism that bribed Zuma into Russian power plants built in SA @Derek When you off to work in Venezuela or Cuba @CJ30 X This isn’t a haircut competition with Trump @Derek Main Your be going on holiday to N Korea to see the freedom of non capitalist state. Quite New witness! Stay on subject @Born free I think we should keep an open mind when dealing with the brain washed majority Trump Trump 🐘🐘 Enough 👀 🐘🐘Trump Trump Not again Blink blink yes chair ooops 💤💤 bored 😑
Derek Main,I don't think Ms Viljoen realises how much trouble she is in. @Cerebis That may be true but capitalism is not doing too well either. Something has to change. @CJ30 X I agree with you - capitalism is a system that rewards sociopaths. @clive oconnell But it is the nature of the beast. @CJ30 X Because he epitomises capitalism. @clive oconnell Lame argument. @Born free Holy c**p! You sound just like ANC members defending Zuma. @viva padrepio If only it were just national security - you lot spread your violence across the planet. The biggest rogue state around. "@Born free If you think Trumo has done nothing wrong @Born free So then you know of his links to the mafia and how he has flouted tax and city planning regulations etc. How can you say he's done nothing wrong? @Born free I guess that means you get your news from Fox. No - I don't watch CNN. @viva padrepio Is the US still bombing innocent civilians in the Middle East? @Born free Pull the other one - it's got bells on it. What about the drone strikes? @viva padrepio Now explains why the US feels at liberty to wreak havoc around the world. Yankee go home. @Born free That sounds like a convenient excuse. @makhosi nobhatyi They're all corrupt. @makhosi nobhatyi 😁 Just thought I'd remind you. @Born free Some capitalist c**t. @makhosi nobhatyi There have been plenty of charges laid against corrupt officials and those cases have disappeared into thin air. @makhosi nobhatyi So you say but I'm not so sure. Many of the same corrupt cadres have been appointed to critical positions by the ANC so what has really changed under Ramaphosa. @Born free Yes - he was sold out by a French impimpi. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Thanks for the compliment but I'm too honest to be a lawyer. @viva padrepio The Trump website is for racists.
carnoth ngomane,@Felix Muyoba i think she did shes just playing dumb and acting as a victim The evidence leader is asleep already
Thulani Bukani,Viljoen thinks she's an ANC MP yhooo ziyabila capitalism means someone has to be poor I dont think she realises whats going on here why are we talking about Trump?
Robert Russell,ROFLMAO @Thulani Bukani Hey Magda..... you should collaborate with Pieter- Louis Myberg and write a book as well.... Then even more so..... write a book.... magda Trump is unhinged.... isn't it scary that there is no one to stop him from pushing the big N button????? """Loock"""" ...... they stole the airport tractor as well..... 😃" OMF..... this is the class of Zuma ....8.5k liters * 52 weeks = 442 Liters PA..... the revolution has already started.... watch this space....@Born free
matsobane1,Interesting analogy @Magda. You remind me of Bitcoin and Blockchains. "@Magda Seguin Republic of South Africa is a company registered here in USA. So she can be held liable on conditions NPA files a case.
Norman Zwane,Are you listening Shamila! @Thando Nkutha You think a stokvel islaundering? Bafa ogogo bakithi nge stokie abasikhonze kangaka! Say you are joking Nkutha Looks like the beautiful georgeous Ms September is up next. I'm going to give my toilet break a miss. "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I get the same sense too @Nelson Musoliwa and they still got promoted to go right up to Champions league Ahhhh Ms September @T G Swartlane You ae not allowed to ask. Next question please. "@Nelson Musoliwa I nolonger ""watch this space"" after what the Proteas did. The space was never filled with wickets or runs." @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU You wish. This woman does not live in Burgersford! "Maybe I judged too early Everybody? @Yolo More I'm still waiting my turn! @Thando Nkutha This @Yolo More must be a Motswana - they ate alone in the bedroom and then claim everyone has eaten. @Yolo More They are quite well knon for their lack of food distribution. You attend thir wedding without your own padkos you'll almost starve whilst the plates are flying around. @makhosi nobhatyi So david Mabuza will be President from next week? CR is going down with the BOSASA matter "@Felix Muyoba What's eating you @Felix Muyoba The stammer is for my appreciation @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Cannot believe anyone who did not vote for zuma would watch the Proteas. @makhosi nobhatyi If PPwas a male I'd advise them to go to Men's clinic. She tends to shoot prematurely. @Cobus Opperman She is the 'grave-yard' shift lead witness. she already has lost us half the listeners. People are googling Mkhwebane instead. @Felix Muyoba Those eyes are killing me? Somehow I'm even learning to lip read her. So turn down the volume and just imagine her saying sweet nothings to you too. @Thando Nkutha Uyaphi lapho +FF? Khuzeka! "@makhosi nobhatyi Most of the 'company owners' with very rich tenders sound stupid on the stand Kanti bangakhi abo Stompie emhlabeni. Mama give us a guide! @Born free Clearly she did not have a complete audit of folk with such a name. @Thando Nkutha Aphi amang' ami? @Naledzani Mashau How you know about the loo ones? @makhosi nobhatyi Now that is something. Mngxithama was captured? I feel sorry for wha captured so tasteless a beast. I'd spit him out. @Naledzani Mashau Gotcha!! Got me there!! I was already going X rated. Nice one. "@Sofia Sofia @Millicent Shozi All I wanted to do was drool at Ms September. I have no clue what she is trying to uncover "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU At least you know what one man is doing "@Millicent Shozi Best idea @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU You had an ex that hot Keith? Tjo!!!!! @Sthakathi Khumalo Amen!!
Born free,Koreneka will have to pay back the money to SAX Ignorance won't save her nor the owner of Koreneka Keep America and Israel Great A deal with the devil.. she was supeoned therefore she is compelled to give evidence We don't want socialism it leads to a failed state.. this is socialism Trump victory 2020 Trump will win that's a fact Trump victory 2020. Trump win fairly and squarely and he is doing a great job. Trump has done nothing wrong but Crooked Clinton's and Obama and the Bushes should be in jail I don't think Trump can trust his military advisers. He has to trust his own instincts I am a holy patriot of Trumps and not Zuma you cannot compare the two there is no comparison Well Trump did just that I am well read on Trump.. thanks Derek you must watch CNN I The democrats are Aliens for Aliens and mostly illegal Aliens They are all robots in North Korea @viva.. yes on a daily basis. Our farmers must arm themselves at all times and shoot to kill the warning shots come after the fact. not farm workers the farm owners and managers Now we have an Islamic extremists on this chat site It is the Russians and the Syrian government bombing innocent civilians Must take these Arabs along time to scribble like that 🤣🤣 @Derek.. there are mercenaries involved in these wars and they are from all countries. They fight for whoever pays them the most money they have no allegiance to any side. It looks like scribble haha right Pastor @pastor. He is talking about the heatwave in India Yes Clive that's why my paws are over my eyes 🤣🤣 Trump is completely open to his base and it is the silent majority that support him. Trump victory 2020 That's not writing that is doodling referring to the hackers OH No we don't want David Mabuza he has a muddied past She is from SAX Lex.. if you are a bit lost you can replay this video in your own time to catch up. You can watch all the play backs on YouTube Pastor Pastor do you like Jesus Juice?? 🤣 Pastor just try some Southern Comfort on the rocks Mr Rameshan it was more interesting when you wrote about the heatwave in Hindi I thought Winnie had killed Stompie years ago? In and out I am only aware of one Stompie who was part of of Winnie's football club. She got rid of of him and got away with it. Yip I have to watch I have a book to write Shame the evidence leader is rather boring 🍷🍷 @Derek Main.. who shot Che? I liked Che he had courage. @Derek Main.. I think Che was betrayed there was a price on his head but he died with courage and conviction when he looked his killer in the eyes. @ Derek yes lawyers are Liars and use technical terms to argue their cases. Whoever is the most convincing wins. This witness is not implicated This witness did her job I don't think her opinion would have mattered to those implicated. Who is the witness tomorrow????? @ Viva.. that comment is below the belt please withdraw Where is the Sergeant in arms?? @ Viva.. that should be a private thought and not a public one Panties are too expensive Yes I am a patriot of Trumps Trump is working for all Americans just not illegal Aliens and that's what each country should be focused on. I must say I have never seen such a abandonment of black children and begging.. @ Pastor Pastor. what is your congregation doing about all the homeless children and drug addicts??? Homeless abandoned black children everywhere. Does the Government and Pastors have a solution to this terrible problem??? The fuel was used to fill the cars of the theives or to sell for their own gain. Perhaps it was used to fuel the Guptas plane I want to start a revolution A revolution against corruption You cannot buy class it is bred in a person. There is no class in the ANC Ben Carson for President we need a black Trump to run this country
Amen Nkosi,ya sax
