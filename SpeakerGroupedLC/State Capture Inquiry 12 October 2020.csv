Adore Shebu,Zwane's shananigans time is over. there's no one to protect him now. I can't wait to see his property seized "Zwane looks like he has lost weight in two weeks "@Tom correct
Jenny Whitewaves,I think he has been tutored by his lawyers since last appearance or by Ace's lawyers It must be on his mind that The Hawks said they waited to let the guys they arrested finish to testify before they acted Small words short sentences little by little he will tie himself in knots Can't be my list or I am done for It can;t be Ace's list or I am dead So it must be the tooth fairy's list "@Russell Matsane at 1st I was against amnesty but I wonder if by cutting our losses as long as amnesty includes an admission of wrongdoing and removal from power If the counrty is made unstable by the likes of Ace and Zuma we will never get the investment we need to drag the economy to it's feet These uys are such practiced liars that it wouldn't show on a polygraph @Valencia J you sound back on form and recovered so glad @Naledi Barron thanks Zwane can't give a plain answer if he wrote the list =jail If he tells the truth it came from Ace than he's brakes will fail on his very expensive car Just thunk how rough it would be to be either DCJ or mr P's teenager explaining why you were late for your curfew I think he is a great dad but no fooling him Judge Judy has 6 kids she says you can tell a teenager is lying when his lips are moving same as this guy @Heather Durr welcome "When DCJ says ""that;s very strange------- :be afraid very afraid" @Ace Magashule but here's the blue dress Bye people have to go now enjoy this round about

DokoloCity,until a dispute arised lol @Moses Sowage does you mother pay taxes.. You dont use an open tender everytime DCJ so the official is correct You can fault him for using this database the problem with the database was expired that is why the problem is that database is a preqalification database.. i think the chair is applying the PFMA incorrectly exactly the database is a prequalification chair @isaac mafume you are the only who knows the process.. i think the DCJ is making a mistake here Chair the databases is a process of an open tender ... eish remember the contractors are appointed for 5 years so there is no need to confirm value @isaac mafume I agree there is no debate here in as much as we want to find fault with him i think find something else to pin this guy on.... dont ask him what he can remember lol Adv has done a bad job here... @summer de nobrega This particular argument they are not doing their job Chair is there is theory and practice? dont forget housing is a rolling stock.. the contractors are already in the database @summer de nobrega how is he lying? it the two who are not grounded in their questions contract deviation chair exco can approve it Ad you didnt do you homework clown you did everything wrong Adv Adv and DCJ need to do more research on the database and tender process for sure Rabbit hole of database

The last time he was here he tried to strongarm the Commission into letting him answer all his cases on one day.Judge put him right quickly. They deal with different workstreams🤣 Ace told him that not the officials As a layman!!!!!!! I have had enough of this layman! Tell him Mr P!!!!!! @Bekithemba Ncube . He was very confident the last time that he appeared at the commission. But that was before the Hawks pounced!!!! Zwane remembers absolutely nothing. It seems he was just an errand boy @Charmaine Smith . He is educated but he is playing dumb He remembers very little🙃 @Zs H.H. and a trip to India for Mr Zwane and his Gospel Choir @fuzile dazana . Very disappointing. This witness is wasting our time @Lulu Baby . He will be back. Has been implicated in other matters Hayibo........this is administrative work that he has no knowledge about!!!!A whole MEC!!!! Advocate wants to know what resides in Zwane's memory🤣🤣🤣 'The little knowledge'......... He once read the Housing Act ...as a layman🤣🤣🤣 This one was getting paid for doing bogger all @David Mjamba . These are not leaders. They are ANC deployees @Linda Sydney Mnisi . He doesnt realize that by calling himself a layman he is not doing himself any favours He won't know the answer to that question....its too difficult for him If you pay for material 'from where I am sitting' it is not a pre-payment....They 'were helping ' the contractors🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Please answer the question Zwane Fr Christmas Zwane🤣🤣🤣🤣 Zondo just gave him a KO!!!! Now he hadn't properly processed the proposal🤣 This one......He is too much!!!!🤭🤭🤭🤭 He put the question to people who were learned unlike him the layman🤣 Zwane thought he was working for a benevolent society....He wanted to help the Contractors🤣 @Ettiene Meyer . For that reason ex No 1 does not wish to appear before this Commission @a b c . That is his choir voice So who decided on giving advance payments? They were not proposals they were instructions He wasnt aware Mr P. He is a layman🤣 Word of the Day.....'layman'😂 Mr Mosebenzi Layman Zwane🤣 A layman in charge of a huge budget!!!!!!!!! When this one was appointed MEC what brief was he given????? He must be held accountable for this huge loss of money... @Moses Sowage .

isaac mafume,The listing of suppliers on a database follows a transparent and competitive process. Nothing wrong with proper pre qualification of bidders @DokoloCity I dont understand how this issue is taking a lot of time. Its normal practice to pre qualify bidders in the construction sector.

They should invite a supply chain expert to explain these processes and the PFMA

Mahlomola A Mohlomi,Is there something I need to drink to understand what Zwane is saying? "Sometimes I think the Chair helps these people answer the questions. Leave them to squirm from the questions of Mr P

TSATSI,its not your fault then?
Nkosi Da Perf,"couldnt gov purchase the inventory themselves instead of making advance payments so inventory was the excuse to make advance payments to contractors. why couldnt the department purchase and control the release of inventory. perhaps based on completed houses per release. "the excuse is made to seem as a bridge to cover the economic inequality how is an MEC a layman? Do these leaders declare their ability before taking office.
Romario. Nkosi,it seems as if something just got stucked in his throat .... you can not run away Mr Worker .... why can't ask Zondo to call your friends for assistance 🤣😂🤣😂🤣 why can't we help the contractors to make the material available for them and the question is How ? Pretorius needs a clarify or a straight answer not ukubaleka @ Cynthia 100% correct am with you on that point does the word cadre means these crooks must steal from the poor because were not in Roben Island mxm ..... let them go back to Jail 🙅 when is Mr Asbestos magashule coming to the Zondo commission ?
