INTELLIGENT BEING indeed Lots to learn about economic matters from Fuzile testimony appeal to all to listen attentively and jot some words down for later scrutiny for future reference Fuzile was trying to be professional and attempting to allays the nation and international fears about nene dismissal but gupta minister has non of this @peter protocol are protocol as set out to preserve the institution integrity of course protecting one job is a secondary issue against the national issue Am lost where u r now what charges@peter @Peter ohoo it was not easy as it was a cumulative and perceived actions by the looters which appears to be systematic. I may be wrong. Zondo may ask Fuzile how the supposed guy knew him @peter you r 100% on point SA is economically misdirected

Blaze 613,Ramaphosa to announce cabinet reshuffle at 3PM "yip not a midnight shuffle lol saw it on enca
lee royal,who this guy asking these questions he looks sounds Zimbabwean @Michael Mpagi @Simphiwe Dube guys apologies i was just asking @Thando Nkutha i was just thinking what do the Zimbabweans have to do with South African matters thats all @Michael Mpagi dont worry we getting the land back soon... @Thando Nkutha i was just asking thats all...making sure nothing wrong with asking @Thando Nkutha white people in SA hire people from zim while we have a high youth unemployment rate and then we south africans are considered lazy...im just for empowering black south africans first Zimbabwe as a country may not be trading with the world however the Zimbabwean people are fine they are working in SA and other countries the South African youth are unskilled most of them work in call centers ...Our education system hasn't changed since the so called rainbow nation change happened @Thando Nkutha "@Thando Nkutha i see your a pan africanist however we need to solve our problem first we are suffering because white people chose not to trade with zim however the zim ppl are still working in SA now that affects us...the white people are using them in our own country @Thando Nkutha @Thando Nkutha all im saying is that if we say the world isnt trading with zim shouldnt that apply to the people from zim? we separate the two like the Zimbabwe the country can starve...its land @Quinton Van Den Bergh your entitled that is why you would say something so stupid @Sam Vanguard go to Europe why are you in africa? to use our people and live better? @Quinton Van Den Bergh next year if we dont get the land we going to War we coming to your house in sandton @Sam Vanguard you too @Thando Nkutha Voting for the EFF means we going to fight like it or not @Thando Nkutha dont you think that once the EFF wins the first law would be to remove the white and indian minority 1st
Michael Myers,lee royal so what you didnt ask about the white man paul lee royal we should never attack our own people for the white man to benefit lee royal why do indians and whites who are less then 15 percent run the country hope so to lee Zimbabwe is fine. white people just dont want to lose their wealth black south africans and black people globally are in a recession ziimbabwe is fine if anyone tell u different theyre lying
Sindiswa Moolman,There will be a cabinet reshuffle at 15h00 this afternoon. Things have really changed. No more midnight resuffles So you are counting @Desmond Masilela At 15h00 @Desmond Masilela
The Xilaman,Enca has better visuals
Simphiwe Dube,@lee royal did you ask about Pretorius? @lee royal he (Adv Maleka) is south African anyway "Adv Maleka is the best evidence leader @holylady1000 I think hes lying too. Looking at how intelligent he is theres no way he cant remember who invited him Who was the Indian guy Lungile?? 11:35
Sthakathi Khumalo,State Capture has been a CCMA rebellion of disgruntled employees!! "em D Exactly bro This is one just reciting poetry! Who is next after this one?? You see his boss is Trevor Manuel!1 What have I missed here? Anything new and burning that Fuzile has presented people?? I was listening to Jackson Mthembu trying to spin rubbish.. Cyril Must account admit he lied and face parliamentary might! Khusela Diko has tried spinning but Cyril must account for lying
Mhlanguli Dlodlo,@Sthakathi Khumalo CCMA hearing lol. I'm getting the same sense. I particularly remember feeling the same way about Ms Phumla Williams' testimony "Please chair ask him a little bit more how Mr Godongwana knew and could pre-empt what was to happen Was it not predictable that Des was going to bring the same advisors he had whip on the of Finance and of the Economic Transformation in parliament. Any one in the ANC would have known that
Mkhuseli Freddie,@peter pott I agree with you. We are caught in ANC factional battles and the commission is used as a mechanism to fight opponents
Sophia Maholela,"Simphiwe
Sydwell Phakula,Morning guys "That will never happened SA should learn to take hash decision & arrest all the corrupt people "Nissan CEO in jail now so Who is funding the Zondo commission? All Parliamentarians are pathetic lairs When are they arresting in the latest discovery & stop deceiving us here????? i see the SAPS police in uniform are they there for arrest or what? Truth hurts you know that most white ppl never admit that they do not like black ppl
Speckled Trim,Any news on any important arrests? "I think they design this process to delay justice and spend more money "Parliament lied during votes of no confidence like the PP's recommendations that were thought to be non-binding while more billions were stolen. there's probably more new capture taking place right now Lied under oath by default He looks like he is trying to convince them with his eyes why is he mumbling now?
Not Your Business,RAMAPHOSA TO ANNOUNCE CABINET RESHUFFLE AT 3PM ðŸ™„
Mkhululi Bushula,@Sam Vanguard u talk about threat to our democracy but u comfortable under the apartheid regime which was autocratic it nature. Are u talking white property. Bcs black ppl didn't own any property under apartheid @Sam Vanguard black ppl did not own property under the apartheid regime. @Sindile Dinabantu are u refering to those native yards. U call that property. @Sam Vanguard why did u run to your big brother Donald Trump if u are so prepared for any combat. @Sam Vanguard but u said didn't need any protection. U are suffering swart gevaar syndrome. If u prepared u should not be globetrotting spreading lies. Your case of defending stolen land. Thanks Keith for that info. Khoisans are Africans That's how u have been distorting history. We will take it back. The problem with u white folks u don't want to be lead by black ppl u still nostalgic of the apartheid days. No u have a problem to be led by black person. @ Fick Liebenberg your choice of leaders is very interesting. Obama and Maimane lot of similarities. We don't Carr what u say. it's accounting irregularities or anticompetitive behaviour not corruption a superior race can never be corrupt it's an honest mistake.

KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"@Louis Eloff My fellow citizens "@Mkhululi Bushula No "@Mkhululi Bushula Perhaps @Desmond Masilela How has he been since they started this morning? BREAKING! Pres. Ramaphosa is expected to announce changes (Reshuffling) later today! "@Desmond Masilela Great man @Desmond Masilela Around 3pm i think "Wonder who's going to be chucked out...

Marvel Ramatshela,Zuma wouldn't mess up if he didn't have support from ANC "R56 billions wasted by government departments "I still think this commission might be just another waste of money. our law enforcement agencies are not effective

Genevieve Pilz,@Sam Vanguard Asking Israel for rifles again? @Mkhululi Bushula He's going to farm in the snow in Russia for ten rubles @Sam Vanguard Men and firearms are limited surely but I guess we'll see. Hope the verbal violence in this chat in general doesn't go anywhere Lol at sokkie braais The Chinese are very open about their racism so that's refreshing "@lee royal It's not entitlement. It's a combination of severe stupidity "@Tony Everts They only take actual asylum seekers or people with skills. Sorry I read SA is going to have really bad power outages over Christmas. True? @Desmond Masilela Without the racism there would be no chat @vuyo hlahla did somebody sort out a racist chat? @Desmond Masilela apparently eNCA is better? I'll have to see

Fick Liebenberg,@ Tony you are right... I thing some wight people do have a issue with a Black leader. But it is not all white people. I would support someone like Musi or Obama no problem... But CR is doing great work right now. I might even vote ANC if they start prosecuting the VBS looters and the Corrupt leaders.. I would never ever vote FF+ and never ever National Party. I would love to live in a place where people are judged by their actions and their character. No what I say is if people do the right thing. I will vote for them. a Political party is not a soccer team. You don't stick with them if they keep losing
Cain Chunda,two thirds majority to continue to loot with impunity! my vote ain't available "great work by CR in aiding n abetting WMC thando like to think we're fools n can confuse thuggery by the ANC for rainbow nation. keep chasing the illusion of a rainbow both literally n figuratively while we fight for land justice
