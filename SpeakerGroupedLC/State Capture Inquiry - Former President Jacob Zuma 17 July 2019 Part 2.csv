Give a don’t know answer as usual JZ He’s debating with the Chair now. I’m surprised Skhakhane has not jumpyto his defense Zuma is not coming back... I can assure you. The chair must use his powers and subpoena him to finish his testimony qha. Zuma is doing what we expected him to do on Monday.... run away.

Pastor J.J,@Peet Venter .Brilliant my brother. You get 2nd Prize. Thando got the 1st Prize this morning @Thando Nkutha @Bronx Wavy Absolutely. They must amongst many others be prosecuted to the fullest. @goolamv . I believe u bro. everything about the EFF is fake. @Thando Nkutha Get back to work my Brother. The BOTS are back. Wine later @Lex Luger Welcome back my brother. I am still confused since monday. @Lex Luger I am actually surprised that it took him 3 days to do what he just did. It was discussed at lunch and this was so preplanned. This is no different to what has happened in trials already @Rainy Moodley In the case of Zuma it is and must be guilty until proven innocent. the allegations are overwhelming is it not? "Where is ""Fleetfooted"" Zuma?" @Simon Davies NO NO NO
siphamandla clement,JZ is innocent
Sthe Buthelezi,Are they back guys ?? yoh mara time and at 16:00 they will want to agend for a a day breaking news EFF has kickout on budget vote just now EFF is responsible on what happened to VBS

JCC TV,African time 😳😳😳😳😳😳
Lourens De Jager,i heard there is water restrictions around zondo from today they helping zuma with page numbers running running gone "if you're not guilty pay back the money and a full JO-JO tank of water ! lol "like he said 
Born free,I have faith in Ramaphosa and truly hope he can turn this country around and that State capture and corruption does not happen again. Zuma should know how a guilty person behaves afterall he was an MK Interrogator. With a surname like Beakus I think not Puppet or not he has alot to answer for. "This Commission is to establish how Agree with Simon If there is evidence in writing or Memos Zuma is in deep trouble. Proceed Please Please Proceed Zuma is used to dodging the bullet.. not this time . Yes.. Simon Beukes.. it's strange you make such a comment with a surname like yours?? Object please Mr Zondo Zuma is not going to continue with this enquiry. Judge Zondo will have to Supbeona him to the Commission in order to proceed. It was Zuma's lawyers that insisted they adjourn early not Zondo. Zuma will go and sing his machine gun song to his few supporters and maybe talk too much. Zuma will be subpoenaed And he will always have blood on his hands I think Gerald Beakus is Jacob Zuma 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Can Zuma recall all his wives?? So funny Gerald aka Zuma Cuff Zuma to his chair I guarantee they are done with the questions and Zondo will have to issue a subpoena. They are back This time it won't be an Invitation but an Order If the process is the same as it should be in accordance with the Constitution then Zuma should have no problem recalling appointments.
Simon Leepile,I can't see live what is going? @Thando thanks Thanks

Dominic Przybylski,I'm still waiting to see CR being a real leader. "My problem with CR is he was 2nd in command for five of the ""9 wasted years"" and takes no responsibility for it." He uses other people for memory. Is not his job to remember what he read? Isn't it a little strange that other people have a memory but he doesn't? Perhaps he needs a brain scan or psychological help. Perhaps he should spend a month at Valkenberg for psychological evaluation. "I ""would have never"" Why not say ""I didn't""?" This is classic behaviour of a guilty person. If he is complaining about being treated with kid-gloves just imagine what will happen when he has to go to court. The man realises that he is going to be proved to be guilty if he continues with testimony. He is giving up the opportunity to prove himself innocent - only conclusion can be that he is guilty. Put him in jail if he refuses to testify. Enough of the kid-gloves. If he acts like a criminal treat him like a criminal. He knows he'll be proved a liar when confronted with specific details. If he doesn't come back it is 99.99% certain that he is guilty. @Gerald Beukes What are you smoking? Can I have some? @Joseph Gumede waste """waste"" of time" @Philos Masina Very sad statement you just made. Rand is strong because everybody transferring pounds to rands before Brexit. """waist"" = line around stomach. ""waste"" = use carelessly." The only thing we have found out is what JZ doesn't remember. We do however know that he does remember things quite clearly which happened 30 years ago. Is perhaps symptom of smoking too many zols. Zuma will be going to Dubai very soon. Dubai - The quick sprint to freedom. Ultimately JZ must be tried for treason. He betrayed our nation. He must be arrested before he skips the country. "I always believed Zulus were proud and brave The man famous for singing about bringing his machine gun is frightened out of his wits by a few questions. NPA now needs to step up.
Thandeka Phakathi,what happen ......no live

SABC making Money off Live Streaming NOTHING Evidence leader Paul Pretorius says it would be unfair to Zuma if he did not put certain things to him where he has clearly been implicated by another witness. "I want my client to consider his position - I advised him to come here in bona fides and I do not think I was right."""

Siwakhile Matu,This Zuluboy always don't remember
fikile mbokodi,they are late as usual
mandisi ntauzana,guys what's happening "am rising also We are live This commission has a pre determined outcome to blame everything on Zuma "why is the commission in the business of cross examination of witness who has been called to provide information....... now the commission is cross examining him "Zuma came as a witness who will provide his side of the story to the commission "The commission if it wanted to cross examine JZ why didn't they subpoena him for cross examination and that would have open up JZ for them to do whatever they want "let DCJ draw any inference he wants
Lorraine Naidoo,I don't know .I cannot remember when they going to start 🤣🤣🤣😃
Sthakathi Khumalo,Zondo is disciplining Skhakhane I hear Skhakhane raised this but was told to sit down... it seems the commission has take a view on some aspects "But when he says no "He is saying "exactly "Thando Nkutha Refusing would have been digging his own grave Skhakhane must stand up now.. But he has a point guys... They have realised no comment is chowing credibility Zondo concedes Skhakhane is key bafethu!! Kwashuba Skhakhane is key!! "Skhakhane is correct "CHESS GAMES "Pretorius has been nervous the whole time because he knows "But Zuma has said nothing to be honest "nhlanhla nkosiExcept you of course "mandisi ntauzana well summed up "mdu ndlovu Gordan was telling us stories without detailed analysis of who said what "Talent P Sibisi Kushubile bafo Are we closing shop for today "Ewu Fairnes s Can they say something mx
Thozamile Yapi,All Rise He has been advised well someone realised that his sidestepping and I don't recall and all that will not work here - because the commission may well take conclusions based on that - and it may not be in his favour... kwaaa! hehehe😂😂😂😂 here is my 2cents - His lawyers probably told him he will have to stand up for himself now - because they (lawyers) are being restricted by DCJ Zondo. hehehe aaaahhh "We are going to adjourn for today until tomorrow at 10:00
Precious Ntshangase,African time He was coached some more during lunch hour.... "I was looking forward to this week "So "@Pramodpatel Pramodpatel ..u said you are fom India.

Jessica Moremong,he sounds like his lawyer now he will never go to jail
Risuna Manganyi,"""expected to know"" !!!!" @Phumzile Mkhize we can shut it down...we know now that everything he says is exactly like that. hahaha The painful thing for me is the reality of having been once led by a leader who is not accountable for anything! It pains me that my life as a resident of SA was in the hands of this lumatic Mr Pristorius's emotional Intelligence is on steroids. I admire people in his position and can still act the way he does👏👏👏👏👏👏 that was a strategy from Zuma and his team why are people clapping?

Tebogo V,"@Bronx I fully agree with you but I'm also curious "White people still owe us @Bronx are you a fan of Julius Malema? @Bronx are you a fan of 'superior' logic & ideals of Julius Malema? 😂😂😂 Let's be clear there are no differences between Zuma & Malema His legal team has noticed that his answers before lunch were self incriminating @Bronxx give him power and he will be seating there in no time now he's busy with the not so small looting of VBS but honestly guys how did we end up with a president like this? Sikhakhane does not argue the law he argues emotions How did we end up with scum like this as president @Ntokozo we do not care about his Zuluness or anger he must just answer the question Amazulu think their ethnicity is Starbucks coffee @Ntokozo what is a cross examination? Fact is Pretorius has no prior knowledge of Zuma's version of events unlike his counsel so he has to ensure that what he says is unequivocal Zuma's concern is he is entangling himself in a web of lies because his concern is Lies not tell the truth Sikhakhane is no lawyer but a sophist with very low emotional intelligence "Sikhakhane uses flowery language that really means nothing Pretorius must ask those difficult questions if he has nothing to hide he would have no problem answering Cross examination happens to someone whose version is already given In fact his I don't knows and I don't remember have already incriminated him Pretorius must go harder if he has nothing to hide he will give his version Zuma doesn't take us serious "It's best that he goes "It's not like he enjoys the privileges of provocation alone Zuma was not a king of the Zulus he must account "His actions had dire consequences on the fiscus he can't just run away like that What is the financial state of Transnet today We don't hate Zuma but we hate his unthical & corrupted character @Sandile better than you who is under the spell of Zulu nationalist PROPAGANDA "Zulu nationalist PROPAGANDA is dangerous If Zulus were committed to this country IFP would not be among the top parties in SA "@Sandile trust me I do and by the way the Sipho Maseko Zuma rejected is what in Black Consciousness we call a TOWER Sipho Maseko is a product of Black Consciousness movement thus a tower I.e he ascribes to the highest ethical values in service of his community Zuma is a stooge of Guptas "Check Sipho Maseko's background he is a TOWER "I am a disciple of Biko and Sobukwe Zulu Nationalism is dangerous ZUMA REJECTED SIpho Maseko a TOWER who was groomed in the BLACK Consciousness movement to always be ethically upright Y'all Zulus are victims of IFP ideology that killed people in Boipatong & Thokoza Zulus can't think beyond narrow Zulu ethnic consciousness In fact Zulus are the problem in this country together with Boers otherwise IFP and VF would not exist Amazulu and their narrow nationalist ideology are a problem @Thando truth must hurt even more Zulus will support anything whether is right or wrong just because it was done by Umzulu Daai khehla isgebengu @Phumla truth hurts Zuma became president using nationalist zulu ideology I.e @Herman cannot see right or wrong if the person is Zulu If Zuma is found guilty he will try to use his zulu identity to mobilise to stay out of jail Zulu Nationalism may even lead to a national confrontations between Zulu loyalists and those who want to hold Zuma accountable @Buyani I'm telling the truth @Thando block me but you heard the truth "@Buyani crooks be they green The fiscus is nearly on its knees due to actions of Zuma and his friends at the SOEs he must account Zuma was not a king but head of a democratic government so his actions and decisions must be scrutinized Imagine supporting a criminal just because he is Zulu or Black Nothing wrong with the commission but everything wrong with a witness who does not want to tell the truth @Talent ga ke kwe sezulu Judge Zondo is soberminded unlike most of you suffering from Zulu nationalist PROPAGANDA "Zuma must account to us Citizens "Imagine if all South African ethnicities had a political party mobilising on grounds of ethnicity Zuma will go to jail Zulu or not Biko taught us to aspire to the highest ethical standards of leadership in service of our black communities not be disgraceful like Zuma Biko said we must be ethical TOWERS Zuma stole from the poorest black citizens @Mrs Anderson Zuma and his friends have been perveting black consciousness for too long it's time to out them It's shocking that we had a psychopath like him as president for 9 years "Julius is Zuma in training "Amazulu zuma stole our money and we will hold accountable niya thanda anithandi

Nelson Musoliwa,My point is Zuma must not worry about what have been said about him; let him disapprove their evidence but stating what he knew to be what actually took place Zuma must just explain what he know happened than complaining about what other witnesses testified about him This guy is real a delusional fellow Zuma can not understand that it is too late for him to run nor to hide; he must just face it up and account Boipatong tragedy is some of the prize our people were called upon to pay to usher in our freedom so we cant compromise it guys Zuma need be subpoenas to be cross examined or he be left out of this commission for law agencies to handle him "Me think the commission must leave Zuma

Thato Thulare,Let's bare in mind that this is more about corroborating what was said vs his version of events. It is not cross examining when asked to give your version for the record. #DEFLECTING It's becoming more evident that JZ was a passive president because he clearly cannot go into any details of any sort because of fear of incrimination. #BS So what exactly is he here for? Coz everything here seems to implicate him in some way. I'm struggling to understand which questions are appropriate for this man Classic hear-say. Concrete evidence needed here. Coz clearly Zuma never made illicit decisions during his term right!!! Or any decision for that matter "Entlek SA We are a very long way from a guilty verdict peeps! I just don't see it in the near future. No alignment here. No no no. That is not a South African. In SA we discuss your guilt before the judge does and analyze it further even after your guilt ahaha! "Bwahahahahahaha. ""As a matter of fact "No we have to talk about it coz it feels better. In truth nothing here will influence anything. But alas we just have to talk about it. Don't hate

Jabu Malinga,zuma and trump. best dodgers out ter lol. som ppl r soo desperate to watch this heheheheheheheheh zuma wil say nothing zondo wil decide who is lying. he wil make recommendations and zuma wil go to court . another 10 years wil pass. zuma wil die and then? all this money? they r not coming back zuma wil not answer he is too clever for that either zuma is lying or Barbara Hogan is lying. take your pic.. zondo wil not supena him they wil not force him to do anytin. zondo is neutral zondo cannot act in 1 interest over another zondo wil hav to do what zuma wants "if zuma does not want to answer "zondo invited zuma . he did not com by force the commission can now make findings even if zuma does not answer "zuma has his opportunity "300mil builds 3 rondavels "with the money spent on Nkandla npa wil do nothing npa did nothing all this time. who have they arrested? the npa cannot even get the mpisanes to account we do not no what deal zuma struck with ramaphosa. this is just smoke n mirrors when is npa turning around? shamila has been there for a while now is shamila still settling into shaun the sheeps office at npa or what?
Martin De Beer,Agreed @Joseph Gumede . Nothing going come from this like all the other commissions. Not even one charge after how many years?! Leave all this proceedings and nonsense - move to court. Charge formally and let the evidence or lack therefore speak. *thereoff "Gerald Beukes had to only memorize 1 line. Well done
Njabulo Mashinini,The lawyers see that he is not recalling anything and that makes him guilty they want to pull him out but will he live the commission? Why its impossible to bring guptas into this inquiry?

Coward @Zuko Sirayi I'm with you. @Pumeza Mnguni Hee hee hee hee @Thando Nkutha His day in court is coming soon and then he won't be treated as leniently. He's been handled with kid gloves here - we need to use the boxing gloves. Take away his passport quickly. "@Thando Nkutha In Zuma's case Run coward run! @Thando Nkutha I'm not going to argue with you. @Tebogo V He'll use every trick in the book. He has no problem throwing anyone uder the bus to save his own skin. @Nonto Ngubane Zuma is too much of a coward to give his side of the story. @Samkelo Nxele I agree - down with tribalism - that's an apartheid tactic. @Lebohang Mathibela 😁 @Moses Ntuli I agree - that's just a distraction tactic. No place for it. @Nonto Ngubane Sorry? Run that by me again. We need to treat our political leaders like public servants who are accountable to us - not like rock stars. Run Zuma run. Run like the coward you are Zuma. @Felix Muyoba Nope - the judge will then decide which evidence he believes to be true. Run Zuma - hee hee hee hee @Samkelo Nxele Of course he's a coward - he's been running from justice for decades. Just like he's doing now. COWARD! @jpleroux24 Yeah - he's asking the Guptas for guidance. @mdu ndlovu You're right - I have no respect for Zuma at all. Coward @Dave Sinclair He was being treated too leniently. Zuma is holding the whole country to ransom yet again. He must just be put in jail. I kept hearing these stories of what a brave man Zuma is. Now I know that was total BS - he's nothing more than a coward. Left with his tail between his legs. @nkululeko sogula Zuma ran like a scared dog.

Ketelo Asanda,"Well I hope he takes the right decision here. A president for 2 terms and you do not remember anything. This man needs to use this platform to say something clear and to the point. I for one do not know what he knows and it's been 3 days.
GCINIFA SIBIYA,😁😁😁😁Zuma
Charlie Komape,zumas defence lawyers have failed to prepare him adequately for the hearing.Using i dont know or i cant remember as a defence was poorly thought; did not negate allegations against him. watch the space the lawyer has advised zuma to abandon ship. "commission is not the place for lethumshini wam  considering the amount of information shared by those alleging corruption on his part; he should have been better prepared to refute these allegations.Thus far he has said nothing. stop this tribal stupid bickering its divisive chaile time not coming back. now is the time for the hawks to strike; there is evidence of wrong doing at this commission to prosecute.
