KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,@Thompson Masilwane Serious problem hey but thats politics. Just hope the global markets will not panic. The rand has been so strong past days @Siseko Davani Impeachment from the 500 000 that this PP is using to discredit CR will not work. Ramaphosa will not go anywhere ...agree @Siseko Davani yOU Malema said so? @Siseko Davani How's this Malema guy think? H'es unbelievable crazy populist that is always on the lookout where he can benefit gain popularity @Siseko Davani She is also a Zuma and Ace puppet hey. I said so during the Adhoc committee meetings or interviews for this PP position. She was avoiding any question about Zuma. She couldn't answer such questions clearly "@Antonie Goosen SARS seized most of his property "@Musa Bakiti hE must pull out "Adjourn LOL oH WOW! "@Thabani Mthethwa lol. yOU THINK SO? they protested to take a break I see the RAND is now strong again!!! "The rand was 0.071 earlier Mr Pretorius musn't ask tough questions to Zuma @tau thinane LOL...A big fish !! @Antonie Goosen He will comeback cause his stupid lawyers may have thought they might end up in trouble @Bernard Mangava You can't blame Mr Pretorius cause Zondo did not see any problem with the questioning """IT WASN'T MEANT TO DISRUPT THE COMMISSION."" HEHEHEHE!" I mean their objective was to disrupt and delay progress !
Hilton Hawkes,""" ... he's the universal soldier Welcome back Jake 😁 @ MSG - correct "10 minutes to explain about subpoena powers
Born free,Actually it is more than R500K it is about the R51million donation from Bosasa which is under investigation Donations to the ANC stolen from the State Entities which are financed by the tax payer. So ANC stole funds from it's government enterprises to fund it's own campaign. Stealing to donate is a crime Donations were stolen monies from SOEs Bosasa donations was from corruption and looting of unlawful tenders Thank you to the legal teams for reaching an important compromise 👏 well this will help lead to those who captured the State owned entities. They should not have a lunch break so much time is wasted already you can catch the same fish twice Zuma and his team attacked Pretorius because he is white.. what a shame Pretorius has the right to cross examine there were no mistakes made here Delaying tactics
Dominic Przybylski,"Who will be next president in this country ruled by gangsters Let's just let Putin rule us from Moscow. Not easy to say no to money and become billionaire at same time. "What we need is your ""honesty"" mister Zuma." "They counting on using next few weeks to ""fight back"" using PP and ANC secretary general." War is on.
Mandy Pannack,country will fall into huge crisis if President Ramaphosa is impeached. please let's pray that doesn't happen
Phindile Mbonani,@ Talent P Sibisi uZuma uzwilakhe.
Musa Bakiti,Comrades Ramaphosa is not helping our agender .He has to go @peter sikoshule If you are black like Ramaphosa you must learn to say no to money.😂😂😂 Comrades lets get fruits as our donations not money What happen to arms deal? Zuma is pulling out. Replace Pretoriours with a black Adv baba expose whiteness baba
Teboho Lebenya,Zuma uryt yazi zuma mase ulandela kahle uryt akukho okubi ngaye.
peter sikoshule,"but guys he didn't steal it. all political parties received donations guys donation is not theft "nkululeko for now lets focus on donation thando any amount of money is a donation is channeled to donation account
Antonie Goosen,The ANC will merely replace Ramapokker with another puppet The ANC is the mafia in SA "Malema just as corrupt - why do you thing he got away with tax evasion?  ...but this was agreed the other day...?? Skhakhane must be happy - more billing days for him Zuma will p... himself under real cross examination Zondo really earning his money lol I will buy bread if he comes back ..or KFC... "...anyone ugly MF - can smell him from here all the guilt stuck in his throat by 10:30 Monday Zuma will object again
Talent P Sibisi,@Phindile Mbonani wenzeni sisi uZuma noma nizwa ngezitha zakhe uthi weba imali. @Siseko Davani uMalema ixoki lathi lizomfela uZuma omunye lowo owuZwi lakhe and mzwane waphatha sobe sizwa ngaye ngisho siya e-Toilet mnxn Lento eyenza uZonde uZuma iyekenje leyonto iyeke Mr Zondo and Mr Zuma I respect them ukuba ngangingayena uMzulu ngangoba yini kodwa Ooh Nkosiyami @Siseko Davani kwaaaaaaa Ngiyabonga Zuma ngoba awucala yinga uvumile ukuthi uzokhuluma baphi abathe ngeke ubuye mnxn If this is a Joke why u here? Show is over go home guy's. King Zuma uyindoda bukanje sebezwe ngawe. wiNdoda Zuma
Tebogo Mukansi,when are they resuming
Kabelo Katjedi,"Any political party to lead SA will be at fault bcs they all receive donations for their campaigns from different institutions.Lets put Eff or DA  "He is amongst the richest bt steal receiving money illegally "Lets adjourn until further notice This commission will work in his terms Im sure he heard the news of Ramaphosa and he wnt to throw under the bus "We might blame zuma or his counsil bt there is no way they cn allow any person to undermine them. Pretorious should understand every 1 read the same books as him "Like every south African Zuma is entitled to free treatment or whatsoever
