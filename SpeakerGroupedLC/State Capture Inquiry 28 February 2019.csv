Magda Seguin,Judge Zondo became aware of the Bosasa issue and had it remo ex last week *removed PFMA = Public Finance Management Act Mabilula was informed by the Guptas that he will be made Minister During Mbeki and Manuals terms SA was economically sound as the biggest in Africa now it is the third He is Coloured...his daughter went to school with my daughter Some people believe propaganda @Thaabit thank you "2009 Zuma was introduced to the Guptas in India by Aesop Pahad I agree...Bell Pottinger is redundant but their nominees are still used for nefarious purposes...they were paid millions with tax money That's it!...Aesop Pahad must come to testify...he knows the Guptas very well @ Francoise Phillips and recently Venezuela Chavez nationalised everything and look at what is happening in Venezuela...no food or meds...hospitals are like squats and 3million refugees from Venezuela in Colombia and elsewhere Those EFF voters who think nationalisation of the Treasury and Reserve bank are being led up the garden path Problem is he was appointed by the Guptas bypassing the Constitution Some people REALLY don't understand what hearings in commissions are about This is not a side show or a movie for distraction...stop commenting nonsense The WC has the lowest unemployment And the govt want to get rid of older people with experience and integrity Who should provide training and mentorship? Great stuff Mr Manual Some people only like sensationalism...not sense
Matome Ramphele,Hi @Thando Nkutha 😃
Indoda Yamaqiniso,Why is he out of sync? "This is strange "I'm not asking you "This is a man who privatized almost everything Rupert's PFMA As much as you do. And you're stil lurking here.

Don't undermine my intelligence😂😂😂 "Even if he can says so "This commission is not about poems "Even if you can write in small letters A beast eyes... Oh shame.

King Solomon and the Pharaoh's were black people "By that time Europeans were still crawling in the icy caves of Europe The Black Moors saved the whole of Europe from the dark ages. "Sub-Saharan blacks? Blacks have been all over Africa He looks scared. He knows something coming that we are not aware of. ...

The Xilaman,Who is this fils de home you guys keep replying to. He doesn't appear in my feed 😂 Witnesses must be kept secret till they testify For their safety 3100 people watching Or listening This is the highest number ever By the time this s done Zuma will be 80 and he will still have to go to trial. That's another 3 years. And only a different party will have the political will to arrest JGZ after this commission. ANC will stall because de tractors will why they didn't arrest De Klerk and other people involved in apartheid project. Add the construction companies into that Why did mbalula cry? So Mbalula didn't want the Guptas involved in government? Add? He come the blf Block He is the Chancelor of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology CPUT They might. Later 😂 Yes. Pliable to his goals Took people long enough to see their true stripes State Capture started in 1652 but In that case I will say it started right after The Anglo Boer war. Go watch Verwoeds speech Being moved from sport to police May weather 😂😂😂 No true African of African descent would let SA sink. Perhaps it is your disconnection to this land that allows to give up on South Africa and Africa so easily. There is always hope that SA will see a better day. Patriotism needs to be taught to young South Africans That's why these scum bags steal money meant for all of us and primarily the poor Google it "I don't meant nationalism I saw you swear at other people by their mother. I won't engage you Nationalism tends to be associated with quite nefarious actions Evil in fact It's the incompetence State capture isn't only about guptas.

Wildthing,find that person camera man The whole 2010 WC must be reviewed lots of donations for poor development went into the wrong hands. someone needs to do a full audit. from day one going into how long the money kept coming in "just think of it. for instance if the Cape Town stadium was build large enough to be used correctly for Soccer it's like watching a Chines Kung Fu movie for Rugby maybe but what about athletics. build a track inside but CT stadium should have been build bigger in the inside to fit the rugby field in correctly and should have been planned and discussed before WC10. but they would not because of the money stealing Indoda not sure how Rupets come up here it's all on paper Zonda when the first arrests happening. I would pay to see Fearfokkol get arrested. just to watch him cry. ha ha treason would be just one charge. accepting stolen money. corruption. cassing harm to SA. race card is now old does not work over used. we looking now at wrong and right Thami agree they need to take action now. John both Kevin is from Cape Flats it's not Stienhoff but Joost. once he is found guilty he will pay for.it. Stienhoff will also get a big fine for letting it happen. no compliance in place. all people lost in Stienhoff. we all lost Mzala they in the same whatsup group listen to that its true Dludlu Zuma would not listen to that candles

Niematullah Rakeep,I do not find it strange that Cheryl Carolus also pops up at the Commission. althose who have vested interest and who enriched themselves at the expense of the poor are all there to cover their tracks They did not give it away to Indians. Indians tried to take it away from whites. or they also wanted some of the Pie Thuli was the main puppet Clever Trevor...he wants to appear clever. Clever Trevor is certainly trying to mislead the Commission. He must just speak the truth. I think the Commission expect too much of this Clever Trevor who acts only in the interest of Rothchilds Slim vang sy Baas Thusfar everyone that testified was doing something to cover for something else. None thusfar implicates Zuma directly. Billions has gone missing. qhwrevdid it go? who benefitted? Yirre? BEE? BEELionaires? Not even Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment BBBEE 😏 Destroying records? what has this got to do with Zuma stealing money or taking bribes from the Guptas? He continuesly trying to mislead the Commission. clever trevor was Part of ANC IN GOVERNMENT No wonder Maria Ramos became so rich Gordhan will also be exposed. Just watch this space.

WorldofTanksRaw,"@Xola X The Xilaman ""Patriotism"" LOL! Love how you steer away from nationalism. Probably because you have no nation identity in your history." "@Xola X The Xilaman No one could have ever expected or forecast the incompetence that came with the government that came from the masses. 1994 - the year South Africa was converted to a banana republic. Here we are 25 years later listening to the confirmation of this fact. "I say the masses voted for this and therefore deserve the poverty @Indoda Yamaqiniso..are you talking about sub-saharan blacks? That's different to Egyptians. In fact Egyptians used them as slaves. Black people in SA are still being subjected to western laws that govern our country and borders installed by the colonialists. That can't be right?? Tribal culture - people serve the chief. Democracy - the chief serves the people.
