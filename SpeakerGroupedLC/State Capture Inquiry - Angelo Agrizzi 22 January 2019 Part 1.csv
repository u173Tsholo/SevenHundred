To break down is easier than what it takes to build up Whites need to be involved with the governance of this land because they built it and they understand it's inner workings to make it successful But it must be diversified to suit everyone with LAW & ORDER in place with prosecution without that you have nothing.

Telkom is partly privatized and probably the only reason its not bankrupt and needing bailouts (unlike Eskom @Sammy Best what guarantee do u have the EFF won't keep it all for themselves and connected friends? @Sammy Best u mean like the Zim government gave the land back to the Zim people? Sadly NO. "‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó""According to the report EEF will nationalise everything... and keep it for themselves and connected friends
mochaki kenneth,EFF is alternative solution now
Michael Michael,i think this man is telling nothing but the truth. with this kind of corruption black people will never succeed indoing their business. this is not the platform to defend our political organization.corruption is corruption regardless of who do it. waiting for someone to explain the amount of phone grabber i doubt if 2 years is enough for this commission even if anc win election by 90 percent majority.we will never allowed them to take land or farms that are producing food for the country.never. the great Agrizzi can the honest bishop circled by drug lords??? 50k and billions really he poketted billions after the house .really bcz of him lets tell them isvtheir last five years if they dont utilize if properly lets kiss and say ....... yes absolutely Maimane he is not ready to be the president. wt EFF?? never he dont understand y we must pay tax. we have kids .we can change it to orange country Mti former Correctional head.he is genius.i think he can be a corruption pricipal.best match with Watson. guys my heart is bleeding wn i think about that Vincent.for to be bribed.he must go to eskom.his office is there.

I'll vote against the Nazi's at EFF and I'll vote against he Nazi's at afriforum. Voting for the EFF is the same as voting for ISIS @Muzi Musamariya I see you left EFF off that list.
