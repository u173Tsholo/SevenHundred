Scottie Miller,"This country need to think expansion not implosion the ANC Racism is not something you change like a light bulb it takes time Whites have already agreed to try and change but it will only truly be gone in approx 50 years time that is the blatant truth. To break down is easier than what it takes to build up Whites need to be involved with the governance of this land because they built it and they understand it's inner workings to make it successful But it must be diversified to suit everyone with LAW & ORDER in place with prosecution without that you have nothing. "If there is no law there will be no success does not matter from which angle you approach it Russia and China are embracing Capitalism why Communism does not work never will the end result of every communism state is Dictatorship I will not be part thereof and definitely not my children.

Sammy Riddle,😵 BEE policy should just be removed. We can plainly see it can be manipulated and it prevents much needed international investments "Guys "The EFF has a few points that cannot be ignored "However The ANC is only allowing land reform to discreetly disperse the land it has been collecting under the current land reform laws without people noticing they had it in the first place. It always amazes me that when a black man/woman is successful the first reaction to it is always 'white people are behind it' such little faith in your brothers and sisters

Ricky Mvana,this is wastage of our time nx no one is going to be prosecuted here
Delight Dizza Mpofu,Eff wont win elections
hans oosterloo,how do u claim eff and anc are such kind loving parties yet promote hatred against whitesv . we are all south african and love this country . politics is about country not people lesiba you are really from another planet . you were not there how can you prove land was stolen . so you say steal it back . wow thats typically a crime too..... how did malema escape his tax fraud ...through money laundering or honesty "sammy i agree . we need unity 
sikhosonke sixolo,"Lol true Ricky Mvana it's just waste of our time DA will be just the same lol "Vote ANC the people who killed black where never arrested. and secondly Money is an asset that can be fixed in time Viva ANC Viva

"Principles of The EFF make them a stand out.....DA is more private....anc no direction state in china is owning all the land china is number 1 political babes still screaming vbs .....EFF has asked who so ever hav proof to show up.....since
Mphumelele Sian Mbende,corrupt people will vote this A.N.C whch is distroying the country but we need change Vote E.F.F on the DA flag they specifically tell you that they dont car about balck people
Wildthing,just like Zim That's why Malema buys fancy things like Gucci and watches all owned by the people you talking about. how smart is he. EFF have proven they will do the same as the ANC and that is due to VBS. and that is just one that we know of. Mojela. shame don't you know how to go out and makr a life for your self want everything for free. it takes hard to work to succeed. ask Herman of the DA Nic why you hot a Greece name Ha ha Ha ha now the WC 2010 comes in Africa needs death penalties for corruption. This is all indirectly linked to BEE and AA. Remove people with the knowledge and place people in there place with out knowledge transfer and teaching. needs to be investigated too. the damage it caus
Muzi Musamariya,EFF must rule this country because is only a rightful political party to for Rise and Shine EFF "all ruling parties like ANC Zanupf  vote for EFF viva EFF zigi yes i agree with u and also indians must prepare to go back .to leave Africa alone rise Black africans rise
Mathome Samuel,which money
Hannes Toerien,@Nicodimus Mojela Must be nice living on the money of those destroyed by VBS @Nicodimus Mojela The EFF seem to know as much about VBS as the ANC knows about state capture. @Nicodimus Mojela I'm a people supremacist. I'll vote against the Nazi's at EFF and I'll vote against he Nazi's at afriforum. Voting for the EFF is the same as voting for ISIS @Muzi Musamariya I see you left EFF off that list. Interesting choice. @Albert Choene Vote for the Dagga party. They gave us legal weed.
Makwa Choma,Which party to vote for?? Tired of ANC turning our country into another ZIM Eff anc kebana bamotho from same womb DA is the best by far DA is best by far is just whites Nicodemus or wrong Last leader of National party joined ANC Martin us van wyk Albert which is that party?? Hahaha Sammy is now that we wake up about land PAC told us on first democratic election n said Land first all shall followed n what did we say EFF is too annnnngrrry to my liking No party better adviced us about land than PAC EFF is land opportunities party I think of throwing my vote away to DA but white people make me shiver I respect EFF for what they did by exposing Zuma n educating south africans about parliaments n many more but too annnnngrrry to govern
Modimokoane Brendeline,Im voting EFF this year
Sfiso Ngwenya,mmm that's why other ANC NEC members including Zuma didn't want Cyril to become a president bcoz they knew that the fire is coming. here is Agrizzi singing now. "aybo we can't vote for idiots EFF

Sammy Best,EFF is the only solution for Africans to recieve what belongs to Africans the land is all we need to conquer for 25 Years under ANC but we are still servants of white monopoly when will we have ownership of the land "PAC is no longer existing  shaka said it bcos they lacked education not like today How long will it take Africans to own the land if we still cant see reality from EFF Sorry Buyiswa Thy have been given enough chance is time for Change EFF is not planning to misuse the Land like ZIM but to distribute equally to all South africans i found it strange that there are still blacks who cant see that we need EFF for a better SA what a shame I found it so strange that there is still people who cant see that we need EFF for the better SA Lets Give EFF a chance for a change
Anthony Lovindeer,EFF For the Future Its about time the African Leaders start to control the wealth of Africa for the benefit of the people.
