Derek Main,@Thami Ngwenya We've heard nothing yet - just Zuma wasting our time with his wild and paranoid conspiracy theories. Glad he's dropping names though. I love seeing the rats back-stab each other. Zuma is seeing movies in his head. @Adam Maseko Ajay? Is that you? @Patrick Putle Zuma needs more than a chance - he needs a miracle. What a coward. Still running away. @Hard Right Turn Say what!!?? No thanks - count me out. @Mazwi Mnguni Yopu don't believe that BS do you?

"All those that came before Zuma were not given prior questions 2018 already It is Skhakhane's duty as the new Zuma's lawyer to make sure that Maseko gives over all the files. Its not commission's fault Who is this agent?? We are talking about documenst here...... That Mr Mantsha rubbish bin...😤😤😤 "It will be ''I can't remember'' for the whole week.

"Inquiry about him 3 comes after 2 listen carefully "I can't remember How could he run a country when he cannot answer such simple questions. sometimes his memory is clear... He doesn't know the difference between proper and improper.

Born free,Cyril Raymond a.k.a Ralph came under suspicion to being a police spy and died in ANC custody. Zuma is implicated in the poisoning and death of MK ANC Commander Nywenya/Thami Zulu (TZ) at an ANC base in Lusaka in 1989. Zuma was a useless intelligence Commander and stole funds from the funds of the MK Leave Trump out of this. Not because he is black but in all fairness he is as thick as a brick Trump is creating Victory to Trump 2020 This is going to be labourious I wonder if Zuma was born stupid or if he has always been that way 🤔 A useless President.. how embarrassing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣sweaty hands Brain dead

Sogodi Zalo,The fact that Skhakhane doesn't have documentations given to Maseko. proceedings should be dismissed. Both parties must have clear information that are facts on both parties. A one sided part is vague Most white people are commenting Pres Zuma is guilty. Racial injustice is a problem in this country. Let have prove and we talk after. in the meantime he is innocent. Has always been white people you are not better than anyone in SA. this thing of white superiority I can see on the comments. you are no better. the man was a president. Not a recording machine. He does not remember Rupert. Mandela. Mbeki were mentioned. Why are you all quiet???? Favoritism is a problem that's like 7 page of reading on the spot🙆
