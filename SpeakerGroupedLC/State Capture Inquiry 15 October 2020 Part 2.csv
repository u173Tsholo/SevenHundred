Mfundo,Si On lol waiting for Mr President "President Cyril Ramaphosa details economic recovery plan We are back from the economic recovery plan "Mr President said
Pastor J.J,Si off @zip reeper We could try that....hahahahahaha @zip reeper She sent me an SMS and I understand her frustrations. Sometimes these chats hit a new low. Often @Danie Nilsen Greeting Brother. None of us sleep well just thinking these buggers are going to come and steal the grass from the garden next. All the money is finish and klaar @Heather Durr Dont you worry Dear. The ANC has enough cadres who probably already have a plan in place to steal that money even before we borrow that 100billion @Mothokoa Kgobe 100% and we should not stop until things get better @Yolo More Well said Darling. @SanFran Arnold Didnt even know you was here. Glad to be in the presence of the team "@Danie Nilsen Very sadly that is our new reality my brother "@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee What does it matter anyway. Less than 1% of the votes will never ever give Juju any power @Sheperd Moyo very true @FieliesSA 100% well said my friend @Sanjay Maharaj absolutely. @Tay 100% and how Govt has fooled its people for 25 years and the people suffer endlessly "@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee It is very difficult and demeaning to support a bunch of crooks @Naledi Barron Welcom back Darling. I tried to fill in for you as much as I could but failed. Tea time for me @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee You are trying to create a reality that only exists in fantasy land @SanFran Arnold That kind of noise is often frustrating and keeps Clicks in business @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee I have now heard every angle of the angles and justification. WHAT ABSOLUTE NONSENSE. I apologise in advance for having said it but it had to be said @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee . I ask respectfully. Have you ever stolen anything in your life? Even 5 cents or a bubblegum? @Heather Durr That too. hahahahahaha. How did I miss that @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee 10/4. Over and out Leadership my foot. Juju cant even lead the dogs on a garden walk. @Sanjay Maharaj I wasnt talking about Floyd and the crew Bro. Thats another story. hahahahahaha "@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee You still have not answered my earlier question. Did you ever steal anything even if it was 5 cents @Light Revival54 You are forgiven my honest friend. hahahahaha @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee What I truly appreciate and respect is your strong views. I may not agree with you but I respect you @Sanjay Maharaj Brilliantly said Bro. 100% for you @Roza essack I would offer to donate my eyes to you but mine are also 83 years old my friend

SanFran Arnold,"Transnets standards were so low "Just like they used Linell in Eskom "The country is not ready to be led by a female president @summer de nobrega you are spot om *on "@Thabo Mokoaleli NDZ is zuma's ex wife. It would have been a ""carry on"" of his presidency" @Sheperd Moyo She would first have to be inclined to do so and she is not.. So there aren't any at the moment that would win an election in SA @Thabo Mokoaleli he is excellent in his field @Thabo Mokoaleli yes me too. He is a worthy candidate. @Thabo Mokoaleli problem is he is a partner at Bowmans "@Christopher Peters yes he is @Thabo Mokoaleli exactly @Owen Nyilika explain what?

Where were they now during cover for the poor. They only make news for race issues. Please they are a poor excuse for the poor. Laughable Also the EFF look after the poor like they did with VBS??? Please facts don't care about your feelings. @Naledi Barron no prob sweets. @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee again please look at facts. The EFF did not lay the first charge against the President. They did not cause the inquiry. @Sanjay Maharaj We live in a democracy and so I will have to go with that. I am sure if we lived in your dream world then we all would have been the change. The change is change in ethics @Sanjay Maharaj Ethics in our democratically elected government @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee they caused him to pay right??? @Roza essack hello Thank you Mr. Todd
Thabo Mokoaleli,"Yes "Female President NDZ is part of Zuma dynasty 🙈 "l am impressed with Attorney Chris Todd I so wish that DCJ can recruit Attorney Chris Todd to become part of his Legal team Siyabonga Gama is the guy that Barbara Hogan did not approve him but Zuma insisted that he wants Gama as CEO of Transnet 🤷 White Monopoly Capital is part of Bell Pottinger to deflect the RET people from seeing their looting. How one explain for a guy like Mosebenzi Zwane who is obviously chronically incompetent 🤷 "The RET brigade they use the term WMC for anyone who is opposed to their looting Bell Pottinger toxified Political Debate in South Africa 😭 "Bell Pottinger passed away in Britain last year
Pius Xashimba,Ramabosa thuma mina Running away with the money 💸💷💶🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ Zuma was silent but Mabosa was vocal🔊🔊 People listen 👂👂👂 Thabo bcs he has evidence and he is throwing them under the bus. At that time he wouldn't have🤘🤘🤘kasi Lengo Clevar

Matthew Van wyk,suggest a new leader for our country steenhuysen malema lecota who??? Todd makes a lot of sense Todd is worth his fees anyone following procedures today
Dumolwethu Sigwegwe,Zozibini will do
summer de nobrega,"its amazing to see that when a witness tells the truth Lindiwe Mazibuko has the potential to make a great female President.. @ZalisileNdzala They pulled out when they pointed out misconduct and were ignored "@Freddy Pummer Ms Molefe was very professional and a witness with much integrity "@Thabo Mokoaleli True. We were the rainbow nation until Zuma @jc No . the just doeaks with confidence and truth. no mumbling

Granny Mokwena,mkhwanazi must account
Hartsock_ZA,hmmm hmmm hmm hmmmm hmmmm
jwarha21,expect Mkhwanazi to say i can't recall Chairperson! Woza Friday... @Thabo Mokoaleli that is impossible because Mr Toddy was involved at Transnet and RET brigades will accuse him of playing both sides "@Heather Durr Few months remaining and Ace and stooges still not come to the Commission. Time is almost up and the commission is very slow Methinks "@Mandla J Ngubeni precisely the point but the Chief of the gang now wants Chair to recuse himself @Teunis van Ree which case now? "@Teunis van Ree Siyabonga Gama at Transnet and Brian Molefe Eskom two stooges of RET group @Zalisile Ndzala time is almost up for this commission and theres no point to have a witness like Todd so long "mr mayburg just say ""thank you"" to the chairperson"
Charles Maluleke,is Todd giving the commission some refresher course here? "@Zalisile Ndzala
Fred Desrosiers,I got the feeling he could have killed someone and stull would have been reinstated. "@Reikert "@Herman Tsebe "@Tay "@Russia Magezi I am ready for State Capture to fall on its head. "Remmember "Yes. A better politician "If you tried Zuma # "@Siphesile "@Thanda Sibisi In my view would have been better to get Mr. Todd's opinion on the other peoples affidavids after they testify. that would be more entertaining "@Maritime Studies Gama should pay the money that the High Court had judged against him.
Christopher Peters,Adv Myburgh also an xpret on labor matters.
Elwyn Schenk,It also obliterates you’re memory Your "All SOEs Special course on wholesale looting is run by ANC
Tommygun,"possibly the most important SOEs for a functioning state
Victor,@Thabo Mokoaleli This issue makes one get so angry DCJ thank you for knitting all these things together
Sekgololo Johannes,iyhoooo corruption Senekal can miss me It is simple; someone @ Union Building at that time did not want Mr. Gama out. It appears Transnet did all it could not to find Mr. Gama guilty and out It is strange
Anne M.,@Tommygun True. @Thabo Mokoaleli Correct. Bell Pottinger was appointed by the Gupta cronies to divert attention away from the looting.
Zalisile Ndzala,Throwing your clients under the bus when you have enriched yourself through them is immoral enrichment. "Lizard behaviour. When you were with Transnet You kept quiet then. This man is giving opinions. Let's move on. We wasting time. Which firm? @Teunis van Ree ...Financial Services Conduct Authority You are wasting time on Christopher Todd. You have enough factors. Call Gama to the stand. @jwarha21. Exactly. He is giving opinions. We want facts from the real culprits.

The Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi had eradicated poverty in Libya and they took him down The Economic Recovery Plan No. 20 Misremembering... @Sekgololo Johannes They were fully captured

The sad reality is that it was coming down to that for a while now... the EFF have been waiting for an opportunity like this for some time... @FieliesSA As usual... Todd seems to be having a great time snitching on everyone 😅 More people need to come out and expose these shady practices happening within institutions... "@cassim suleman True @Heather Durr Also he doesn't want to get shot around a street corner somewhere...

Thanda Sibisi,@Tay Not surprising given the circumstances @Luthando Xhamlayo. I do not think the stolen money can possibly be recovered. Some of it is invested outside the country. The best we can hope for is to start a clean slate with a clean government. @Penny Silima. Very difficult to say “Zuma made me do it” if he did not do it in writing and there is no documentary or audio evidence.
Hlagala Masetlale,@cassim I can't agree with you more. He is the man of integrity Todd this mkhwanasi must come and account to the chair he is master mind behind this nonsense @shepherd moyo but I don't think that what he's doing it's called engineering @william pieters if Mr Zondo become president this crooks will flee to Dubai

Its time we give Juju a chance he has worked for it" Juju has worked for it joking or not he has put the work in. Because we defiantly cant Vote DA EFF doesn't always do things with respect and honour but they speak the truth most of these issues are brought up by the EFF Juju was corrupt because thats what he learnt in the ANC. EFF are ones who bring things to book like or not. DA love to complain and use black people to win votes. "Im not a EFF fan but all these matters are brought up by JUJU . Juju is the future Dannie like i said Juju talks the truth he doesn't sugar coat things!! Juju was corrupt because of the ANC thats why he had a phuza face and over weight. EFF is the future "Mathaba "Sanjay  Even people who are in UK like B.M they watch whats happening in SA because of JUJU. Everytime when the EFF is Protesting or diong public talks people from around the world take notes and listen Lol there is a very big reason why people don't like EFF why? Because Juju brings things we don't like to the table!!! All these hidden things that are being done to our black people are ignored I don't like him but how do you ignore him B.M White? Even when Juju came to UK for a talk the whole place was full he gave a very powerful talk on the history and the problems of this country "Alot of our people don't like Juju but Juju is the one who brought Zuma to book and kept on persisting even in Parliament! If it wasn't for Juju  "Lol SanFran Juju is the future liking or falling inlove with a politician is like trusting your cat to be loyal to you its not going to happen  This State inquiry is happening because of who?? The EFF !!! EFF go to court and push and complain and hound . The EFF are very irritating because they fight for the poor not the rich!!! "EFF are like Hyena they never give up "This is SA  "I know we don't like EFF but poor people run to them and they raise important issues Juju works for his money whats the problem If it wasn't for the EFF we wouldn't have the State inquiry When the Nkandla is came up who pushed to the courts and made Zuma Pay? EFF When the corruption was getting out of had who runs to court ?? EFF Kapstaad this is SA where are u?? This info is known info My Pastor im not a EFF member but you can't ignore the work!! EFF removed Zuma through the pressure they gave!! Yes the manner they do this aren't the best but they are the ones who are actually work "Thank you my Pastor Light Revival this is SA people don't leave thier high paying jobs for nothing they leave because of EFF pressure!!!

Jenny Whitewaves,Malema is fooling the EFF and the people. Nothing done by the EFF unless it causes unrest and racial distrust to make the country ungovernable so that China can step in with a puppet in charge @ I think also that any part EFF may have ahd in getting rid of Zuma aimed at destablising the ANC and thus causing division Some pro Zuma Some Pro CR Some pro Ace to equal civil war @Naledi Barron Thanks EFF is the most divisive damaging fraction They are actively standing in the way of racial calm
