Epnet Streaming,Hellooooo anyone here? SAGA is right hehehhe You can tell how interesting this session will be by the lightweight lawyer they are using.
Pastor J.J,no. You are all alone Brilliance..... @Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona You are right. Standard 9. Any difference? @Gee Peex1 Is the N6 the name of a Freeway like the N1 or N2. He evntually did hit the Highway.hahahahaha @Gee Peex1 The man did not even pass matric. It is contained in the PP report. Where did he get an N6 from? @Gee Peex1 But you stated it as a fact. Now support it. Where did he get a N6 from? @Lorna Kavanagh Is it a fact the Domestic was arrested? or involved? @Lorna Kavanagh Yoh thats bad. But the news channels have not indentified anyone yet.Where did you see that part of it?Just interested @Cerebis A very broken and sad country indeed mt friend @Lorna Kavanagh Could it possibly be the childs Grandmother or Aunt? @Lorna Kavanagh Why so??? @Slindile Ngcobo True True. Just had a dark chocolate. Very tasty. @Gee Peex1 How did your N6 research go? Should we resolve to change it to N0? "@Gee Peex1 That was your ""get out card"" 3 weeks ago as well. If that is true just paste it again. hahahahaha" @Gee Peex1 .” A human resources manager at the SABC in 1996 told Motsoeneng that the fact that he did not have a matric certificate would be a serious hindrance to progress in the SABC. "@Gee Peex1 This was after an audit by Deloitte & ­Touche had found his colleagues regarded him as a “semi-literate journalist @Gee Peex1 The point is simple. You made a point that he has a N6 as a fact and cannot support it. Be real bro. @Lorna Kavanagh Read the post from @JS Bach .Is this a Domestic or Black persons you were referring to? @JS Bach Thanks for that update. Very sad indeed that we cant trust those that we need to trust @Gee Peex1 You may consider me to blind but I dont bulls88t people that I am highly intelligent if i am not.Try being honest friend. @Norman Zwane You are right my brother. Even some Pastors are doubtful these days @Derek Main . Thank you Derek. You are always straight and honest on all the chats. It irks me when people continuously state innuendos as a fact and cat support it when asked to do so. @x. .x Where are you bro? @x. .x Lots of nice places in Durbs bro @Born free I am now retired but I still Mentor and teach new Pastors into Ministry hi @Gee Peex1 Despite everything you are still loved by me. I have to remind you everyday @Thando Nkutha You are and will always be the first man I loved despite being married to my wife for 40years. @Thando Nkutha You are a fine and honest man with a lot of integrity. I do respect you a lot my brother @Danie Nilsen You are also loved Danie @funicanz We are sharing love in a sad and cruel world. You are also loved @Thando Nkutha I will and likewise my Precious friend @Danie Nilsen The thingy was with Dali Mpofu. Zuma was behind the killing of Chris Hani and the ANC knows that @David Foster You are indeed correct. However Sanctions and the like of it said many stories.

Avela Mdaka,Miss Pelay have so many diplomas
funicanz,"Ifundile le nzwakazi. Morning "@Diggo  Eish free state and its' judiciary. Hayi maan. Zondo is very perplexed @Thando Nkutha atleast this one is better than Ms Norman. She is calm unlike Ms Norman. "So JZ would will arrive late ^being asked questions. "@Gee Peex1  "When listening to this damning testimony "I get that "we are on the same page. I was merely responding to @Gee Peex1 who wants me provide proof of my statement which I did. Hlaudi was corrupt and he knew he was protected "@Thando Nkutha 
mafuta,curry @Gee Peex1.... lol I have never had the pleasure of meeting Mr Main. I am from KZN. @Derek Main haha...... maybe we met and we didn't even know it 😂
Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona,Hlaudi was incharge isintu no following of policies abeyinduna. Hlaudi was the SABC. 😂😂😂😂 Hlaudi is not grade 9.. the ancestors gave me degrees. stop saying he's grade 9. 😂😂😂 Hlaudi attended Gupta university . "hayi stop saying Hlaudi is not right in the head... he is a leader of a political party now he was angry when he got 2 votes. he said 'I voted for Hlaudi and Hlaudi voted for Hlaudi.' 😂😂😂 "@Derek Main "Norman Zwane "Diggo
gert pretorius,"😂 funny 
Nokbonga Nokxy,and the police must change and do their job very clean grade 9😂😂 welcome heyy
jeremia mphasawe,"hlaudi must be charged 😂 😂 😂
Kedibone Daniel,hey gys
Sabelo Mbatha,Hi ppl of SA lol N6 freeway😂 nokxy
makhosi nobhatyi,@ Gee Peex1 she is not scared of Hlaudi Motsoaneng was controlled by Zuma and Guptas Free state 😳😳😳 "Painting heist
Derek Main,Hlaudi is not right in the head. @Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona 🤣 Sounds about right for Hlaudi. @Cerebis Exactly - who needs to watch Malema vomit his racism. @Paular Sated Use the block facility and save yourself some frustration. @rwantsana ps I agree - it's an issue that has to be addressed. The Dept of Home Affairs has a lot to answer for. "@Hlamulo Evan Correct! There is no coherent immigration policy or it's not being implemented properly. Like so much else the ANC touches @Gee Peex1 Nobody asking for it to be stopped - we need some of the skills that immigrants bring. But the uncontrolled movement of foreigners into SA will cause more strife. It's not rocket science. @6.913.09 sixthousandninehundredandnine Quite ironic that you are raising this issue ON YOUTUBE!! @Gee Peex1 This must an issue that governments around the world are grappling with. Our government needs to do a better job. @Norman Zwane The grants system seems to be a hot-bed of fraud and corruption. @Norman Zwane That's the same modus operandi of the gangsters here in CT. @Gee Peex1 @Pastor J I'm with Pastor here - you made a claim and he called you out on it. Now you can't substantiate your claim. @Gee Peex1 Yes - I am. @Gee Peex1 🤣 Sorry bro. I'm sure it won't be our last run-in but it's nice to hear different viewpoints. @Norman Zwane Agreed - which is sad - there are many people in SA living in abject poverty. That grant is their lifeline. @Thando Nkutha It does seem odd that they are not paid for their work. @Gee Peex1 Thought they would have put him in a padded room by now. @mafuta Maybe one day. I went to school in PMB YEARS ago. @mafuta Stranger things have happened. @Huntley Cronje We suckers that are taxpayers pay for ex-presidents and their families for the rest of their lives. @Gee Peex1 Zuma definitely perfected corruption on a grand scale. @Antonie Goosen Of course - I am paying for all the cadres feeding at the trough. "@Gee Peex1 You'd have to be blind @Gee Peex1 Just because she didn't find evidence in one particular case that she investigated doesn't mean he's innocent. His time is coming. "@Diss & Dad Like I say "@Diss & Dad Every day
carnoth ngomane,"@Derek Main you are correct very true
Lorna Kavanagh,The female kidnapper of Amy-Lee was known to parents. This will add to the unemployment of domestics that is for sure. Glad to say kidnapping is a life sentence. Pastor J she was arrested EWN news said a female suspect has been arrested
Blessed Muya,hi gys
Lindokiuhle M it's lindoh,hope they talking about this human trafficking and this xenophobia going on we are not safe and this government is quite don't know what are they waiting for we are tired SA is no longer a country always a suspect😃😃
Cerebis,@Lorna Kavanagh Terrible It's a part of the vile abuse suffered by women in children in this broken country Not interested in the EFF presser! They are part of the problem in SA. Hopefully the On Point issue will now also be properly investigated as well as the shooting of a firearm at an EFF meeting by the Great Pretender.?
Slindile Ngcobo,paraphrase "@Jacob Zuma ...darker the chocolate @Gee Peex1 .....He is a Chairman not a Judge for this particular commission
Norman Zwane,"@Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona The 'two' voters who voted for Hlaudi are certainly not right in the head "@Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona How did Hlaudi arrive at 90% @Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona So the guys who were celebrating were celebrating the @African Refugee Blacc being a colour maybe? @African Refugee Black yes Blacc no @Gee Peex1 Ah so there is a way to control it. Our looters were busy taking bribes instead of thinking of a way introduce humane win-win controls. Few foreigners are without access to all SA grants. "@Shaun 21 People indeed under-estimate how corruption can morph out of money to Xenophobia "@Derek Main It is "@Pastor J Talking of TRUST "@Derek Main In the past
Mpangire Richard,Thats a sign of BACKWARDNESS. True tell him South Africans are known to be lazy without foreingners without Development in S Africa you like soft life only Moshoeu u had delayed to block Zuma ok
Buti Sipho,12h00 EFF presser
MAN-D Katelo,hello everyone here
Phillip Pule,fellow south african let us unite and fight those who looted our soes the way we fight immigrants
Bonisa Bonani,If Hlaudi came to this commission he would break the internet.
Dorothy Milne,"African refugee
Marie Viljoen,"MR ZUMA cut it. nobody wants to hear. see
Paular S.A,"who ever you are masquerading to be @JacobZuma 
R.S,just block him
rwantsana ps,for as long as the government doesnt do anything about immigration of foreign natoinal who are not supposed to be here only the legitimate ones should remain in this country the rest must go
muthu wa vhathu,Da day they stopped showing violence on TV is the day i stopped paying TV licence
Kopz Koape,Jacob Zuma...What's up player..Can u lend one million I'll pay u back Anc is controlled by foriengers it seems..Prostitutes are running this country SA is a gansters paradise
Moshoeu Mabusela,"I have blocked @Jacob Zuma @Kopz Koape. Let us come out with solutions. talk is cheap and is outdated. "@Chiss Joe. A better explanation is ignorance. That's why all other nations are occupying space with businesses @Huntley Cronje. Gravy train lost some wheels. be careful
Patrick Mavimbela,..follow it !!
Amadu Sy,matata
Tlou Chris,"tell u what! this is banana Republic
Hlamulo Evan,"South africa government is the one who let down their citizens
G T,"every single person that uses YouTube and Facebook daily are funding peadophiles in government "it's time that people started to show themself as worthy Now now Thando and Danie... Play nice!!
Kevin Simon,0.00333% That is percentage of the country's population watching online!!! Chiss Joe ​ running of the state and we are just watching? Where in the world has this happened. .. Try Russia!!!. "funicanz ​@Gee Peex1  In fact she'd been shot in the face using a pellet gun sometime before she died. Not condoning xenophobia but makes one wonder whether or not the foreigners are seeking a better like in RSA than what they have in their own home countries. Speaks volumes.
Shaun 21,it can be stopped once we oust corruption they can if they choose to the European union bounds their hands and even despite this italy greece and various other countries are now refusing and i dont blame them controlled immigration is what is desirable but our problem is pure unadulterated corruption his hands are bound friend wake up! no our border patrol agents and police take bribes we have problems with Nigerian cartels and all sorts due to this corruption and i have no doubt they are in with government as corruption drips down from the top the only solution is to stop and prosecute corruption at the highest levels and the fear of being corrupt will drip down from the top No we can properly enforce our borders and then check peoples credentials when they enter our country agreed thats our goal as people rather then focusing on the symtoms which the government loves we should focus on the source of the problem which is government our government love pointing fingers and detouring discontent during the struggle zuma ran a detention camp for unruly members of the struggle where some questionable things happened to say the least anyone of us caught doing such a thing would be in prison
Thulani Bukani,Well said @Norman Zwane
My View,This woman knows what she's talking about
Ambani Muilambudzi,just give 👤 an answer
Lindy Maweni,.
Chiss Joe,"The judge can comment You can't like her but you can appreciate her performance. "No Biased? Please substantiate...how is she biased? "My fellow south africans SABC should serve us not any party. It's a public broadcaster financed by tax payers money. Fraud in the private sector is bad but worse of is when the state steals money from it's citizens. "Why take somebody to the three Gupta brothers to be congratulated? Is that normal in a country with UCT "Guys "Its not about rich ppl "Yes But Zuma was president of South Africa how could it be that we were auctioned off. So the Gupta brothers paid off the corrupt guys from our own money...now that is hilarious. I'm also confused how a person can break into your house and than start feeding you from your own pots and you start worshipping the thief. "One day "Look at Thabo Mbeki "Did people join the struggle to come and steal? I don't know How could he have been a giant? That is a peddled narrative. Have you any literature about him being a giant? Forced to resign so that they could loot. Qunu? even my grandmothers house she build from the money she saved from selling umqhoboti is better. "I miss the real ANC of Mandela Rich country poor leadership "Isn't South Africa richer than the Emirates In terms of minerals
Danie Nilsen,it seems to me the judge is more strict on keeping with the comissions mandate and not want to listen to a lot of inuendos @Thando Nkutha if you go of on the already dead race card i will block you please lets keep this clean the white Hofmeyer why the white and just not advocat hofmeyer apolgise for what no she is a person and advocate then keep racial crap out of this then i apologise keep your part to plz i do to in an profesional way as there are a few others to but on the flip side some reale new ones only way to learn is on the job hey Gee Peex1 it did not just happened it was planned and engineered in advance with leadership at the top inside the beast was walking big fat lions and eating the country lean from a lot of angles at one stage when bosassa broke it was more like a pack of wild dogs ripping this country apart there might be some snippets left unless the hyenas was there first i do not want enter into politicks and religeon here but xenophobia needs to be adressed in both areas we need tollarance and also uhold the law uphold @x. .x lol had some beef bunnychow for ssupper and just now wiped the last @Rob Nel i realy do not know if it can be called that or if it is an organized exersise by some entity i must add that you can not excuse yourself from it though it was pay for work or do not get work ie contracts true no it is an cancerous way of making or atempting to capture the person same sa an spiders web munc curry at saxon world is like working as a hitman woman hitman for the mafia hi i a can understand poor unemployed stealing to food on the table what i do not get is goverment who is not poor and have employement steal from the poor let the love flow thats all that we need let the love flow so much in that one sentance and yet so easy to follow i will not do any bad unto others that i do not wish upon myself @Gee Peex1 i am in mourning to hear you say such utter rubish of winni she was a murderous cow ask stompy ask her so called soccer team who else she took out on her instructions
Born free,The ANC is governing as it were a One Party State. Hyhenas Now we know why farm murders and assaults are not reported on. It is the scavengers and wonga thugs that are using Xenophobia as an excuse to steal and loot. Hi Pastor J.. where do you have your sermons? Julius Malema 😉👍 India India via Dubai Guptas only became wealthy when they captured Zuma and the ANC I am confused Guptas and Watson amongst others captured Zuma and as a result the State was captured in turn by these people and Zumas ANC faction. I don't like my neighbor he is a wolf in sheep's clothing Gee Peex ..I hope you are being sarcastic. Mbeki was no saint. The money is offshore.
Huntley Cronje,Blindly respect ... the big problem! "Not at all Gee Peex1 - respect is amazing time for lunch - I am going to look for the gravy train wish me luck "@Moshoeu Mabusela - finished my little bit of leftovers from last night If you cannot put away money for retirement on a President's Salary - then you ought not to be there in the first place. "@Gee Peex1 - what
Mzalwane Mzala,It is wrong for BLF to have more coverage than the PAC. She is talking about the past 3 years is a long time in tech.

Antonie Goosen,SA needs to free itself from the ANC in order to really be free "Diss & Dad They are corrupt to the core Hope that you are?? Where have you been hiding the past 20 odd years ? Only Struggle is to hide the corruption haha "Derek - you also paying for the Watsons
