Dave van David,we now know guptas circle of lawyers 🤔😂😂😂 Always coming with Victim hood excuses... same strategy all crooks are applying... same Nkandla strategy 😂😂😂 why trying to defend van rooyen for giving his side of the story... try something else Masuku... Nkandla strategy of victimhood won't work this time around 😂😂😂😂 "Masuku is a clown... Derik Hanekom 1 - zuma 0 Remember..... The Strategy of NKANDLA team is to the render the Commission disfunctional van rooyen interacting with mkhwebane... report written by mkhwebane in 2018🤔🤔🤔 You are setting a very bad precedent Mr Chair.... that will disturb your smooth running of this commission 🤔🤔🤔 team gupta is under pressure here score 1- 0 spine is the back... spine is the back of the file...
makhosi nobhatyi,Who is writing these letters? I think it should be one person same format coz now secretary is pushing back These lawyers are wasting time ngoku Masuku doesn’t make sense coz his client is going to give evidence whether he start giving evidence or cross examination @Cain chuda I don’t see his inclination for his submission How can new minister not finds out how things has been done here then if there will be changes must happened later not first day I think Fuzile is going to make mistakes coz he is loosing his cool Van rooyen is a liar You see now cross examination before evidence has advantages coz he is looking loopholed so he can dispute Mngomezulu 😳😳😳 from KZN she was bought Time up please chair fair enough last bite Fuzile is frustrated by lies

KGB pomp,what noise is that it is irritating.
Felix Ezangu,"plse the rules must apply accordingly
Kundan Verma,hi bho hip
Monde Mnguni,I agree that these may be delaying tactics but the commission is clumsy and opens itself up to credibility issues. The DCJ needs to answer the question of precedence as raised...he should be thinking about his report being challenged later on and therefore must ensure as best as he can that he adheres to them. @Cain very true - he's giving credence to some like me who are suspicious of his inclinations. But the commission communicated a process...it must explain the deviation. The commissions legal team is an embarrassment beyond imagination. Zondo has been badly found wanting. The evidence leader is bumbling along and the chair is not interjecting... This evidence leader is incoherent...at one stage the rules are important and a breath later not so much but the most disappointment is from the DCJ himself. @Melvict you would think they will make sure of such.
Zakhele Tshabalala,HMMMMM HMMMMMMM HMMMMMM HMMMMMM HMMMMMMMM HMMMMMMMM HMMMMMMM THATS ALL HE KNOWS LOOPHOLES THIS GUY KNOWS HIS STORY HE HAS DONE HIS STORY THAT LADY JUDGE OPEN A CAN OF WORMS NOW ZONDO IS A CLOWN THIS COMMISSION IS THE PITS BRING BACK APARTHEID THIS IS A JOKE ANOTHER PROSPONEMENT THIS MASUKU IS DROPPING BOMBS MASUKU TRASSHED ZONDO MASUKU TRASHED ZONDO ZONDO IS ACLOWN UYINDODa masuku masuku is the man masuku thank u zondo loopholes kube niyabona ukuthi imali idliwa kanjani everyone in sa is an embarrasment for letting this slide SA is a joke now keep looting guys lol fuze lamafuze fuze lamafuze mudle give them a room please lol wasting time i c fuzile is also on the comments bobatr fuzile

Queen K,morning all we are back here again. hahaha Fuzile amandla Fuzile.
Dominic Przybylski,Who is evidence leader? It takes time to fabricate evidence... Van Rooyen's evidence is important because his evidence could directly implicate Zuma and Guptas. Zondo is allowing himself to be manipulated. Surely before any questioning begins Van Rooyen should introduce himself and give some background to who he is and what his qualifications are? Weird that his testimony begins with a cross-examination of somebody else. Wow! Only 3 minutes late! """...before you proceed...""? It is council's role to proceed Shows that a degree is no protection against corruption or a lack of ethics. Highly educated person cannot claim ignorance when he becomes part of a corrupt situation. advisor = handler Success is the ultimate qualification. Seems this lawyer is trying to twist interpretation of witness statements. "Interesting to know who Gigaba's ""advisers"" were." """comrade"" is another word for ""capturer""" "Some cannot distinguish ""annoyance"" from ""arrogance""." """injury time"" lol." Who was injured? Lunch time has highest priority in this commission.
Cain Chunda,u people and your biasis u end up sounding dumb. why is the chairperson refusing to do the basics of conducting the process? the chairperson must play by the rules. why is he changing the rules when Fuzile must be exposed of his lies 🤥 lamola there are rules of the commission and we must play by the rules correct Mnguni the DCJ is losing his impartiality Dave notes he should also have recommended for de klerk and your land thieves ancestors to be jailed too Indeed now he's shuffling correct the DCJ is losing the plot Tebogo u r the embarrassment Makhosi be quiet 🤫 u embarrassing yourself correctly so Masuku is excellent. he's won the day indeed yes Monde the DCJ is really embarrassing and I don't know what happened to him masango u an embarrassment I'm sure u wouldn't even know what the Socalled stalingrad is Indeed Monde u correct Mnguni where r the con artists that were attacking n insulting Masuku here? @funiciaz the DCJ was asked to implement the rules wr call it cross examination Fuzile is all over the show Fuzile is lying Fuzile exposed. he's emotional and his dumb fan club can't see Fuzile is a clown those that understand law and cross examination knows Fuzile is a clown being exposed @cezula register law 101 & talk to me "Phakamile I am Cezula and am listening not as a fanatic but objective legal mind Fuzile is a disgrace Cezula don't expose your foolishness. Barron don't b dumb. Fuzile is not answering the questions but arrogantly making statements Fuzile 🤣🤣🤣 no u just attacked me from nowhere no problem naledi Respect to you too. am sure Cezula is learning civility here
Owen Nyilika,Mr Roy Van Rooyen This Evindence of Fuzile Is very Important To Zondo What Is The name of this adv This Adv is out of other guys This Adv is out of order guys
Susan Williams,Let's apply a rule from a childhood game called Monopoly. Go directly to jail. Do not pass begin. Do not collect R200. Tear up the get out of jail free card.
Wallace Oliver,what is this @Nyameko Gqadu also want to know
Pheladi Lamola,I thought those who want to cross-examine have to give their own version first. Or did I get that wrong?
Nyameko Gqadu,what is happening here
Boyza Mofokeng,hmmmmmmmm....mmmmm
funicanz,"@Nyameko Gqadu  Des van Rooyen Mr Masuku's tactics of delaying at its' best. "@Zamile Hina  "Thanks "@Cain Chunda  This guy must calm down. "Does he know what a ""spine"" is?" These people are making noise. This advocate is not prepared. They assumed Chair was going to postpone. "Mthathe "@Esme Van Heerden  "@Sthakathi Khumalo 
Jan Mfati,so e want to cross examine before we give evidence? Nah Breathe u are about to have a heart attck and rude too u now want to fetter the discretion of the DCJ so u came here with a clear intention
Moonchild,"Hi @all - just cam in
Ashley Mendelowitz,Unfortunately there is a pattern of disrespecting the DCJ developing here... Masuku has got this wrong. 8.1 and 8.2 are clear. It’s not about normal court processes. This is a commission of inquiry.
annalie potgieter,Ashley he brought that onto himself after the ridiculous situation with Makhubele What he allowed there was unavceptable No deviatiin Zondo can do what he thinks suit the situation Exactly MGati F Ag Zulu get a life. You do not even knpw what it means If the commisiion does not do their work They open themselves to thos Kind of crap
Barry & Ria van Niekerk,v o2xp
Moditi Ledwaba,"hau Masuku
Luthando Xhamlayo,I am no fan of the Guptaz and their friends but I think Advocate Masuku has a point. I don't understand why Justice Zondo has a problem with Van Rooyen Cross-examining Fuzile first. This guys is disorganized. Was it not possible for Masuku to do the cross-examination? This lawyer though.....the the the the.....can't he read properly? Fuzile needs to calm down. I know it can be very annoying when you are being questioned by someone whose IQ is lower than yours. I sense that Fuzile is becoming a bit arrogant.
Wildthing,waste of time. time is money
Grant Pannewitz,"This is not a trial "He a had a copy of the documents last year already
tebogo tsheole,masuku is an embarrassment to black excellence someone must report masuku to the bar.
Zamile Hina,van rooyen must give his side of the story first if i may ask; did Mr van rooyen testify before? but why he can be allowed to question MR Vuzile first en testify later? fuzile is hot fuzile won the game fuzile won the game
DUMI ZuLU,Zondo Commission is nothing else but an institute design to targert those who have been identified as the enemies of Neo-Colonialism and their white associates.
mandisi ntauzana,A black SC is called an embarrassment...... Adv Masuku one of the best SC in the country is making solid legal points
Polite Shingange,this whole state capture is just a set up
kevindbn007,Another delay amazing how the law helps criminals problem is they are not through! too much heresay wats the cost of this commission so far?
dennis oldude,if he will tell the truth what difference does it make - do they want to coax him with answers so tyhat he can lie more convuiincingly No postponement at all Dominic Przybylski I agree - anything to get more rtime to Who is dumber here the attorney or Fuzile? brown nosing? What has this got to do with anything? uh ehh uh eh eh uhh Quaklification and common sense don't necessarily live in the same body If he wasn't forced to follow the script of the Guptas it may have worked/ mind you his other advisor/handler was JZ? The hour is gong to expire without anything happening ? Lets hope that Des doesn't waste as much time as his attorney does time is over!!!!!! does nobody have a watch? + and 5 minutes is how long?
Mr Green,What's happening here? lol
sabelo dladla,1.9k 💃 2k💃 procedural fairness is very important
vincent kolobe,The RET brigade is on fire here. This lawyer is being undressed by fuzile 😂😂😂😂
Dingaan Masango,Stalingrad tactics becomes a norm by SC representing Gupta stooges i.e. Adv Maluleka last week Cain hope you are an example of excellence
Donovan Landsberg,DCJ most probably will use his discretion and reject Masuku' application. @Zamile Hina not according to my knowledge
NICO LEBONA,the report will be released on 2024 making money
Melvict Melbourne,Why can't these people get their act together and get basic things like documents sorted out. Surely he had a copy of that document.... can they adjust the focus No wonder the courts never get their job done. what s this guy trying to do? having a masters degree from a south african uni does not mean anything "it is not a wish Try and migrate then you'll see UCT is top in top 40. this is painful to watch Can't these guys get something as basic as numbering files properly "I don't need to undermine it I know UCT is in SA. It is also no 39 in the world QS world wid eputbit at 220 QS Global World Ranking ranked UCT at 220 in the world Try and get a skills assessment for a visa application then you will see what I mean what was the question...hehehe Fuzile is a step be step person @Keith Odwa are you a gupta stooge
Sydney Thobejane,"the legal team is making the work of zondo difficult "Manuka is right
Esme Van Heerden,time wasting Mr Fuzile was an excellent witness last year "Mr Fuzile is credible and articulate
Jacqueline Jayamaha,"to me Zondo had dropped the ball. I know he's trying to be fair but honestly he seems to have very little control and soon it will be lunch time and NOTHING will have happened.

Fuzile is asking a rhetorical question Fuzile knows his stuff nd processes Gupta fans please dont run Fuzile down. He's protecting our country Stop wasting taxpayers money DCJ Fergie time guy! Oh no public give inputs on documents This attorney is throwing Weekend Special under the bus. @Itumeleng inputs by whom Weekend Special should have testified before this cross examination
MX. MDLALANA,The attorney is unclear of cross examination The attorney is all over... I'm unable to follow his main objective in questioning. Can't even put a question into the witness @Peter... I agree you do much better "@Estelle it is untrue... he is being cross examined. So Lol kwaaaa kwakwaaa!!!! the DCJ is assisting the poor attorney Hey this attorney... is damaging his client's case LET'S ALL WAIT FOR THE RE-EXAM. THE GUY HAS FAILED TO POKE HOLES 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Lost angel of the law 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 You say that is not advice... 😂😂😂 Wow!!! the erstwhile DCJ Moseneke is surely frowning from the attorney 🤔. Ambiguous questions invites ambiguous answers. 😂😂😂😂 show me. OK let's leave that??? Geez!!! the DCJ is teaching the advocate who is not laying base.
Samuel Skosana,Mr Fuzile is far tooo sharp for this attorney. He is waffling now Is this what his senior council fought for??? What a waste of time Only has 3 minutes left now "Agreed "Chair Fuzile is far too brilliant for these lawyers. "Chair No more time after extra time Mr Zondo This fiasco is a disgrace to the Commission 5 Minutes up Chair!!! no more grace Like me Mr Fuzile doe'nt suffer fools gracefully Time up Chair Fuzile for President
ANDILE DYONASI,"Fuzile has lost his cool the Chair may might as well do the cross examination as this Advocate is clearly useless
Maryann Diamond,they All meant hey all what's been happening? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣yoooooooh "🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"" injury time """ lm . listening and he is dodging 🤣
Sekgololo Johannes,This one is straight out a Gupta Advovo This Advocate is not seeking the truth but wants only entrapment. "This Advocate is struggling THAT IS A LIE UNTRUE HE was/is a captured minister Advocate. Mathipe is a mockery "A lawyer must be sharp @sipho percival that is the sore fact @Lwazi Mxenge i hear u Adv. Mathipe is desperate
Margareth Waterboer,"@Daysman
Batandwa Yawa,When would this commission end?
sekgome khame,Some of these lawyers are a joke stru...
Bizana Ngesi,The Advocate is an example of 'Black excellence' or Radical Economic Transformation Why engage a lucky packet Advocate?
Mr A,The purpose of Cross Examination is to create doubt. Van Rooyen's lawyer is failing to punch holes in Lungisa's testimony. Van Rooyen's Digging himself deeper in a hole.
CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE,"Keith listens selectively This cross examination is a waste of time.....nd Des' money....if he is paying Keith you seem to be listening to something else I doubt you are. But Fuzile appears to be very arrogant We adjourn for lunch....... But this lawyer confirms that Van Rooyen shared info with selected people whom we now know they were Gupta deployees
Isaac Maluleka,come on guys please
Estelle Kruger,"This witness is very aggressive? In a real court "Hi valencia Mr Fuzile must just calm down and focus. They are trying to derail his evidence. Mathipe is trying to knife Fuzile....lol
Luna Moose,This guy.. This guy!!
Bhekani Nene,Des Van Rooyen’s legal team spent so much time arguing for the cross examination of Fuzile prior to Van Rooyen’s testimony and this is what they come with Fuzile during the last shot 💥
Teunis van Ree,hostile witness only if he is your own witness @Wesley he is van Rooyen's counsel
Tsepang R,Keith is just one of many south africans who choose to live in obscurity Keith has Mr Fuzile fired you before? It seems personal Keith is probably just part of the anc's patronage network Cain and Keith both clowns in the same circus the biggest clown here is this lawyer
mandla tshabalala,Fuzile💪💪💪💪💪
Donavan Arthur,This lawyer is confused😂😂😂😂😂take him Fuzile
thabiso mngadi,fuzile is a genius i can b a better lawyer than this clown hour gone and still we dnt know what this lawyer is saying :elbowcough::elbowcough:
Sammy Mashamba,Representing the #RETForcegang is painful. The Special Weekend's SC is trying by all means to pin Mr Fuzile but he's failing dismally. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kagiso Kwelagobe,Fuzile take your things👊🏾👊🏾👊🏾
Makhosi Ngobe,""" Version b4 my input "" and "" the version after my input "". Its a great answer" "Hahahahah """ The point being . . ."" Hahahaha """. . . hahahah "Hahahaha "Hahahahah hahahahah
Thato Aubrey Maphanga,fuzile is a liar. he only has a big mouth to cover his lies Fezile a big lair. Failing to answer questions. Just talking too much a throwing hands all over "Fuzile is just talking too much Guys dont let Fuzile's big mouth confuse you. The guys is just running away from the questions Fuzile is using his BIG MOUTH to run away from the questiona "Fuzile is waiting time with his big Mouth Zondo e chaile baba FUZILE is being exposed. He cant even answer questions. He is only wasting time making noise and throwing hands

Harvey Fuqua,Fuzile is fuming. They won't get anything from him they want. Mathipa is coming across as desperate Fuzile is fuming.
Mduduzi Seakamela,Pomposity at play...Treasury people So an advisor failed to advise
Wesley M,who is this lawyer??? where did they get mr Mathipe??? where is Mr Zondos female lawyers??? this guy mr mathipe who does mathepe represent??? who does maphite represent???? van Rooyens counsel that makes sense
Siyanda Sithole,That is a lie
xolani mzolo,Fire Fuzile
Gcinumzi ka Saki Kakaza,I am struggling to understand what the Advocate is trying to achieve. Advocate has not started to poke holes the evidence of Lungisa. The time is running out. Some of the questions by Advocate are laughable. The Advocate is not doing justice to Mr Avn Rooyen """Lest you confuse me if you are confused"". Lungile is entertaining me" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bianca A,Listen to the chair sir.
Makabongwe Mgubela,How I wish Mr Fuzile can cool down a bit so that he can focus on dismantling their cross examination. We have seen these things where they call people in departments without clear...You can't argue with your boss you will see the door wide open

Abe M Mosiuoa,Even if you're losing the argument and you know you're losing and you're going to lose... as a lawyer... right? You must convince your client to have represented him/her to your best of your ability. They trespassed and that Mr. Fuzile... you're on point is treason.
Phakamile Khuzwayo,Cain in other ways do you think van Rooyen was a right man to take over Nene that time or defending the Guptas? Cain the problem u can have Masters but u must also have to apply ur master mind when you get to the position to lead Fuzile is also street wise
Thulane Bongane,this thing takes us nor where injury time mara zondo mr fuzile wat a man mr fuzile u re a star
George Lwanda,This attorney thinks this is Generations... mxm...

Sibusiso Nkosi,Problem with people who are laymen in law tend not to answer what they are being asked. Fuzile is dealing with the lawyer and his arrogance won't assist him Referring my foot as the advisory you should have say NO If this was a court of law Fuzile would be a dead fish 😂😂😂 Fuzile has waisted time with his arrogance The lawyer is exposing loopholes from Fuzile's statements The lawyer is so calm and this Fuzile guy is so emotional and is killing his evidence
