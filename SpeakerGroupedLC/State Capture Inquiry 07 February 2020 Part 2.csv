Kung Fu Kenny,"I don't think anything will happen to the most corrupt criminals of South Africa. Look at Ramaphosa and Zuma That Passion Gap can hold my R2 for parking Maybe even a R5 They are laughing with arrogance. Nothing will happen. Section 25 law change will not stop at property. It includes all assets of all people and even your bank account. Her hands together signals Guilt. That's self comfort. A typical alert of body language combined with her Mime hand. her body language alone shows she is lying. Nervous laughter. I can tell this woman had her education first while studying. She is clamping down. @Felix Muyoba Look at her touching her arms and hands together. Trying to self comfort won't help now lol. If only all South Africans had the same mindset to eliminate this corruption that runs South Africa. 2.5-2.8 Million NOT TAXED "Nothing was taxed Trying to back peddle won't work! Double Mime hands. Ayooooooo @Jacob Zuma I know how to say it but not how to spell it. I would butcher that name lol @Roza essack The property was paid for Does she realize she is part of the crime investigation? Being involved in crime will get you arrested. Whether you pretend to know or not. Everytime when she is lying she starts smiling lol. @Scorpion Sting One of the best spots to build a home in South africa "@Mtokozisi Baleni Lol indeed ... Soon she will start to stutter @Nikaila Naidu Getting cornered by intelligence.

Francoise Phillips,Did she declare that 'donation' and pay tax on it? "She is trying to pretend that SAAT did not tell her that she cannot take bribes SAA is dying a slow and painful death thanks to incompetent crooks and thieves like this woman. Yup and rather fast. All these board members at all these SOE's need to be declared delinquent directors. Time for criminal accountability. This will be the last we see of this smily thief. Yup seems like this woman will be at Military hospital getting a vague sick note from Zuma's flexible and dishonest Dr Muteme. Off to the Eastern Cape to get her mother's story to match her lie.
