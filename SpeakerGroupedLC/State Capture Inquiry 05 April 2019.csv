Ricus Ellis,"Corruption is the most heinous and spineless crime imaginable. Only the weak of mind participates in it. Greed "Isn't it time to brand Because they steal money from institutions that is meant to curb these crimes.
Magda Seguin,The ANC is self destructing yet the brainwashed will still vote for them. @goolamv I think his hair is grey..the lighting is bad EFF caused violent havoc in Houtbay that this morning at an SABC debate for small political parties @Peter pott..the ANC lost their moral compass...we are witnessing history of the implosion of the ANC @peter pott the ANC is entrenched in 'the collective'..they perfected groupthink and closing ranks...their skeletons are only being revealed now due to whistleblowers and investigative journalists @Peter pott economic development That is what the ANC does...use people...remember the eighties how highschool learners was used...there is credible research how those kids were left to their own devices after losing their education "The slogan was 'liberation before education' @makhosi there are a few videos of Jesse verbally abusing journalists @Dumile Mateza the ANC uses the party resolutions as a benchmark...not the Constitution "The AU is a talk shop I agree @Dumile Mateza...SA pays a huge member fee and nothing gets done.China and Russia are communist dictatorships and Brazil hard a far right wing President...it's a recipe for disaster. "Name one thing that SA has benefited from SADC The AU kept Mugabe in power...their so called peer mechanism was a joke "I am just mentioning the facts @welton paulse...I watched his body language in the interview last night at Luthuli house with the enca journalist..he was very dodgy Apparently Ace only worked with cash...same tactic as Watson Ace has a R10m house in a gated community in Bloemfontein Can't remember....read the book extract..I am trying to buy it online as I'm not in SA at the moment @Tshepo Mokoena it is apparently where the very rich live "Eskom spokesperson resigned I will look it up and let you know This morning there was an article on a school in the EC that has no toilets..only pit toilets... or classrooms.The school was eventually built by the community with their own money. The Eskom spokesperson who resigned is Khulu Pasiwe This is the umpteenth time someone witnessing says that they were dismissed immediately Is this man not maybe fearful? @Neo Mongale the ANC had more than 24 years...so your excuse is apartheid for state capture? So you are ok with the ANC theft of taxpayers money? I reported you for harassment hate speech @Neo Mogale...YT has community rules @Neo Locale where were you when I suffered under apartheid...go away and play somewhere else Blocked Neo Mogale The ANC stole the R1.7 billion Mbeki gave for the employment of Alexandra The ANC neglected Alex for more than 25 years now they instigate this blaming Mashaba who is only yhere for 2 years...people dont realise tvey are being used then read credible information provided by brilliant investigative journalists or do you also say they are stratcom So many paid trolls and botshere today Not just white people @Jean-Pierre Me Roux...Indians and Coloureds too. O reported and blocked Neo Mogale...he called me a racist They have the BLF and EFF The two most racist political parties in SA Racists have self hate...they project it on others Why was this guy allowed to budge in? This is unprecedented...never happened before...it's not a court of law that entertains rebuttals @Jean-Pierre Me Roux...the economy is only holding on with loans from China and elsewhere...the national debt runs into trillions I saw that this morning...maybe he will quote from it "ANC politicians involved their kids in state capture...Zuma CR is making excuses...why do he allow implicated state capture cadres on the list...he should have fired them already..or at least suspended them The EFF also claims that they introduced the commision...lol Floyd Shivambu owns the resruarant/bar in Vilikazi street allegedly using VBS funds...the EFF is quiet since the news came out @Peter pott...he could have done it long before the list was released The government should have fallen already ...it happens in other democracies but SA is too divided...political parties thrive of diving people just like on this thread *dividing "The Gumedes @Peter Sant I am talking about the population holding their office bearers accountable...they are succeeding in making SA a failed state Anyone voting ANC is happy with the status quo which is wholesale theft of state resources Another chance to steal? "People have short memories...Marikana happened not so long ago Yes @Peter Sant...the ANC stuck with Zuma in nine no confidence votes...I do t trust the ANC to repent or mend their ways...they take South Africans for idiots Cyril is just ONE man against a criminal faction in the NEC Maybe Cyril will be gone after the elections if the implicated state captured has their way @Luvuyo Zantsi you obviously know nothing about ANC history @Ty Bosch the ANC 'integrity committee is an oxymoron @Thulani Bukani 😄 @Peter Sant right now I don't see only a handful of honest one's against a mass of thieves @Robert Russell 🤣 YouTube Channel we are not hating just extremely traumatised and angry that the soul of our country was sold to the highest bidder...our tax money blood and sweat was looted in front of our very eyes @Afrika Centane I was already disgusted with the ANC since what happened before and after Polokwane Alex is in trouble due to ANC neglect now they are using people in a political ploy...the ANC stooped so low it is pathetic Why don't CR go to Alex and explain what the ANC did with the R1.7billion? Mashaba has only been there for 2 years...you are really brainwashed I often rode through Alex...have you been there yet? @Robert Russell hence the putrid state of our roads with potholes the size of a bath Mashaba invited CR to go with him to go to Alex...I saw it on Twitter but dololo from CR I would like to know why Mr Dukwana was summarily fired Mafia talk...spreading the millions of our money The ANC was leading the Gauteng government for 23 years and did nothing to uplifymt Alex...Mashaba wanted CR to account to the people
Dams daily motivations Madamalala,vote ANC COMES may 8 People who do not have plan for themselves have the guts to blame other State capture was introduced to help blacks to To Run the Country now we have a Donald J Trump as A Real estate guy running the state & SA Cyril Remember politians are Greedy Not Trump & Cyril if You do not have Rich dad mindset you'll steal

Derek Main,@psyfrequency Techno The ANC politicians are too busy filling their own pockets to care about anyone else. Only the fool ANC voters can't see this. @Lucky123 Thwala As if we believe a word that Ace says. He's a well practised liar. @Vusumzi Ngcoza Hearing about all this corruption and still voting for the corrupt party even though they serve only their own interests. How is that not dumb? @Vusumzi Ngcoza Yes - no-one has been proven guilty yet but we have known about this corruption for years and years through the media. Many warned that Zuma would ruin SA if he became president. @Vusumzi Ngcoza The only ones who couldn't see it were the fool ANC supporters. Magashule has done to the Free State what Zuma did to SA. @Sanele Mabaso What do you call the demise of SA under ANC rule? I'd say it's a huge fall. @Sanele Mabaso Who said anything at all about the DA? You are making assumptions. Didn't the National Party merge with the ANC? @Sanele Mabaso Read your history books - the National Party merged with the ANC. That's why van Schalkwyk became a cabinet minister in the ANC government. @Sanele Mabaso Huh?! You are getting incoherent. Calm down.
Lucky123 Thwala,Ace Magashule told news24 that there is nothing explosive that Dukwana will testify today. Dukwana's attorney has copy of @PLMyburgh's Gangster State on the table in front of him.
Vusumzi Ngcoza,"we also note that every developing country have pity toilets @Derek Main honestly this commission has not proven anyone guilty for any wrong doings so people are still going to answer on their evidence

Dumile Mateza,There is notion that when a resolution is taken by the ANC that it is law.They would say 'we adopted a resolution it must happen' Our government seemsbent on addressing the wrong thing regarding xenphobia outbreaks in KZN. They should instead address the impugnity with which their friends rule their countries "If i ever were to become the president of the country i would pull this country out of the AU @magdaSeguin the former progressive President of Brazil who was feted by Cosatu and talked about the Lula moment is in jail @ElliotSaasa I am not too sure looking at what come out of VBS Mutual Bank and going to the Limpopo debacle with Gwangwas company and Malema Wecannot be bogged down with a diary. The Chair should order those who either burnt the dairy or are refusing to release it. They should be arrested for obstruction of justice I am afraid that Ace and Duarte will be recalled at the NGC of the ANC. Ukufa kusembizeni H emight also be locked up in the same facility. Remember the Watson accommodation inPE @Pheladi Lamola it is some woman appointed by Magashula she laso serves on the Womens League executive I does the Chairman not issue a subpoena to arrest the Premier? Did Ace capture the judiciary in the Free State I am about to start my own You Tube the biggest You Tube channel inthe world. What was the ANC through Magashula in Venezuela to learn about a desytroyed economy "@AfikaCentane wathi uSoga Bona izwe laowethu uxolel'izono zalo ungayithob'ingqumbo yakho @MagdaSeguin it is not negligence. There was a fund by National Governemnt for the renewal of Alex.

Moketa Morapela,this teacher should have stayed at that primary school Cameron Kim this guy is saying nothing to us where is EFF that gave Mashaba power? we still waiting to hear how Ace is implicated?
Louie,"Jngle Pssy  they won't learn from the west. The west don't include theft and corruption of this magnitude. It's all about self enrichment in the shortest period. there was no state to capture. The whites created the state. 200 years of developing a country. Neo Mongale is just plain ignorant.

Born free,Correct @cameron Kim I am a self confessed REALIST Realism not racism I have title Deeds for you? well said@0Cameron Kim. Well the primitive had not built anything except mud huts I gave senna Black racism it is called Xenophobia "Frankly The Malawian's In America a coloured is considered a Black person It has already reached the Junk Status SA is doomed They don't know how to trade fairly let alone trade It is trade for self gain and not for the benefit of South Africans The Arabs were the first in the slave trade that's a fact. Wait till China or Russia takes over you will wish this country was colonised. China will get rid of the unions The ANC was created by The communist Russians and Cubans Not the westerners but your favorite party and politicians are stealing. They cannot read the constitution they would not understand a word of it 🤣🤣 Why would South Africa be different to any other failed state in Africa... unfortunately it will become a failed state it is predictable. yes Zuma was the dumbest President ever oh but clever enough to enrich himself and his closest comrades with Gavin Thompson as his chief whip. "Why do you spell Africa with a""K"" just curious!?" Where does AKKRA originate from? The Chinese were instrumental in removing Mugabe from power So please explain where you Where does AKKRA originate from and what language? AKKRA means Ants and it is a region in Ghana. I have just researched it. Searched or Researched it makes sense Is a Spatula something you use to turn a fried egg with?
Ty Ritch,how can land be stolen if you buy it "Stealing from SA tax payers has nothing to do with race "Why would the FS government not hand over evidence It would of been great if the ICT Hub and City of tomorrow where built. So many jobs would of been created SAY YES to Corruption HAHAHA The sad thing is Free State residence suffer and paid the price ANC integrity committee cant even stop their members from looting. Everyone that has been to the GUPTA compound should be Jailed for Treason "@Quintin Jacobs yes sure. If you steal and make SA pay for more FUEL @ Wallace Mandimutsira I think they forged his signature
Anne M.,I hope someone on the legal team is going to report that judge to the JSC "@Khaya Nomoyi Also my question @Khaya Nomoyi Agree @Quintin Jacobs This commission was set up specifically to look into state capture - as per the previous Public Protector (Thuli Madonsela) "@Quintin Jacobs Look into or root out
Quintin Jacobs,did this bloke also suffering from Errrr Errr Errrr can the StateCaptureCom also bring in ALL the politician MEC's and Premiers that had tours in factories of WMC seems this StateCaptureCom should be renamed as StateWasCapturedByTheGuptasOnly the focus is just the Guptas and JZ where is the corruption of WMC or the BBEEE fronting by white companies fact is come 9th May 2019 Ramaphosa faction will be weak Anne M. incorrect it was set up to root our State Capture. We all know now Thuli's report was based on Faketjies & JonAss lies *out @Callaway Van Zeeberg then its best if you in SA you need to get your visas ready to leave for Australia or Canada @Anne M. who?? she based the whole report on those 2 lairs @Moshoeu Mabusela CORRECT ie Steinhoff gov workers pension but NO NO they untouchable cause the captured the Ramaphosa faction askaris want to change the ANC electoral list because the realise the BRANCHES picked pro JZ cadres and not picked by Bidvest @Afika Centane the ANC is using Mr Buffalo just to gain votes. Once election is finish and euphoria settles Mr Buffalo must fall on his sword for crimes at Marikana and Bosassa (Nasrec) "In military science so white media coined the Guptas house as a compound so we all have compounds not houses its known GodZille was frequenting with the Guptas at Sahara Oval but WHY is the premier called to the StateCaptureCom?? Can someone help me where is the letter why didnt make a copy @Ty Bosch i WOULD say yes if you say YES to anyone visits Ruperts / Oppenheimers etc as well
Khaya Nomoyi,How could a judge dismiss this application and make an order to costs against the applicants when there was no opposition to the application They must name the judge.This is not acceptable. What is happening in the Free state government needs serious attention.The Chief Justice will have to take note of this information.
