adrian albertyn,crazy numbering system
watson mutanga,The Commission hasn‚Äôt yet devised a format for labelling it‚Äôs own folders! It‚Äôs ironic that they are unveiling incompetence in parastatals when they themselves look like they‚Äôre struggling. I hope they won‚Äôt adjourn for the purpose of sorting out the filing.
Alvino Theunissen,Filing is really confused! Why don't they sit with the chair in his office agree prior start of commission to get the filing correct! Agree Vurivi the chair creating confusion Subpoena everyone then so that everyone to appear before commission otherwise their will be more delays! everyone = all involved in state capture How many houses could not have been build with all the ANC corruption money not a single person should be without a roof over their heads! People only want Employment and Housing and the employement make respos "to buy food! Job Creation should have Invention Hub like a Silicon Valley Well educated but will act dump! Deep rooted ANC member. He is arrogant and confident not recall timelines of receiving report! Agree@MIKE DURBAN Its well rehearsed his replies to commission. He plays he don't know or can't recall but all a plot from his lawyers and him but taking the Judge and commission for a ride prove their points
Lynett Makatini,it always starts as a commission of filing and bundling just to involve us ayii maybe its another tender
Barbara Sattler,because it has to be on record it has to be on record mr. zondo pressing his lips very tightly together. maybe for the future always a directiv or supheno for all . mr. Ramaphosa wants to impress the IMF. start packing a box with emergency water and food. because the sound is not on this is complicated has the witness been sworn in? reload the page still no excuse I have helped many bantus and others. I have given up now as my house was burgled during #5 lockdown a person who lives legally in Europe did they mention S you can say that again
vurivi sydwell,The commission should develop and promoligate Directives on paginating and bundling files and exhibitsü§ûü§î
skeetpetegibbs,AFRICAN TIME AS USUAL
dennis oldude,Stop rather why is clown so far off the system that the whole team should be using and why can he fix it during lunch or tea time? does it need to take 30 minutes to gethere? Another bunch of excuses for not appearing. These people who should appear must be prepared to pay the costs of the wasted time? Agree wholeheartedly that all the involved parties must be issued with directives to appear so that excuses are no longer accepted. Now subpoena everyone and stop wasting time Who is going to pay the legal fees that are being wasted - If he has nothing to hide - he doesn't need lawyers Can't they sort out the housekeeping issues before the whole country needs to watch these shenanigans cathey514 ‚Äã It is difficult to explain that what happens here is the international performance of the ANC 3 ring circus its is easier to be a minister of police than it is to explain what I did - with the support of the then president who need protection from prosecution for the crimes that the collective committed So with the background of being responsible - are you now going to take responsibility for your actions? do we need the history lesson/ and at this pace we will get to 2010 next week some time Anything but get to the point? and all this has got what to do with the commission of inquiry and you forgot the role of fire pool salesman - expressly appointed bu J'Kop You see we can find excuses for all our criminal buddies to whitewash their malfeasance. What has this got to do with state capture? her ye hear ye so sayeth the keeper of the moral high ground. Foreigners are people born in other countries bi\ut we will use any platform to make political speeches And this R Sole was the minister responsible for enforcing the law and the next issue will be xenophobia instead of state capture. If he was wrong in the first place - its OK for me to support him- Via the SAP intelligence State capture please - not immigration? can we can this argument - it really has nothing to do with state capture? This has got nothing to do with the commission. Who cares with what you understand This man said that he has a problem with his lower back = w2j\ha he should have said is he is a pain in the @@@@ They are exhibiting is an a disgraceful lack of planning and a total waste of taxpayers money while they decide what a document should be called. They did undertake to sort this out at lunch time? He is the one confused with the numbers - and for allowing this to take so much of the commission time He has now respect for the money that is being wasted fnb invest

"@Pap Kola ""a person born in or coming from a country other than one's own"" - Google" Anybody know of a politician who isn't a parasite? President Mujica of Uruguay is only exception I can think of. Mujica donated 90% of his salary to charity so that he earned average salary of his country. The only thing he owned was a 1987 VW beetle. @Kevin She's cool but still coins it. "@Kevin Fair enough This is such a waste of time. Surely this advocate should have had his ducks in a row. "Zondo should have had guts to issue interim reports like Nugent did in the SARS commission of inquiry. People are losing confidence in Zondo Almost time for tea adjournment. Zondo will be exhausted soon. @Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi It took Zondo 30 minutes longer than us to realise that this is not a productive use of the commission's time. Why appoint somebody as minister of police when he knows nothing about policing. Guaranteed to fail. @Cerebis Nhleko - ex minister of police of fire pool fame. "@Melusi Sikakane ""fire pool"" was excuse for building a fancy swimming pool at Zuma's private home with excuse that it was provided for security in case of a fire." "@Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi We had a president in charge of the whole of government with virtually no formal education PW Botha was a disaster too. PW Botha and Ramaphosa seem to be very similar. Botha didn't have the courage to cross the Rubicon and Ramaphosa doesn't have the courage to make a similar break with the past. @Melusi Sikakane If my assertion is empty then it means that state capture was not due to JZ's ignorance but was premeditated. I imagine this commission will answer that at the very least. I need to start smoking again. I've gained nearly 10kgs since I stopped. @makhosi nobhatyi Sell a bottle of wine today and you'll be in jail tomorrow. Steal all a pensioners money from VBS + a few million Rands more nothing happens to you... Why? @Melusi Sikakane Nothing to do with too much reading. Either JZ allowed state capture through ignorance and incompetence or he planned and executed it. What other alternative is there? @Melusi Sikakane Most of the money paid by taxpayers which was meant to help and uplift the people who were previously disadvantaged was captured. What planet do you live on? @Singi Mathebula The ANC is the university which specialises in corruption. You can join by making a small donation. @Singi Mathebula It may help if you open a bank account in Dubai then offer it as a place for others to hide their money... Best of luck. @Singi Mathebula If you are corrupt you don't use your own money. Find somebody else who has money and use theirs. @Danie Nilsen There has always been corruption but BEE is corruption on steroids. Corruption in government is more serious than in private sector because government forces people to pay tax while private sector needs to convince people to pay voluntarily. In private sector we have a choice whether we accept dealing with a company. In public sector we don't have a choice. That's why corruption in public sector is so serious. If government is corrupt and tries to play a dominant role in the economy then corruption will dominate. The economy will become rotten. Oh it already has! Will be interesting to see how many companies are prepared to deal with a government/SOEs which cannot pay their suppliers. We will end up with two separate economies. "@Hubert Maphumulo The danger of identifying yourself as a member of a particular social group [race/religion/ etc] and thereby claiming to be a victim or An individual is more likely to be a victor than a victim. "@Hubert Maphumulo I don't understand what 'ilets' are but though I do understand that the more power a person gets them more he wants please excuse the typos Democracy is a facade. Is boring without Katie. "This man has had months to prepare/remember "It seems to me that he didn't ""exercise his mind"" but just did whatever the Zuptas told him to do." "He was not paid to think. That was the ""reference group's"" job." Was he drunk or what? Why does he have such overwhelming amnesia about something which was extremely significant during his tenure? @Henry Chauke The only way to remove them is via the ballot box. That's highly unlikely so we'll just have to accept that we get the government the majority continues to vote into power. """I employ consultants to apply my minds for me Judge vs Judge may be interesting. @Derek Govender Requirement for minister is that he does not use his own initiative but just does whatever the bribers pay him to do.

Kevin Simon,This lawyer is an ABSOLUTE waste of time. Notice he is AVOIDING eye contact with the DCJ. I'm sure DCJ is an expert at reading body language. Witness is falling into a trap he has set for himself. "Regarding Mbangwa; ""Given his history...."" He either did not know his history or he ignore it. So how can he say 'given his history?:" Wiping your mouth whilst speaking is often a sign of not speaking the truth and subconsciously acknowledging the untruth. Bet he did not read Sabotage

Leon Mbangwa,I was employed because of skills and experience I posses. I was convicted for carrying an Identity Document which was ligitimate and never produced but issued by Home Affairs. No law exist which says a convicted person should never be employed. In fact the only reason to convict me was to stop my endeavor in influencing transformation in the Department of Justice.
Sipho Mnqayi,Capitalism is corruption and corruption is capitalism. How do you justify cooperation running the country? even a school kids can see that our president is dancing to someone else's music.
