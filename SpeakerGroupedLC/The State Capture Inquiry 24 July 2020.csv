khuthadzo moji,who is gonna lead the evidence today?
Barbara Sattler,chaos "@Person I with you @Norma such valuable time
Derrick saperstein,"More stories A female JUDGE> This Senior Council got his training on a puppet show.
Person of interest,Lord help me to be patient in word and deed. Barbara 👍🏾 Musa yes indeed These criminals use the law as a weapon against justice "exactly Judge Makubela Makubela. "Bev They'll be back in a minute Zondo ordered her counsel to contact her. Scroll back in tape later to see how lame it is I wonder if somebody threatened her not to appear? Why wouldn't she contact the commission? Can't understand a judge behaving like this. Supposed to be back at 10.55. Something going on. "Shakoane Ridiculous Is senior counsel a relative of hers? Why is he so tentative? More than 5 months she has known! Why can't McBride have her picked up and taken in for questioning? Is there a legal person here? What a disgraceful act. Now DCJ is mad. "William - me too Outrage would be better ANC sold it to China And this is senior counsel Zondo just making sure this all goes on record. William - ALLEGEDLY weak and lame and feeble we all need to go back to Botes testimony and do our homework for Monday Mr Softvoice is very low energy. I don't think he likes his client. Zondo not accepting this bs "Yay! Action Tomorrow please "xolani This man is very respectful of this disrespectful and lying woman. What sex am I? what prejudices? thanks xolani They all tiptoe round her and she went from reluctant to hostile Wendy that's for sure. Hope Z insists that she appear tomorrow It is like nailing jelly to the wall We are all asking ourselves Four people implicated her "Yes So happy he's getting mad. Bring her in tomorrow. disgraceful. oh for Pete's sake😜 "I am pulling my hair out 👍🏾 Judge Z gonna bring her tomorrow... The behaviour of a judge? Really? Is this man her brother or what? Just dismiss counsel and bring her. Send Uber now! "Hubert "Nkosi @sabc thank you Makhubele is a disgrace. Back! "Nkosi "Four witnesses implicated her As a non-lawyer I am 😳 embarrassed! yay DCJ postponed until tomorrow please I love judge Zondo ✌️ Mlambo must be watching 😔 Another week. "Haibo "riyaad
dennis oldude,is tyi9s another waste of the whole commissions time? Lets hope the Judge says no for once as long as you don't expect anything to be done on time. A calendar or hourglass maybe but not a watch how much has it cost the country so far for this BS? Hiding behind the loopholes in the law shouldn't be allowed - even if she is a judge who has proven to have scant regard for the low how did she get to be a judge in the first place? The same JSC that has been investigating Judge Hlope for the past 10 years and take as long a they do - she will be retired before anything happens Trust me I am a judge? in the footsteps of J'Kop if she is lying in this attempt to delay appearing would that be grounds for impeaching her? Quinton Ndzinisa - can we please start with her arrest? do all the legal eagles need to take forever to say something - Don't worry everyone gets overtime if they sit on Saturday - maybe she should be made to pay for the time wasted and costs incurred as a result Vish Govender - I wholeheartedly agree with you
Thabang Mohale,no they adjourned coz linda mti was not available commision is opposing this application we are taken for fools here she is scared of something summons "some lawyers are useless  incompetent "she never intended to come to the commission  useless unprepared lawyers here DCJ is not playing games the old man is mad summon her for tomorrow which university did this guy study? he bought his degree
Alvino Theunissen,Again Yes grill him Mr Chair They have not acted diligently! Hehehe they taking the Commission for a ride...her car got a tire puncture
Peet Venter,"Chairman her phone is switched off because she's getting a brain scan maybe...
Musa Mabunda,"I want Dudu Myeni and her friend Yakhe Kwinana to the stand "@Wendy Greeff lol Who wants postponement here? That judge Makhubela is playful There might not have been a tyre burst Definitely He is I would have rubbished the excuse and set it down for tomorrow and Sunday
Norma Day,why are these miscreants allowed to play yo-yo and waste time and our money !!!! two weeks and nothing happens rotten from the top
Phakamani Gazu,"Lol they won't bring Dudu Myeni yet @Hubert Maphumulo Exactly.
austin mbuvayesango,"don't trust this Zondo thing
Vuyisani Sikobi,"Fraser is just threatening theres nothing explosive
Njabulo Hlongwane,@Hubert Mr Zondo is very much aware of the ultimate consiquences if he allows Fraser to testify Zondo must precisely deal with this inappropriate conduct and punish them accordingly...amanga wodwa lawa "aybo asinaxesha bakwethu 😂😂😂😂 @Duduzekile please go get her quickly yebo tomorrow😆 @Katlego😂😂😂😂
Malusi Ngwane,They must just stop this thing cos it is going no where and just waisting our money
Wendy Greeff,Wish the Judge will now come down hard on these shenanigans and this rambling on I have now lost all patience with this rambling idiot All these witnesses are either sick or have punctures.....UNBELIEVABLE !!!! Hope she is ready to be grilled without mercy for her failure to be present. Scared to death for sure How dare she disrespect the Commission by being absent with such a lame excuse High Court Judge !!!!! She has a nerve.....!!!!! Clear that she has been giving everybody the run-around all along So she is renowned for her delaying tactics I also agree Really trying everybody's patience - Judge Z especially !!!!! Cant he realize he should step down now Feeble arguments playing for time Realizing they have nothing but time on their side. Even the legal team is now giving everybody the run-around She clearly have no intension of making herself available for tomorrow - hence this lengthy adjournment Summon her for tomorrow .... please Judge He is much to lenient with her And she wins this round
Colleen Arezio,She could've watched the recorded evedience. The postponements are too much and costing South Africans too much. The chair needs to put his foot down. Postponement not medical related then show up. She cant give evidence because she had a wheel puncture and is traumatized?!!!! Please.... these excuses are ridiculous. Is this man really senior council or a flipping law student?!!!🤔
Asif Jamal,Oh really want to do with it
vusumzi mahe,That is that a delaying tactic
Thobani Mnqobi,mmmmmm
William Pieters,the guilty always try run away. we want blood. is it treasonous to say that the ANC is the worst political party that ZA has had in the past 400 years. if not then I say it. why not just say the dog ate her notes. NWO is alive and well. a corrupt Judge. will get interesting. Bev. The Judge is scared of Zondo and does not want to come to the Commision. "The only people that need to be scared of the Inquisition are heretics. You aren't a heretic Judge ​Makubela? Why does she think she is so important that she can show Judge Zondo a middle finger? I hate her and I don't even know her. we still waiting for Zuma's day in court. lol it might still happen Siyanda. the lawyer reminds me of a prophet in some funny church. any of them with Prophits. what? she had an accident yesterday and crashed the car and is stressed today and can't make it. lol Person
Conproc zambia limited,Zondo is upset with the judge. i smell a rat Hello..its not about you answering not excuses after excuses @Level Ground Boerboels ..😀😀😀😀😀

mulugisi lesley,kuyadlalwa
Julio Pfariso,lies of high note zondo take not this lies "she will attend today
vincent kolobe,Lies has become a hobby for thieves nowadays. "Makubela will be summoned to appear monday A so called freedom fighter is soo fragile to appear from a mere tyre bursting. WHAT A LOT OF RUBBISH. I like your tone DCJ "This guy he's just here to waste time This muppet must just take his L and leave.
Phumudzo Ishmael Mamphuri,hahahahahah lies this guys is lying in the eyes of zondo Aah this guy keeps on touching files without anything helpful amateur
Granny Mokwena,wow wow wow "honestly now I'm gatvol with these people! a whole judge!

Hendrick Dube,Who's this person referred as 'she'? Who's that judge?
Eddie Mangwane,"who is ""her"""
Given Mpashi,all lies
Nkosi Da Perf,He’s given her no option but to come. "If she doesn’t 😂 😂 hectic Wasn’t it a 15 minute break kanti ? 😂 @Peet Venter True that @Maphumulo This guy frustrates me remotely getting to his point.. how must Zondo be feeling 😡 I’m very humbled by how poised and stern Zondo has been throughout this engagement. I would’ve summoned her by now @SABC is she even contactable ? Did the phone get abducted to mars I smell a “what’s his name” (Watson) What justice would you get from a court if the judges are corrupt @Derek. "I guess there’s more legitimacy Deceased tyre 😂 @Dominic "All professions guys Waste of time and money 💪🏿 is he gonna use muscle finally ?
Bev Daniels,Is it teatime as only logged on now

Sundie Nells,Just switched on. Are they on break?
Bongukuphiwa Mthethwa,It was....
Rajesh Budooram,waste of tax payers money. This Will go on for ever with no prisoners. like everything else with the looting gangsters
Thabang Letsosa,LIES LIES LIES SHE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND SHE ALSO KNOWS HOW TO ACT. WHAT SHE KNOWS ALSO VERY WELL IS THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO HER.🤷🏾🤷🏾 😂😂😂 Saturday and Sunday she must come.😂😂😂 One can see his anger by the nose rising now and then. What's the excuse gonna be now ? 🤔
Esha J,I didn't ask 🙃
Stephen Monyela,makes sense at all. i didn't expect that from a judge
xolani mzolo,this Shakoane character??? hogwash hogwash hogwash @Siyanda Ntloko it does not make any sense this commission needs to bark and bite let her come tomorrow "tire puncher then 1 can say judge Makhubele is 1 unscrupulous judge I agree dennis can they check the authenticity of the pictures at least a Dr's note would have done justice and not just random pictures a week is sufficient DCJ but by Wednesday she should have filled
kholisile Gubuza,she is guilty and she took part in corruption
Luckey Binali,apparently her brain is connected to the tire she knows that this commission is a spaza Shop
Hangwani Phaswana,"Shakoane SC is at pains to defend the indefensible
Siyanda Ntloko,What kind of lawyer doesn't ask such important questions? The commission should and must operate on summons henceforth. The rules permit and the circumstance around that also necessitates such. When the commission has totally collapsed? @William Pieters What did Plato say? 🤣🤣🤣 "That much is accepted @William Pieters  @SACR FOUNDATION Are we watching the same commission? Exactly @Mbuyiselo Malahle one's integrity and reputation is stake... Summons on the way
Vish Govender,The witness {A Judge} has such scant regard for the commission. The accident is a cover up and a layman's manipulation of processes. LAME. She must get a 4 ball Judge Mlambo must suspend this Judge Mokobele
Yoga Life,This is the biggest joke .... welcome to ANC rule of law Another sad day in our country
Simon Tshifhiwa Nkhumeleni,the judge is riding the commission

sam Mokobane,Maybe she wished the Tyre bust had killed her...:virtualhug::virtualhug: This kind of incompetency is even worse if committed by a judge.
shumba tau,I didn’t know you can buy minister by whiskey and chicken Who captured the country and who sold it I don’t know what are watching here
Duduzekile Nkwanyana,@ Sam i think the same too. @ Njabulo i think I should check the google maps for her address 😂😂 I feel so sad if people of Makhubela's caliber can act this way. I feel so sorry DCJ Zondo
Margareth Waterboer,What is her first name How can this woman still be a judge "I agree "Exactly "You go "This is an embarrassing situation... please judge Zondo
saulo lesoga,"She must come
SACR FOUNDATION,“Why did she accept appointment to chair PRASA when she had already been appointed as a judge?” "Raymond Mnyamezeli Mlungisi ""Ray"" Zondo the Deputy Chief Justice of South Africa. does not have face mask today."

Fx Technical Signal,"XAU USD GOLD the yellow metal is consolidating after hitting a fresh 9-year high at $1898. The near term resistance is around $1900
Mandla Mngomezulu,"this remind me when i was a candidate Attorney in 2001 this Counsel should learn that Zondo is getting upset now and he should not argue further. DCJ Zondo is trying so hard to keep his cool. if i were judge Makhubela i would tell my legal team that I am kn my way to the Commission 😀 @Dominic 😀😀😀
NICO LEBONA,is still look down. she need to come tomorrow.
Mkhaya Sho,is Makhubele in any way related to Mkhwebane?
David Mageva Makhuvele,@Mkhaya why relations? "Judge is spoiling our surname
Luyolo Sithole,Gud day fellows Why this Makhubela can not come and dance for her music she seems to run with a very crucial information this guy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
katlego wasp,@dennis oldude by the time they finalise it..he will have millions of provident fund.he wont have anything to worry about even if sanctioned. this little guy is a bit disorganised @Level Ground Boerboels those lawyers from streets post..who are charge R49/per hour this poor dude also doesn't know what he's doing there..he was told to wear a suit and a mask. i hope she is watching this mess..her mess Red tie magic only works when it is worn by that KZN mafia the dude must get in his polo vivo and not come back.. Tyre punctures are traumatizing.
Gabisile Mabuza,the DCJ is ballistic

Derick Mampuru,I'm still not hearing what he's trying to say 🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️
Sipho Owen Ndhlovu,the wheels of justice are not turning faster because of attitudes like Judge Makhubele to the commission
Ayanda Khonzi,"Not a waste of tax payers money @Level Grond Focus on the essence and leave the phenomenon. EG. You talking about a waste of tax payer money & others talking about the lawyers papers. @Level Grond Focus on the fact that Judge Zondo is not impressed &wants to get to the bottom of this ASAP. And the poor lawyer there is representing a Judge & his client is out of order "@Level I know "@Level: So I was also responding to Sylvian and someone's else while I was at it. Now there is not need to call me sick
Siyanda Senti,ummm...errrrrrr...ummmm.....errrre....arg !!!! ohh shame ...
Miranda Valashiya,now this is where she realises that no one is above the law. she is now wanted yo come in person no more excuses.
Quinton Ndzinisa,If only we going to see more arrests
Mbuyiselo Malahle,"What's so difficult in saying to the Chair "This makes the whole process a joke "An experienced lawyer would know what to expect and advise his client accordingly. Instead it's the client advising the lawyer what to say. In law school "Asked to advise our clients "@Siyanda "It's amazing that a judge "Agh
wim louw,"Surely the commission must take cognizance of the comments in the chats We are being hoodwinked. Our intelligence made a joke off This commission is toothless(and spineless). No recourse in the event of a witness not showing up. Sheer contempt! "New dawn
Dominic Przybylski,Have they adjourned for a friday buffet lunch? @SABC News Thanks. This country is nothing more than a playground for corrupt gangsters. Did somebody corrupt a tire? tyre Tyre is a victim who has suffered? Tyre was injured. How long is mourning period for a deceased tyre in South Africa? Tyre was punctured. Air was bleeding all over the place. Very traumatic.
Cishile Zokukhwabanisa,I used to have SO much hope in this commision. But it has become a farce. The criminals are calling the tune. TSEK
SABC News,@Dominic Przybylski it is a short adjournment to allow Advocate Shakoane SC to consult Judge Makhubele. The sitting shall resume shortly We resume
Tshepho Raselaya,she can run but she can't hide...she must just appear before the Commission...
David Tuer,If her lawyer withdraws she will demand time to brief her new lawyers. It's called the Zuma manouever. @Musa I am sure the DCJ has the same thought.
Derek Govender,The question i would like to ask is why are these people not treated as suspects arrested and allowed an opportunity in court rather than this comm So what is the purpose of this comm @Nkosi.its a duplication of processes .Already over 700 m rands spent?? But the matter will still have to go before a judge in court @Nkosi Da Perf This comm will drag on till dooms day without an outcome....POLITICS POLITICS POLITICS
Tim Hooper,This shouldn't even be up for debate. Unless she is in ICU she can get in another car explain herself "Emotional trauma my foot @Mohamed Mia it's 2020!!?? lol @Mohamed Mia lol 😂 exactly get her a scooter!
Gwyn Matthews,send investigators to fetch her immediately send defence force and air force to escort her issue warrant immediately straight!
Wilson M,so a tyre burst! She must be made an example of! his voice 😂😂 what circumstances 😂
Ivan vries,a judge?with these kind of excuses
Phathu Maqavana,Deputy Chief Justice - DCJ
Tom Thumb,Zondo can apply his mind and issues a warrant of arrest for contempt of court or hearin
Lawrence Selepe,"The sooner Zondo his powers to subpoena The commission must also compel Zupta to appear and finish his testimony. Time is of the essence.
Sthembelo Majola,whats the name of this counsel what are you saying kahle kahle wena nkosi de perf mbize ksasa chair @Dominic Przybylski 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ben Fraser,We have had a total loss regarding the commission of enquiry this whole week. Period.
igshaan haron,sorry
Eugene Trollip,BUT THE CAR HAS FOUR TYRES - SO FOUR WEEKS
Hilton Walbrugh,Respect for the DCJ. I hope that her Judge President also acts accordingly.
Mike Moja,it's tough hey
Braam van der Vyver,She's off the hook. All so predictable.
