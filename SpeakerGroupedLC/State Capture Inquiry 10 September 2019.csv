""I'm the main man"" Famous last words" What was HGM's response to the letters he received regarding his outstanding matric certificate??? HGM sounds like a hospital orderly saying he has experience in operating theatres for 30 years. Just doesn't mention that it was as a porter.

Siyabonga Dladla,"Yeses this guy's accent is quite thick "Also "@Gee Peex1 Yes The way his afrikaans acent is so strong I'm surprised this oke can even speak English. What's the relevance of this witness to the Commission? Can someone please assist me here Here we go
jasper dougal,"Once again this commission uses weak Evidence Leaders against highly dubious lying witnesses  They tend to use the same Evidence Leader throughout the day . Not seen change of Advocates when new witnesses are sworn in . Where are the more Senior Advocates like Melaka gone to ? "How to be stunned into silence  "I think that there should be a cauldron of warming embers placed under Hlaudi’s feet  We need to have Hlaudi singing like a canary ! Or may be not . He’ll have a choir there quicker than we can run I think Hlaudi’s testimony is largely going to be all about his magnificence ! And our failure to recognize it "I think this gentleman’s testimony is being used to put us all in a coma  Shame we can’t vote witnesses off Lol "We should be allowed to make a submission  "I think DCJ Zondo is quietly sleeping while this is going on  "They are trying to bore us to death  "I know this gentleman can’t help his stutter  Hlaudi is busy polishing that halo he plans to put above his head ! "How to drag out something that should take a few minutes  "If anyone is looking for the truth  "Sorry I’m just that much hated being  This man needs to give up on the word Wrong ! Or am I wroooooog ! Who stays sitting behind a mountain ? I prefer to climb it "Noooo How come when you want them to take a tea break they just keep on going and going and going "Oh no  Those damned Installers ! Who would have guessed ? "Sounds like you guys have got more Protests going on  "Lastly  Yippee "Oh nooooo  There you go the extended tea break ! "Did you see how quick Zondo moved there  "Waiting for when they suggest adding the tea break to the Lunch break  "I think Hlaudi meant to say his head hurted  He has yet to explain what it was about him that two people felt was unique enoghh to excuse him his metric All praise and bow down to Mr Alvin Too painful to listen to this bullshit ! Amazing he is leading hearsay evidence "The obfuscation  This is going to be a very long afternoon How to use many words to say nothing at all Well the level of leading is abysmal ! Zondo is outrageous in asking a question and then giving the answer ! In fact why have Hiaudi here when Zondo can answer the questions She is making a poor job of this Metric thing
Yongama Mdleleni,😂😂😂 Head hunted Head hunted be clear History maker @ obie Obie 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂 A day 😂😂😂😂😂 we need healthy journay @pastor J😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂 Eeeeyyyy 😂😂😂😂 What is that’s insulting??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 push 😂😂🤣🤣😂 I will beat you 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂 😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂 Haaayyyiiii 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 I will submit

We need the truth was it accredited? Abet pls go to abet COO with one week course. Why are we shocked though? We voted Zuma into presidency without matric. @Derik main Majority makes decisions for everyone. Zuma was your president @Keith Is like we were bewitched @Derek Main Lol. Thats why we have xenophobic attacks in SA. Our leaders have no basic skills. Zuma tendencies of victim mentality No one was better than Hlaudi 😂😂😂😂😂😂 There are many white people in senior positions without education DA chief whip has no education whatsoever Zuma and Hlaudi same whatsapp group BBBEE
Derek Main,@jasper dougal But how do you know who the next evidence leader will be? @Gee Peex1 Probably - looks like he was at school when the education system still worked. Hlaudi is not mentally stable. He looks guilty. Why is he not wearing an orange jumpsuit? OMW - and he ran the SABC no wonder the SABC is such a mess He hasn't got 41 fingers "@Sidney Setati Not so much of the ""we"" - the ANC fool voters did that." @Sidney Setati Still fools. Why does he squeak like that?
