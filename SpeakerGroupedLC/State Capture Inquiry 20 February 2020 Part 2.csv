roza,how do we listen to court case nd here
Prince Charles,@Roza essack we use the offices of MI6 It is also on Sky I think Donald Trump can make SAA great again
Anne M.,If you have a PC or laptop you can open 2 YouTube sessions @Roza essack I don't know if you can do it on a phone. Somebody who knows phones better than me will be able to say yes or no. "@makhosi nobhatyi Maybe they are on the ""The Enablers"" report recently submitted to the Commission." @Smart Guys Can you have 2 YouTube sessions open on your phone? That's if he is paid anything extra. He might only be paid his normal salary. @Mbuso Ndlovu Now you are just trolling. Am considering doing the same "@D Thomas Yes * 100% @Chosen One What about PWC and Deloittes? @D Thomas And even DCJ is a bit confused by his statement. "@D Thomas Yes That's why he gives an annual report (bemoaning) the high number of qualified audit reports and the numbers don't seem to be coming down. "@Immanuel No "@Immanuel My profile photo is actually an old meme of a child talking on a phone saying ""No Grandma @Mtokozisi Baleni Mr. Polani Sokombela from the Auditor General's office @D Thomas I don't think it's unreasonable. I'm a bit puzzled why they appear to be tip toeing around some of the issues.\ @Lex Luger I was wondering the same thing last week. I haven't seen her name for quite a while. "Yes @D Thomas Now the going concern is very briefly mentioned .... "@Bonang Sithole Sadly "I was laughing at your comment Bye
makhosi nobhatyi,Please investigate nkonki holdings it maybe Zuptas companies
Smart Guys,on your phone go to u tube
Mbuso Ndlovu,i wonder how much money Zondo has cashed up already because of this commission😀😁😂😎😀😁😂 Zondo will be rich at the end of this nonsense commission😎😎😎😎😎😎😎 What about all these lawyers and evidence leaders?? Zondo is charging per Hour😀😁😂 That's why he likes to ajourn I think Judges are overpaid look how big is Zondo😀😁😂😂😁😀 We need to investigate Judges also!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why are they not being investigated are we scared???????????? White judges are always sentence blacks even when there is a little evidence. We need to get to the bottom of this. Der Clerk must come before Zondo to explain Apartheid
Vuyisani Sikobi,"Zondo is not paid a cent Ratio analysis and/or trend analysis should be able to foretell a looming problem

D Thomas,@Anne M we are now on the issue of qualified reports you mentioned earlier @Anne M I mean they deal with the qualified reports "@Anne M "@Anne M "Anne M "@Anne M "@Anne M "@Anne M "@Anne M "@Tennis Van Fee @Teunis Van Ree sorry misspelled your name
Chosen One,Why is that abantu abamnyama are always implicated. @MIKE DURBAN we will have a situation in which people are attracted to gov posts for corruption purposes. We should have qualified and ethical people running gov.
Rusty SpyGoat,@Mike Durban it is the leadership of the political parties i.e EFF that have set a precedent of being racist in the public. And unfortunately people take that to mean that they too can be racist
anya van loggerenberg,catagotories lol Maybe Malema is on drugs @clive oconnell you got that right 👍🏻

Yes. bcos she was tooo pretty and not interested in his nonsense...@Immanuel hahahahahaha Yes I will. an what do i tell katie?@Immanuel My silly sense of humor@Anne M. will get me imto trouble soon enough have a safe and blessed evening all
Sandile Mkhonto,Going concern affects the presentation of the Financial statements.
Paul Buchel,😎😀😀😀
Vish Govender,It appears the AG was protecting SAA instead of doing due diligence Any business that is allowed to continue when it is clear that it is insolvent shows that something is seriously wrong. especially when others may suffer because of this. So the AG needs to explain.
Singi Mathebula,Auditors got captured as well 😪
