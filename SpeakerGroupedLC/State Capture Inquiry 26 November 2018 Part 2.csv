dave east,is the land ready👍 hey thando my boy
Donovan Peters,They were asked for proof before Pravin opened a case. "EFF are reverting to their ANCYL days "This guy does not like ""processes"".He was supposed to answer questions but asks to give a statement." He still has to answer Adv. Maleka's questions. What Manyi fails to say is the Guptas were naturalised Indian S.A. but now they claim they fighting for the guy in the township. "I hate ppl who talk the talk but when you look at the trail they left Manyi talking about black business is like Zwane saying he never stood up for the Guptas. These ministers-Remember the ANC being silent when the Guptas were alleged to have told a catering firm to make sure that the ppl serving them are white. "thato please please don't side track the debate He defended the inclusion of the Guptas in BEE at the expense of the S.A black businesses. No haters here.He still has to answer adv. Maleka's questions. "If Jimmy had the money to buy Maleka allowing Manyi to paint himself into a corner. Thato to tell so many lies that you can't remember the last from the first. There is always context to documents no matter what. Already complaining about the impartiality of the commission. peter pott -peter pott-ANCYL in Red has yet to bring any evidence. The Guptas were never black S.A. they are Indian imports and those defending Manyi should be ashamed this was never about BEE.
Superhero in SA,Cannot open separate cases. Malema must witness here. PG case not related to State Capture. Malema's is. He will have to take on PG at this commission. Admitting guilt PG corruption case not linked to State Capture? The one Malema is opening tomorrow oh I thought all state capture will be covered here PG acting in his official or private capacity? They bringing China to keep people stupid
Tobela Ntshibongo,Malema thinks we are babies. last year he marched several times defending the expulsion of pravin. Now he's telling us that pravin is corrupt/ Which is he talking about. Malema is a distorted politician. pure useless Thando that's what propaganda does. It has reduced your ability to think logical and analyse the whats going on into our country @Donovan Peters if you can share to us when did he stand for guptaz i would appreciate @Thando Nkutha im yet to hear you engaging criticaly. Lol thando where you from @Dumisani Tshuma purchased illegaly? I think we should ignore Thando.
Mfundo Kunene,"lol "Malema blows with the wind @Nkululeko Njapha only stupid/brainwashed people do @Nkululeko Njapha to actually think Malema'sfollowers/sheep arent stupid is what I would call bordering on stupid/naiveity "@Nkululeko Njapha not calling out people for stupidity is what leads to the rise of clowns "we shouldnt hide the fact that some parties/leaders arent gifted with the best senses. its more of a popularity contest "@Ntshibongo Tobela exactly! we are more concerned about personalities "in as much as @Ewald Kruger may be a descendant of my oppressors "Judge Zondo doesnt look like he has a firm grasp of this enquiry @Donovan Peters you could be right. hes allowing him to speak as much as he can "lol "ay Thuli @Lesedi Ditibane all of them lol Maleka is mean lol he's a mean one this one 😁 he's panicking "help the Gupta brothers people embraced THA 😂😂😂 the people 😂😂😂 they embraced TNA cause it was new and fresh dude dribbled himself into a trap a new player came 😂😂😂 fresh!! got a bigger cut of the pie before any objective analysis was made transformation agenda 🙄 "its quite hard to justify subjectivity
KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU,"This guy despises treasury LOL. Understandably "Manyi despises Treasury merely because "DOWN WITH TREASURY @Mandilakhe Afika Centane You know what? He despises Treasury because that was the key gov department to process funds for Guptas "@Sthakathi Khumalo He very convincing  "@Thando Nkutha People say Manyupta is convincing LOL. He blocked me on whatsapp Twitter back in 2015 @Lesedi Ditibane Glad you can see some of his traits... He's Dr Arrogante lol "@Thando Nkutha This guys think he's clever above all. He blocked  "@Tobo Lwandile LOL. He runs like a jet... Correct "@Thando Nkutha Jeez Manyi justified Nkandla... justified Guptas landing at Waterkloof... and now? "This is very broke @Thando Nkutha Jimmy is only able to convince the blind. or the fools lol @Khanyi. AgeGracefully LOL... Thats Jimmy for you @Lucky123 Thwala You mean Jimmy? LOL "@KD Sibisi All companies fall down just after Zuptas ran out of steam LOL... He's now talking about newspapers but Maleka is talking about TV "@KD Sibisi Maleka is talking about TV He is a deluded man @KD Sibisi @Khanyi. AgeGracefully Oh does he tweet? He blocked me back in 2015 "@Ewald Kruger Imagine parents "HAA HAA @Ewald Kruger LOL "@Ewald Kruger Parents = Guptas @Ewald Kruger You get my analogy? @Monique Jones Hey sister! @Monique Jones Hope you're well 😃 "@Monique Jones I am okay Stigma on New Age was well painted because the newspaper was owned by Guptas... Hebaana>???????? @mvubu1234 HAHAHAHAHA! Blowing smoke indeed "Alternative view of a media outlet COME ON MANYI!!!! He loves all the Gupta owned media outlets LOL Come on!! What is the role of the media? To be soft on government? Hehehe @Monique Jones LOL TNA was a propagandist small media outlet... who owned it? Guotas... COME ON MANYI!! @Martine Engelbrecht Indeed! It should be a breeze LOL. Now its boiling hot for Manyi!! @mini @Monique Jones He inherited the GUPTA owned media @Monique Jones pOSED AS IF HE BOUGHT IT lol "@Mbulelo Bikwani Its Monday "Media is there to hold those bestowed to handle our money @Thando Nkutha LOL @Thando Nkutha What is Zondo is on about? Why one media suffered from gov advertising? Why? Out of all newspaper? Answer is easy... Gupta owned media doesn't deserve gov advertising "@khathutshelo mathephe I am confused @ROYAL FOREX This Maleka is a boss💪💪💪 ZONDO?? Whats going on??? LOL Zondo now protecting Manyi? The very same Zondo that legalised MARIJUANA? Manyi cannot compare Media24 and ZUPTA media? The revenue stream differences are massive! "Comparing a Zupta media with Media24 advertising revenue gains is stupid. Its like comparing a spaza in township "Oh gosh @ROYAL FOREX Zondo is now suspicious today Zondo legalised Marijuana anyway "TNA is a small media company "@mvubu1234 LOL... He's making donuts Comparing City Press with that poor New Age is appalling @Bongani Pasha "Yup... very old and solid relationship with readers.... The Star LOL A wow to a newspaper we knew its owned by Guptas? "Justify the unjustifiable Manyi "@Joseph Makofane Manyi says you guys said ""wow""... this is new paper! LOL" Old and very well trusted newspapers.... can we deny this? 😂😂😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Manyi says we appreciated New Age....Come on!! LOL @Monique Jones Great dear. Have a splendid time with her! 😂😂😂😂 @Petrus Father Mnguni Agreed! He thought he'd bully them They put the breaks on him now They've put the breaks Manyi is not happy at all.... blood pressure is up 😂😂😂 @Vlerkies You mean the New Age? LOL "@tererai chipango lol... Manyi too
Nkululeko Njapha,@ mfundo kunene if you think no one takes malema seriously you must be living in different country. Not that i follow Juluis it is reall naive and bordering on stupidity to suggest that follwers of juluis are stupid or brainwashed. "all i am saying is you have every right to disagree all i am saying we must be mature in our debates lets not insults those that we don't agree with. put facts not news paper headlines I think Thando you are challenged When you are mature and thoughtful. you will know that no human is infallible. If you spend all your time looking faults it something don't expect to find anything else. give up on giving us what is happening what do you mean he must give up* that why i said Thando is challenged Exaclty Lucky people have already made up their minds and willing to listen not* Listening is a very important skill Thando crook or no crook he has credible documents and not join the dots story. wonder the chair did not ask mzwanele to mention the names. Pravin was here for Three days no one was complaining convince people based on poetry lol lol Mzwanele hes being honest. he is giving context he said balanced reporting
sakhile mtshali,Mzwanele is clear is a diamond! "i'm loving this Mzwanele dude
Mhlanguli Dlodlo,Who was heading Treasury when this 90/10 exclusion was effected? Manyi is enlightening bafowethu
Ntokozo Cele,This guy just killed PG 90/10 is killing us This judge is not himself today I'm not sure nje... I love Manyi Poerty lol "But the hypocrisy in you guys Zondo is compromised Zondi having chest pains *Zondo Zondo has a vendetta on TNA
Ewald Kruger,"Quite right "👍 👍 👍 @Mfundo Kunene​@Ntshibongo Tobela exactly! we are more concerned about personalities "😀 😀 😀 @Thato M​Manyi is dealing with the ruling elite BEAUTIFUL @Thato M​@Ewald Kruger who is this descendant of the oppressor in my mentions? 😀 😀 😀 dead "👍 enkosi bhuti! @Mfundo Kunene​in as much as @Ewald Kruger may be a descendant of my oppressors 😀 👍 @Thando Nkutha​ @Ewald don’t even waste your time with that idiot "Pressured Speech. Rapid and copious talk Manyi may have a serious personality disorder. I am not even sure he is acting @Monique Jones​Jimmy is clever at acting stupid "Not sure I follow you now @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU ​@Ewald Kruger Imagine parents "😀 😀 😀 get you now @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU​@Ewald Kruger Parents = Guptas Oh how POETIC you are Manyi 😀 😀 😀 😀 👍 @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU​TNA was a propagandist small media outlet... who owned it? Guotas... COME ON MANYI!! "😀 @Gomo Miya​but this newspaper stories/ dialogue between Zondo and Manyi are wasting our time... 😀 You are not following 😀 😀 😀 my word Manyi is not following Zondo AT ALL kwaaa...... No @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU​Zondo now protecting Manyi? 😃 Zondo is giving Manyi an example of how WRONG ANN7 treated Zondo himself 😀 😀 😀 😀 now GICS is not to be blamed hahahaha He is using petrol @xolani mzolo​Manyi is trying to extinguish fire without proper equipment It is vast but justified 😀 😀 😀 This guy is a smooth liar Now it is transformation as well 😀 😀 😀 😀 👍 @Nelson Musoliwa​Or must we say Mayi is mechanical with the truth? Run Manyi run baleka wena your pants are on fire 😀 "Exactly 😀 @holylady1000​who supplied the government with this lady telma 👍 @nkosi khumalo​Manyi is opening a can of worms
ofhie Muofhe,"i stay in limpopo Venda Mr Manyi has a point
Sthakathi Khumalo,Thando Nkutha Its not that people just follow characters.. some leaders provide evidence and we just comment based on their evidence I love how Manyi is giving us backed up documentation!1 KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU In your case who should we believe?? Because the people weve been relying on are not helping but the only guy who seems to point on facts also present documentation. Manyi speak and we will engage your facts! White collar coperate capture!1 Thando Nkutha seems like people have dealt with you regarding your lifespan of debating.. Thuli Madonsela haha peter pott he emphasises again Yes Manyi!! Manyi is frustrating Maleka Why cant they challenge his evidence "There is no grave "Monique Jones And as a professional lawyer Thats what you get when you dont entertain someones evidence as a alawyer. Maleka can ridicule but he must challenge him on his evidence Are we on cross examinations now or what is going on here? Thato M I am lost also Hahaha credibility of Journalist cannot be trusted the essence of this Maleka and Manyi though.. love their relationship Manyi lecture him Is this cross examination or evidence being led??? Now we are debating marketing But Daily Sun really!!! This is not on nje If only Gordhan was examined to this point.. we would be far with state capture!! Maleka and Manyi tjoooo Manyi is economical with the truth haha But he has atleast brought something for us to think about Mlaeka is checking the law haha
Mbulelo Bikwani,Legislation uses equality instead of equity. "There's something called oral evidence and when people know that what they're doing might be viewed on the wrong side of the law There's a difference between leading a witness and cross examining a witness. Pravin was being led and Manyi is under-cross examination. The chair clarified that he can explain but you can't explain every question. If the question is: Is it Monday today? you need not explain the answer. @keith That's not the question. The question is: is it monday? "When you give evidence from a defensive perspective Zondo is being impartial and trying to balance issues. It's cross-examination Maleka is a very experienced cross-examiner and he's one of the few that understands cross-exam. Well Maleka should show that the witness's version was that TNA only received 4.7% of the R199m. You don't talk too much when you give evidence. You must just say enough. This is called goal post shifting. Zondo indicated earlier on that the witness's figures are problematic. Maleka is saying to the witness: you came to tell us that this narrative that TNA received and gobbled all the budget was false. However he can't deny that in it's league it gobbled all of it.
Lucky Dlamini,"Classic stuff! It puzzles me how some people hate Mzwanele so much but still ettentively listen to his presentation. I admire Mzwanele's courage to tell his side and risk being persecuted by haters. True @sakhile mtshali "@Mandilakhe Afika Centane That's not you area Mzwanele. hawu manyi....whats wrong now?? I think Mzwanele is tired now. they need a tea break. Shut them down!!
Thato M,"Manyi is dealing with the ruling elite @Ewald Kruger who is this descendant of the oppressor in my mentions? Mention the names Manyi. "@Thando Nkutha name calling is an apartheid mechanisms. Our forefathers were called names for many years. Engage the substance @Thando Nkutha speaks without any substance. He dismisses anybody he disagrees with by name calling. Forgive his intellect @Thando Nkutha we don't expect you to - with that reasoning @Lucky Dlamini indeed "@Marvel Ramatshela yes @Nelson Musoliwa was there a requirement on his part to? Have you reported banks who are untransformed today to the Police? "Maleka can relax "@Donovan Peters ""paint""?" You realise Manyi struck a nerve when the media and its WMC lackeys are here in defence. "Hey but white people People make statements without substantiating. Madonsela received an email to the Guptas for an invite. Manyi. Manyi!!!! *rom *from Manyi for Minister of Finance Takes one fools to see another. We are not dettered by name calling. Bring it on. "Beautiful answer Poems!!!!!! "Maleka is not the law We care about the turth "Uncontextualise In and out Love this guy "Manyi is great Lyrics 😀😀😀 Iyooooooooo!!!! Madonsela will soon respond after Stellenbosch has given her the go ahead "Everyday "Tangible Manyi is bringing the other side of the narrative White people are always attacking people labelled by the media as corrupt @Thando Nkutha that is your own limited reading of his inputs "@Thando Nkutha whatever makes you sleep at night. The idea that your narrative is gospel and can't go unchallenged is a myth. We engage Cabal of 4 big companies. "Manyi "Manyi "He must contextualise "FEEL FREE "Maleka knows with Manyi going on Mainstream media gets things wrong @Michael Jackson couldn't have said it better Zondo is showing bias. He will be attacked by the EFF for this Sorry who is Zondo saying interviewed him when he started as DCJ? @Kizito Ncube absolutely "Deal with him Manyi!!!!! Adv Maleka is having his monies worth for the first time "It is longer yes baas "Manyi has wonderfully put the media into the spotlight "This will lead hopefully Chairperson is raising pertinent questions on the role of the so called 4th Estate. Some don't see it's importance Manyi: Maleka doesn't understand what he is talking about.!!! @ROYAL FOREX what are you saying? @ROYAL FOREX like ZAR @makhosi nobhatyi how do you know @makhosi nobhatyi you've got jokes! Basing legal submissions on that. C'mon City Press must come answer... Don't speak for them Adv Maleka "This question is useless. You are comparing a start up with an established business with its history dating back pre 1994 "GCIS ""Telma"" IT system. Another huge IT system possibly scored by white business given the name" "Manyi is correct Adv Maleka doesn't understand this simple principle of target market & LSM "Who are you targetting "Adv Maleka is clutching at straws Maleka is looking at the numbers without understanding the background that goes into giving business to various media houses. Bottomlinw is: A LO OF PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOW AT TNA ONLY GOT 4.5% OF THE GCIS SPEND & THE REST WENT TO WMC MEDIA "IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT MALEKA IS ARGUING Maleka is arguing R 8 million was lot. when Naspers got R 17million and Tiso Blackstar R 11 million. This is a joke. Deliberate strategy by gov to go to black owned media. Why would spend still go to white owned companies? Transformation agenda. "Maleka is nuts Thelma is an IT tool but can be overlooked by the committees. Dar "I like this Maleka seems to think only in law does one have different service providers / companies TNA must comeback.. I hope Manyi get the free to air licence "TNA breakfast Thelma is a tool. I said this. It can't be over ridden! "It can be over ridden "Manyi Manyi 10 vs Maleka (-1) Maleka is worried about his credibility with Manyi taking him all over. Maleka will want a second day to revise answers and re-attack. Thought so
Sibusiso Mahlangu The Brand,speak those names wena...
peter pott,intelligence cadres are at play here. they are feeding both manyi and Eff with information hard to dispute by those involved. instead they attack their persona no one in the legal team is challenging him on the names. What are they scared of? "@ngesi "@thato m ☺☺☺pictures He has answered it. the court haven't found them guilty "adv maleka 😀😀they are going to fight this two.

He will answer like one. and this will frustrate you manyi is purposely irritating maleka. wait adv maleka the day julius comes to the commission. He may come with your girlfriend name😀😀😀 "manyi "if this set up templates are continued to be used. previously disadvantaged are screwed in this country. they will issue a tender and say "@nkutha "@Peters they hand them over also at airports. "there is no law "no who wrote telma. You see corporates create guidelines and we quickly agree. they know majority will fail give us the law chief
Strini Naidu,"pfa wat nonsense he is zupta big crook crook Automatic numbers not adding up
Nelson Musoliwa,White collar corporate state capture; who r involved and what is their modality for they need to account for any wrong doing like any one else. Manyi when was this corporate capture detected Did Manyi ever submitted his white collar corporate state capture to any establishment before this comm was established Manyi got right to answer the way he chooses but truth will never get hidden at all. To defend oneself is different from giving testimony. We will see this later Manyi has already cracked as he is struggling to distance himself from the advocate questions and it is his attempt to defend himself from all this Manyi really is trying his best to defend himself from this matters i think he must be released to the police and dish his lies there Broad day light lie from Manyi that govt dished over a million in its first year than all other newspapers and that only TNA was the only one to advance transformation Manyi is yet to be convinced of gupta shenanigans in SA as aksed by adv; he will never be convinced because he knows it by himself Or must we say Mayi is mechanical with the truth?
Dumisani Tshuma,I don't understand this guy who bought Gupta companies which were not purchase legally
Jabulani Cebekhulu,Crook anxiously waiting for cross examination time has been wasted here singing the old song this manyi is fambuling he is a stooge of Zuptas
Marvel Ramatshela,part-time advisor..🙄 He's wasting our time "We're paying R22k/day for venue of this commission "Acting up won't assist him anyway. and he must stop being dramatic Clown's explanation What is he saying mara? "One can lecture such as he/she wants during submission. But during cross-examination
Vuyisile Ngesi,he still has to respond to questions by Adv Vincent Maleka Manyi should answer questions..... Manyi must take my data serious Maleka is gonna take Manyi to the cleaners..... Data is expensive and Manyi's approach to answering questions is not doing justice to the my 2GB ---
sylvester january,Why is this Dude buying time let Maleka on board and see what you have for Mzansi His running scared his making himself a victim Zondo knows what his doing especially with a witness like this Clowm Manyi who thinks that his got all answers
Martine Engelbrecht,wonder what it feels like to waffle lies ok you made your point. bla lbs bla Can't someone whisper in his ear that he is making an idiot of himself Is this guy for real 😨😨😨😨😨 "If you are telling the truth I don't see many white person talking at this commission. Lies are told by black and white. Stop feeling sorry for yourself And he is lying They stole from everyone Which ever way you look at this. This country is in trouble When the people are starving like in the rest of Africa where will black and people run to. It is coming

Was in hospital ER all evening with mom. She's okay and stayed the night with me Is advocate Maleka trying to hide the laughter on his face behind his hands? @Sthakathi Khumalo even lawyers have a sense of humor when someone is lying and it's showing badly @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU he's ridiculous! I'm sorry but just answer the questions not make up your own "A ""loaded"" question is one you are afraid of answering truthfully and hence will incriminate yourself" If you really payed attention you will see that Jimmy has lied already. He said he struggled to pay attention to Gordhan's testimony but yet he says he didn't watch inquiry Mama always said it's hard to remember your lies cause you have to tell so many to keep up with the first one Who are the lawyers on here and why are you not working @MALUSI vukani I don't think so much as bored but the audacity of his lies is funny. He needs to watch the tape later Wasn't Manyi's purchase of GuptaTV7 and TNA financed by Gupta Holdings @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU He's a spin machine getting caught up in his lies @Mbulelo Bikwani buy why is it Monday? Is it because the mainstream WMC media says so? I say prove it! "So Manyi doesn't want to answer when he's caught in lies now? ""You CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!""

Philani Mhlongo,manyi akekho ignorant he is just being honest Manyi is chowing them stru are u guys so desperste to be using daily sun as evidence? this is the best cross examination so far
Mpho Kgomotso,"which manyi is this one now? cause he sounds different from Manyi who was stating his case? is like under questioning
Thapelo Motabogi,"why is it that this commission has more questions for certain people and not others "people should understand that corruption didn't start 5 years back "is this revenge
Moitheki Makhafula,iyooo Manyi bathong Manyi is undermining Adv Maleka
Lebogang Mogotsi,Manyi wa bangena Dats True Ntokozo people a hypocrites LOL! Thatha Manyi
Callistus Khathali,precisely Ntokozo. I am annoyed by the questioning of Maleka. I was hoping that he will rather take him to task on what he has said "Maleka is being hammered here. Shattered when the statement ""there are dates"" - FACTS
Thando Moroka,This mzwanele just acting stupid he know exactly what happened to our money.
Khulekani Dion,People are still going to get crossed here because we are going to testify on those gordan things.Since they were always right without fact.
thembeka shibe,"you know the way Manyi is giving answers he will end up digging himself a grave and the end he will feel like he was treated unfairly Can Manyi concentrate on his evidence and stop giving judgments on others peoples evidences "even if you can say 'Manyi you are wearing a navy blazer""
hilton modike,tna was never saving job was for a looting machine lol manyi trying to protect himself from himself 😁😁😁😁 but he said yes 10% critical of state 😂😂😂😂😂 jimmy is caught this guy is a liar lol mara thats what he wrote .so now its catching up with him 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 lol jimmy manyi 😂😂😂😂 but the Gupta's were also reporting bad about the anc more specially if the people they were portraying negative were not part of their faction gerry nel is not the kind of person to build south africa

Ipfi Nekhubvi,Look at Maleka lol "But what Zondo is addressing is what is happening at the moment in SA Media
Asanda Mndende,The lawyer is weak Pravin was given a chance to elaborate on his answers This is nonsense Mr Maleka is weak people very fair. Pravin did not receive such u friendly environment. jimmy must be given a chance to explain The fact remains that all media you can't trust Jimmy is destroying this state capture. the state capture never existed. it's a mith just because the evidence does not suit you. it does not mean people are Zuma loyalists this Maleka Guy is biased
Crispian Gallon,thembeka. Mzwaneli sounds like a Saint telling the advocate its unfair to answer with yes and no only 🤣🤣
Kopz Koape,Dumela bathong Down down pravhin ..Is this operation tikka masala??? Naledi pandor is next..Also fire the sleeping minister with the Afro Zuma is the mastermind of state capture..He should be on trial for state capture Hopefully the ministers appearing at this inquest will be punished DA members are probably involved in state capture case State capture is embarrassing for Mzansi.. Where is Thabile ngwato if anybody has seen her tell I'm looking for her..I might marry her.. uyazi @Khanyi..ke grand..I'm love with Thabile and she works for SABC @Lerato..Wa ren fela? yawn @Lesedi..Beautiful yellowbone..This chat is boring but your presence makes it interesting

howie bester,why were they allowing Pravin to lecture then?
ashlee ka ndlovu,i don't see a reason why not Manyi can contextualize his answers others before him went on and on to a point i had to rethink what was the question to bigin with
Malusi Zitha,but Manyi is just running around the bush and you can even see tht Maleka is getting bored @xolile macingwane there is a difference between explaining so to give clarity. and a difference with explaining unnecessary things. he says it TNA @xolile macingwane i understand that but we will then have to give Manyi 3months to be cross-examined if we can allow him to explain out of contest come on guys this guy is wasting time Tell him the truth Maleka this guy is just arrogant and acting dump Lol the guy is being exposed here This guy is so embarrassing you know...He is not here to help the commission with finding the truth he is just protecting himself with lies @Thami mdluli Maleka is not weak he is reading what is submitted to him by this liar and Manyi keepson saying that he cant compare what and what of which is just lies Lol people embrace new things by wasting the government money? how cheap is his defence cattle of fish lol

Fransualdo Kasonda,Manyi is so defensive he is mad
xolile macingwane,"But its not fair to request Manyi not to explain "@MALUSI vukani this is not a trail Mr Manyi is by far the toughest contributor to the commission. He is not from the status quo😀
Walter Spatula,WMC!!!!! Manyi spinning @Asanda Mndende ...And you can't trust twitter
Walter Nceba,iyii
Peter Rangoanashi,new age interviewed him
Kizito Ncube,Jimmy emphatically hammering on facts..... Jimmy Manyi is schooling folks maleka playing into manyi's hands and getting highly emotional and personal maleka is being bloodied by manyi Zondo dissecting issues for comprehension . Manyi is adept on intelligence overload Manyi is helping comission to discard untruths peddled by so called credible witnesses we all know mainstream media is and was anti governement .Why would they in all reason owing to transformation still go to mainstream media Manyi explaining in detail with vigour and zeal the rolls Royce of FACTS Some people lack cogent argument .....
Nkosinathi Sihle Shange,😂😂 😂😂🤗 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤗 manyi😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗

Lerato Mohale,Zondo makes sense. just like how the media doesn't challenge Pravin to answer EFFs questions as he's obliged to do as a minister
khathutshelo mathephe,Zondo is trying by all means to kill the momentum of Mr Maleka and now shows that this stzte capture inquiry will waste lots of tax payers money more than what has been looted already "@Keith Silindile Dinabantu  Im starting to believe that lies has a way of coming out wow Things are starting to get tough for Manyi I have a huge respect for Advocate Maleka

Unathi Notshata,Manyi must come back tomorrow

Sipho Mahlangu,@mvubu1234 unamanga lol
JK SEDU,Manyi and TNA did very well. The only problem is that he didn’t partner with WMC. SA will remain a racist country forever. Bantu Education killed us. Why not look at white media as well??? Compare with other service providers. Why focus on the Asian supported media only??? WMC media owns our brains period! Is the fight about the money which should have gone to WMC media?? Teach this poor Adv about the markets marketing and focusing. How can you use Daily Sun to market government programs. Daily Sun is about witchcraft Daily Sun is only for Witchcraft This is the fight between Indian and White business on African soil. We are just used to cheer those with strong media presence Can you sell government programs on Daily Sun next storied about witches? Total madness This Commission is about preserving the past and pushing business rivals of our Oubaases out of SA. Period Give Oppenheimers allthe contracts then peace will prevail in SA. The rest will do only catering and stationary as usual Take all those businesses and give them to the Oppenheimers please! 🙋🏾‍♂️ But why did Guptas try to steal our Oubaases business?? I was risky Tiso Black Star owns Zondo Commission The Citizen benefited from apartheid
