Ndayizeye Jhon Samsoniko,flow fr cptn
Justin Paulse,lol @lindey
Nyasimi Geoffrey,@Paul Mutinda Habari za kwako ndungu bongo vipi @Gee Peex1 how are you today we havent engaged since friday hope you well
PETRIT TV,hello
Hilton,leave the fishing out of this Paul...lol
Born free,Naidu did not start his career in the Police he was employed by one of the persons implicated in this enquiry and then given rankings by the same person. Non of these Police Intelligence are qualified persons they were simply employed and promoted very quickly. So should Malema be Investigated. The pot calling the kettle black. No-one owes Malema anything The Witness is picking his nose
Dan Bourne Yeshurun,I think the commission should close in on captured journalism "with credit crime* give ppl benefit of doubt. the country owes Malema a great deal regardless of party affiliation play the ball before you play the man. this its why corruption thrives because the fight back is divided. think #zumamustgo March what hasn't she. she's basically a politician don't impeed any way she was found to be partial by the courts Karima but they didn't mask his voice lol you can tell by her reporting "why is it so obvious that PP omits Ace from frede dairy her guests bring it up and she shifts topics lightspeed fast @ LEX right. but u get my point Gee? "lol read up haha. I was cosigning someone. saying easy to see PP(BM) omit Ace from frede report but ppl don't notice certain journalist omit BOSASA donations and fake contracts I'm just so sorry the Red throw their weight behind this New PP üòÇüòÇ "Busisiwe: _""I'm doing my work""_" what happened to Maleka guys? he came with the fire crime intelligence went into real estate aswell @Sean see Pelle jacket$ they had scams around sq footage lol its open now the 1 guy who seen a sentence why the. Liberation Movement or the political party? Not the same entity before and after 1994 counterfeit teabags must be investigated. DCJ is sick he bled to death internally he left it open for your interpretation Pastor that's the one that needs to start the REAL clean sweep churches are party to proxy funerals. shameful man did not die. sorry to say Normal everyday black business take a lot of blame for ANC messes I don't wanna say who I believe was threatened by Hani between The vision of a rainbow nation and Absolute ANC/intelligence & control .. can only be so many suspects rubbed out many tires following Mdluli correct I was about to say the same @ Pastor bruh Batohi needs a Batman signal to begin her work. Batohi stepped into her role on the ticket of speedy high-profile prosecutions.. so far I count zero if there isn't enough evidence to close the book on Esidemeni then who exactly is going to jail for anything else? "a Zuma literally got away with murder because although he was speeding in the rain NPA is Lion with no teeth or claws co governance is the only effective we can hear you Batohi is on working holiday feedback "imagine the reason for not 1 prosecutuon NPA the public's only weapon made futile I almost laughed when I seen the Hawks swoop down on Agrizzi. I wondered if they got lost trying to find their way to ANC people too many Lazy ANC loyalists still clinging to old age dominating the majority at the polls self sufficient living residents is the government's worst nightmare. The Land issue will sit on ANC desk forever land and economy is a narrative being peddled. you can do fine with got family sustaining yourself or your community
Pastor J.J,Hearsay evidence is admissable in law when it can be collaborated. @Gee Peex1 Yes. Especially if I say that Tom advised that he committed a crime and Tom confirms that he did say so. It is no longer hearsay. @Lex Luger Same here my Precious friend @redriger ...They only become admissible if the court exercises its power to admit hearsay evidence under Law of Evidence Amendment Act. "@redriger Hearsay evidence is not admissible in court unless a statue or rule provides otherwise. Therefore "@redriger Generally @redriger In my 1st message I did say that it is accepted only when confirmed as truthful evidence and collaborated @redriger You are right. @redriger The bulk of his evidence is based on facts and 1st hand information where he was present or involved. The hearsay is not being explored but further investigated as per DCJ "@redriger Remember when he throws those bits of infoaround in the manner that he does @Crown Glass and Aluminium Thats a very intelligent comment. Thats exactly how I see and hear this evidence @Sean Johnson I hope so. I have a leather jacket @Brother Louis That is the reason he is in Witness Protection for 9 years. He started spilling the beans for 9 years now. People have been fired and criminal chards are pending @redriger Dont be misunderstood. Witness Protection is possibly worse in many respects than Prison. @Brother Louis Thats correct. The crooks were protecting each other like blood brothers. @redriger Dont forget to remember that Naidoo was unskilled and unemployed when Gen Lazarus employed him in CI has they are relatives. @Nicky Klue Offer us a guess @Thulani Bukani Hi brother. Nice to see you here on the chat again. I pray you are well @Thulani Bukani Always my Brother @redriger He was placed in WP by the SIU not CI. He may be safe for now @redriger Thats correct.Roelofse is not from CI @redriger I honestly dont know about him. I liked Chris Barnard though. hahahahahaha @Gee Peex1 Have you ever committed a crime and what was it? @Gee Peex1 and then ate it? @redriger Every bit of intelligent evidence so far seems to indicate anything but a suicide. But....... @Gee Peex1 Did Gavin Watson commit suicide or was murdered? @redriger That in itself creates every doubt about the suicide theory. But then again more sinister things have happened in this country. The question like who killed Hani comes to mind again @Gee Peex1 You just may be on the right track @redriger I am in total agreement with you @Bronx Wavy Absolutely right my friend @redriger I have my thoughts. Hopefully we will see one of them BACK at the commission soon @Bronx Wavy You are indded right and justified to say what you did. I agree @redriger Chris Hani would have very likely have become President after Mandela. Foloow the short trail from there @Thando Nkutha Welcome back my Dear Friend @Bronx Wavy Say it. Perhaps you are braver than me to start the conversation @Gee Peex1 Blackie Swart was a Policeman in Security Branch @redriger That and an element of fear of being ecposed for what happened in the training camps etc @Gee Peex1 That was Whitey Basson @redriger and Zuma as President.......... @Gee Peex1 No problem. Today I will be your instant encyclopaedia hahahahaha @Yolo More I am a recently Retired Pastor. A real one @Yolo More . That was a pecular question? @Singi Mathebula. hahahahahahaha @redriger Yes. @redriger Yes and I wondered what was the trigger @Yin Yang Brilliant my friend @Yolo More . Thank you kindly my Precious friend. I am just a simple person who reads a lot with many years of life experience. thank you for your kind words @redriger . Probably. The man who knows most is one Tokyo Sexwale. He knows a lot lot more @redriger That was a convenient convenience. Financially and otherwise @redriger ??? "@redriger Dont forget that Tokyo""s wife Judy was very very handsomely rewarded in the divorce settlement" @Heather Cotton Spot on. She knew tooo much @Singi Mathebula Absolutely right @redriger There was many and still are many honest ones out there. But they are suppressed. The fact os that if honest Prosecution took place now we will not have much of a Govt left to rule. @redriger At some stage soon.very soon.there will be a major upheavel. Hopefully I pray it will be peaceful. People are deeply frustrated @Gee Peex1 Follow the trail.The Seriti Commission report and findings which was favorable to certain parties was recently set aside by the High Court. @redriger This beautiful country and its wonderful mix of people will overcome and be successful and respected very soon @redriger South Africans must always be Patriotic and never cease to be believers. We have the Foundations of a beautiful country and the most wonderful people in it. Why not "@Danie Nilsen Yes you right Danie. But we must deal with some big issues. Crime @Naledzani Mashau Each of us have a choice. If we can find our way to the Polling booths the we are given the gift of thought and decisions as well. You are right @Thando Nkutha Personally I have always been poor and still am. That is my entire motivation in life. To serve amongst the most downtrodden. I have never ever earned a single penny in Ministry.Truth @Danie Nilsen Absolutely right my friend. Every South African irrespective of race etc should ultimately own a piece of property. Thats an Ideal which can be achieved if we chose to all work together @Thando Nkutha I believed and still do of the Giving rather than the Receiving Philosophy. I am poor but blessed and happy As we close may I wish you all a blessed and safe eveningüôèüôèüôè
Terance Nzuza,What if criminals are sometimes released to commit crimes.... 40G this is messy what if Zondo's name pops up? anything is possible...Zondo is feeling the seriousness....it wont be business as usual in our SOE Mdluli's smile...he'll take all SOE down south with him... If intelligence refers to mind state/capabilities....how is academia immune here....who processes these processes?...i'm writing an Epi.c the guy is sweating....
Oscar Theo,yes chair they do mhluli is not happy with every car he get aye wna Naidoo you are a puppet nxa
Norman Zwane,"So is Ranjeni Munusammy a journalist or a secret service operative? Ditto Mzilikazi wa Afrika @Lex Luger Is she a journalist or an operative? @Lex Luger Oh maybe she's just been demonised by the EFF? This witness does not know a blank cheque @redriger The guy was just an unemployed relative more blunt than a butter knife. He don't know an assumption from a fact or a blank cheque. The guy was a dangerous fool that would become a snitch @Bronx Wavy Give this fool a few more hours and I'm sure Mkhwebane's hairdo will come out as paid for by the spooks slush funds @Brother Louis None what so ever - just TALL TALES @Bronx Wavy Zondo's star witness @redriger Jeni was an open 'SECRET AGENT' @redriger I'm on a popcorn binge myself @Gee Peex1 HOw the wheel turns @redriger As a witness he is Mdluli's passport to a case where the state cannot prove its case. If I was Mdluli's attorney I'd be praying the guy is the state's chief witness. He'd tie himself up. I've run out of popcorn guys and this is boring. Cheers.
Kay Kay,Zondo's humor is entertainingü§£ü§£ "hallo online analysts I read someone wrote about Mzilika waAfrika and Piet Rampedi here on the chat. are they also named? he's contradicting himself now Are the Hanekom attorneys related to the ANC Dirk Hanekom? "Gee Peex1 But will his evidence not be reduced to nothing with a thorough cross examination? "@Bronx Wavy "@Brother Louis "@Redriger Are we done for the day or what?
Smart Guys,Zondo is sharp R40.0 R40.000.00 is Karima involved guy's all audios Gee it's now 16.15hrs 9.45 tomorrow üëç
Bernard Matolino,@Norman Zwane What has Karima Brown done now? @Pastor J I am very well mfundisi. Sending you lots of brotherly love!!!
Speckled Trim,Ok heard enough from this witness. next! Witness is wasting g *state resources Conspiracy theory: 1 Witness is not being entirely truthful OR 2 Witness was coached and not given enough info. Where else would all the assumptions come from? This witness' testimony will be taken with a pinch of salt. His credibility is doubtful. "a lot of smoke "He has absolutely no concrete evidence. And the issues seem like fraud ü§£ Norman agreed 101%. Many of these issues should have been raised/reported internally. Why wait so long... "@Pastor J thank you for the info. This means that investigations were ""frozen"" and never pursued by any leader since. Quite shocking!" "@Kay Kay "@Pastor J it's sad. This is common practice everywhere. ""Turning blind eye"" :(" 530d such a nice car see ya Norman "This investigation can potentially go on forever and cause the downfall of many public officials. ""State Capture"" seems like a lazy way of describing all the corruption by willing participants." "Most of the ""connections"" come from pro-democracy days. Same players." *pre- Are they finishing later today? Witness testimony feels a bit MIA Feels like we already have covert co-governance ü§£ "Who here still reads the Sapafiles? Some nice info on SA history scratching speakers
videoboer,sjo but these guys are skelm and corrupt They have houses in Clifton

Kevin Simon,The only part of the Crime Intelligence moniker that is correct is the Crime bit. The Intelligence part is a misnomer.

Cameron Shaw,wits going on bois
Jean-Pierre Le Roux,Eskom burning pensions because they burnt their money long ago
ENTERE,Can a leather jacket be gangsta I really want to know can a leather jacket be gangsta
Yolo More,Don't lose focus guys.The fact that some of his evidence is a hearsay does not necessarily mean it's not the truth. This is corruption by people who were supposed to fight corruption. Pastor J are you real pastor or a journalist? Pastor J I expected only John3:16 from youüòãüòãbut you are well informed about anything. You are so knowledgeable. Pastor J an encyclopedia indeedüôèüôè But the advocate is not bad at all.

"I'm not sure I follow @Austin Van Rensburg. if a person is dressed like ANC @Austin Van Rensburg you're gonna have to tell me what im missing my guy. @Austin then we are saying the same thing. Black south Africans didn't do this. it was greed from ANC guys and their friends. what's there to look deeper into?
