Chuma Mtyelwa,"He looks more like Chris Hani""s killer"
Fight Ndwa Munyembani,he looks like Oscar Pretorius
thabo Mavundla,he looks like Walus ..
Magda Seguin,This guy was summonsed And Mti Sondolo is a subsidiary of Bosasa....they had many companies Watson ran Bosasa with an iron fist from what I can gather...all of tge witnesses says the same thing I think it is about the IT provided to the bribed entities Why has there been no search and seizures of Bosasa offices yet...the SIU and Hawks have evidence for decades He said that the SIU was onto Bosasa...he was protecting himself
Dominique Bester,a real all in one i wanna see her movie: no - you need series he is white demoted now i talk aweh Tiaan watson mafia add more bro watson ran a moerse Spzaz Wats on Gavin? you dont wanna ask the Adv check or savings when she want to pay... @Eslon: al in the mind... they owned nothing thats why they demoted you bro... they saw your weak spots.... but i got yo back hi david
Eslon Eslon,"Ewald This commission turn out to be more like a Bosasa enquiry it seems Is Watson the owner of Bosasa or is he's just a CEO Co-founder without signature what does mean?@Khumalo All along we were throwing stones to the Guptas while Bosasa the main culprit was in the game long time This too serious Gavin Watson must be summoned to this commission Mr. Chair This one was atleast wise enough to make copies I hope he has those copies in his possession till day "@Sipho Cebo Zondo wanted to confuse this guy to say things he wanted to hear. He's certainly telling like it was. For me he's not lying at all how the state capture was designed and engineered? 1. Bosasa founders decided let's work through the ANC that's the best way. 2 Bosasa picked JZ and his handlers to facilitate the mission
Derick Mampuru,who's the adv? "the volume is quite low the untouchable Gavin Watson hmm
OomStu ZA,agreed thando this soap could put sabc back on the map is gavin watson watching this live feed i wonder? PLEASE INCREASE VOLUME ADMINS!!!!! forgive my ignorance but will the like sof gavin watson also have to appear?

"Watson wanted to give everyone a chance He is the co-founder of Bosasa without signature rights imagine Watson Watson... this guy must be a genius to convince all of these comrades to sign things and yet his one does not appear in most of these corrupt acts Agrizzi uhh They just want to implicate Watson these ones "Chair says if you are afraid of Watson why didn't you raise issues with Agrizzi and he has no answer BOSASA Leadershipreminds me of DA; put a black face while they run the shower in executives positions "Agrizzi is the biggest Tsotsi here As for bye bye eh...
Sipho Owen Ndhlovu,he cant smile as he is about to incriminate himself its not about competence of work its about competence of keeping secrets and being trusted on the shenanigans they were doing this guy looks like janusz walusz
Buyiswa Mnyani,"this guy is going to commit suicide he doesnt look strong @Seipati Constance you read my mind abt SOE. i was going to say allegations against Lynn Brown are false she is not mentioned here. 😴😁 @Zibi Pumla uboya bam abulali yile advocate....???????

Malebo,"Tjo weee ET "He gets employed Bloody ungrateful. he is complaining but he was taking money all the way. Gavin should employ me. Loyal all the way. The other Van Tonder was ET's father I like Watson too. Atleast they were being abused and paid well 😀 This one was not paid that well. No fat cat here Too maar.

Phillip Moshapo,Guys why is that it is ONLY whites in this BOSASA enquiry "grant wilkinson "Eslon Eslon
Antonie Goosen,Funny how Bosasa still relied on White men to do their evil deeds - wonder what their BEE status was lol @ Yandi Masina Makes sense as management seems to have been entirely white - and still they got tenders lol @ Magda Seguin they have protection from high profile ANC members @ makhosi nobhatyi Haha True !

Lee Majiya,Nthabiseng Malebo😂😂😂
makhosi nobhatyi,Bossasa white monopoly company "No we are just saying the truth of the matter even their board only one black person Van tonder? @Edward Kruger me too I noticed that bt his fears for his life because Gavin Watson may hunt his life

Mzalwane Mzala,@Tony Jantjies No number one owns Bidvest. Its ownership is listed Subpoenas are starting to have effect
thandi twala,the state was seriously captured
roberto wilco,"Bosassa was a white run company but they had the whole government captured through corruption  "If i was Gavin Watson id be out the country his gonna go to Jail for a very long time  This is just like when they catch mafia members do you want to go to jail or do you want to rat to save your skin Yes Eslon The ship is sinking they are getting on the liferafts Agrizzi is a mastermind he had his get out of jail card Phillip his not my hero he should go to Jail his kying
