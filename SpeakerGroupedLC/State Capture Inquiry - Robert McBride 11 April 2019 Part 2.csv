DJ DJ,and we back @peter sikoshule the money will never be recovered not enough to help this country out
V. Xanko,Robert McBride
Nobantu Shabalala,we back
The Vuka Experience,Hello
kevindbn007,this guy will have plenty of info on all the ministers "problem is but these ppl need o be held to account
Conquering Lion,"Them all
Sindiswa Moolman,Especially former SAPS ministers @kevindbn007 Charges... Some people’s names here give an impression that they are intelligent until they say something. It’s really disappointing. High risk of stage 1 of load shedding Did e die @Magda Seguin? Yhooo And who is the problem and has to be removed @Dumile Mateza
Dianne Quinn,"For an informative background "@magda yes https://amabhungane.org/stories/saps-wars-part-3-bheki-cele-robert-mcbride-and-the-mysterious-mr-marimuthu/
welton paulse,Jirr i remember the fight between Ntlemeza and Mbalula Is he saying Mrs Mbeki? "@Mzalwane Mzala 
Thulani Bukani,Ok Robby. Let’s go fethu. You reckon people are gonna really end up in jail? The guy is gonna tell how state policing and prosecutorial functions were captured. So let’s keep our fingers crossed.
Wildthing,better start building lots of jails. yes if the course of this enquiry is to fix SA then yes. and corruption gets death by hanging. he will get his job back if what he says here is followed up and actioned and then they would want someone with experience back to catch the others. here we go
Magda Seguin,Julian Arrange arrested.El Bashir resigned ...news of the day @Dianne I read the Amabhungane article...The names are all there @Bongumenzi...capture of the state judiciary "Sheila Betohi is going to fast track state capture prosecutions  It is the so called Zimbabwe rendition She is the new NPA Director The rendition was a set up against Dramat and McBride @Spindle yes..it was a mistake My autocorrect seems to be active I need to delete it again @peter read the Amabhungane article...it is very long buy explains everything @peter...the rendition is just ONE example of state capture It shows how McBride and Dramat was being falsely implcated as they were deemed hindrances "Those against state capture was flushed out...just like at the SOE's...they were either suspended @mvubu 1234 my sentiments exact You are right Anne M...IPID oversees SAPS @Peter why do you say so?What do you know? All the names are coming out!..All of them are in the Amanghubane article @Thapelo it's all in the public domain for 10 years That is why it is called Independent Police Investigation Directorate...Nd Bride was the Director until his contract was not renewed recently by Cele He is mentioning names!! Ntelemeza was Head of Hawks who sent Gordhan the 27 questions after he was recalled from London on an investment trip and then dropped when Zuma reshuffled Parliament Not parliament but Cabinet Some Sunday Times journalists was used by the NPA to publish leaked info...I think General Booysen will still testify after McBride @gerald people don't realise how enormous the damage is...billions upon billions of taxpayers money including tax evasion by Zuma and his friends It lool It appears that Mr Pretorious has a chip on his shoulder with McBride...they are both from KZN Captain Lemoer is a criminal Phiyega tipped Lemoer off about his eminent suspension Maybe Mbalula's name will come up too..he was Police Minister.Ntelemeza wanted to interdict him once That is because Mbeki was in the UK and then Russia and Tanzania in exile Mbeki was mentored very closely by OR Tambo The ANC had 24 years to make Alex a beacon of development instead they stole the R1.7 billion Mbeki earmarked for the Alex development Now everyone wants to blame Mashaba who have been only there for 2 years.. The ANC likes using dirty tricks...only the brainwashed are fooled Both Mr Pretorious and the Judge are hard on McBride...seems like the brother's implication is a factor @Oupa right now in the US Mueller is investigating Trump...it's very ugly.You can listen to US Congress hearings on YouTube...three of Trumps lawyers have been jailed already. Half of Trumps initial appointed government officials have resigned or was fired. Corruption is a global problem...even two of Brazil's ex presidents are in jail @Cerebis Barr has backtracked...he also only gave a reduced version of the report. Everybody in the US wants the full report to be made public. Remember Barr is a Trump ally @Tony it's a dirty I really honour the people of Sudan in the way they took so Bashir down...they came out in their hundreds of thousands since December 2018 until he resigned today @Cerebis...look at all rhevinterviews of prominent US citizens on all the tv stations apart from Fox that Trump use as his mouthpiece... The Dems are actually lame ducks apart from when Pelosi refused the wall money @Cerebis follow AOC and the Young Turks on Twitter and you will get a picture of Trumps madness I am only on Twitter for the credible academic work I am involved in but I also take note of world affairs as I need to know the political dynamic to do my work including the financial markets. @Robert I can't sorry @Robert thanks for the compliment. I always maintained that debriefing is important for proper integration @peter There was a commission to look at Phiyegas tenure but unfortunately the Judge who led the commission died halfway and it was never made public Phiyega was suspended due to Marikana..I don't even know if she was finally let go I saw that No Shall will also be testifying...Remember Zuma sacked him as Chief of Intelligence and appointed Cwele Apologies Mo Shaik @peter pott..he is fighting to get his job back..CR appointed him Head of Integrity last week at Parliament He is NOT fighting to get his job back.. I don't think he want to work with Cele after what happened @Peter pott unfortunately the writing is on the wall...we are stuffed unless citizens rise up as in Sudan Even the Algerians ousted their aged president after three weeks of protests..he was president for 40 years! In SA it is the entire ANC government that must go Amen...it's the only commission where the evidence leader stands the whole day! The venue is not accommodating Gwede goes where the wind blows...he was an ardent Zuma supporter Mc Bride was interviewed but obviously IPID being founded on confidentiality he could not shout it to the world...most of the people who came forward didn't make a noise If they made a noise it would have given fuel to fire to vilify them more Context in this commission is crucial
Bridgette Kekana,@Micheal Wild 😂😂😂😂
Kapn Krunch,I think every south African needs to take to the streets till justice is served not just for the nyumpis but for the big boys like Zuma until they are prosecuted we will never see the end as what do the next in line have to fear how can we are we cowards ? are we so easily quelled by a show they put a circus to make us happy ? is this what south africa should settle for I geuss so UBUNTU white and black is how they redirect our anger that is meant for them it's time for justice from Zuma to everyone we must even put Mugabe in chains should he ever dare to enter our land the time is now to become what we are meant to be or our children will face the consequences nyoape is the result of drug dealers they even make a drug that makes poor people even worse off then before the drug dealers are the result of corruption trickling down here where I live the only ones to chase Nigerians from their local corner it was a small malawian community not the cops not us south Africans it was malawians speaks volumes about why we in this state it doesnt matter what race we are it matters what we do about this corruption we are to docile they legalized marijuana to make us even more docile they believe order trumps justice not prosecuting government officials isn't just a south African thing it's a world wide thing here in africa we are more blessed because over here they are too stupid to go about their business with tact the first time I ever went to a court to bail a friend the schedule wasnt up so I asked a judge walking by the first thing he said was ask for a bribe corruption even in courts is that common place I'd bet my last dollar everyone watching this has paid a bribe before not even for drunk driving ? dont lie I've bribed a cop with a coffee because it was all I had back when I used to drive without a license I hope we are surprised I really do I hope this time next year justice will be served we all knew exactly what was happening when they disbanded the scorpions it's become common place so common place that we accept it the terrorists are just a medium that are used to sack our country there are far bigger players that are never named that benefit the most the terrorists have the trust of the people that trust is merely exploited however if we prosecute those who are named the next person in that position of power will think twice before they do the unnameds bidding it's a step in the right direction that tinfoil hat sits firmly upon my head prosecution will we musnt just send them to jail we should strip them of their illicit wealth that includes those who benefitted from friends to family belief is important if we believe we are powerless we are powerless south africa is one of the 10 countries with the best human rights in the world it's time to start exercising them there's this documentary called tainted heroes it changed my perspective on what actually happened growing up in the rainbow nation school doesnt teach you much about south africas history search it on youtube I'm voting DA I want service delivery in jozi going to cape town is like a different country the taxes without the corruption will ensure equality of opportunity for everyone
Mzalwane Mzala,Crime Intelligence was rotten under Mdluli. After Dramat was fired the case was dismissed. He confirms how crime intelligence fabricated a case against the national and Gauteng heads of Hawks. The head of Hawks was targeted because they had started to investigate certain connected people so they had to be booted out of the service @peter sikoshule He was proven right on the case that he is testifying about now "@Norman Zwane This is case number 1 that he is testifying on. I do not want to speculate on what is still to come. On this one It is a fact that Mcbride did for IPID what Thuli Madonsela did for Public Protector ofice. He fought for the independence of IPD and took Ministers to court for meddling in IPID's work Kuki Hayi @Norman Zwane I must actually leave this and start writing. minister Nhleko who played movies to argue the fire pool case later suspended Mcbride "The demise of the ANC was proclaimed since its formation in 1912 and the ANC still here @Bongumenzi Nxumalo I responded to the word 'demise' and I believe I was correct. @carnoth ngomane let them keep on wishing @carnoth ngomane That Derek is only here to insult ANC and its supporters. State capture started before 1994 Former Minister Nhleko is not on the ANC list for parliament People are making it sound easy to removing an ANC president from power outside of a conference @Cerebis Who are those 4? Renewal of the ANC and the state is continuing President Ramaphosa asks Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi to respond to Mokgoro inquiry report by Tuesday (News24) @Eslon Eslon We can only speculate for now as the report has not been made public. "I guess the president want to consider their statements before he take a final decision. It sounds like the recommendation is to fire them @Cerebis Why were some of them campaigning for Ramaphosa? @peter pott He cant fire them if the enquiry found that they are fit but he can buy them out like Kgalema did to Pikoli @Pheladi Lamola My point exactly Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi have until Tuesday to make representations to President Cyril Ramaphosa in response to a report into their fitness to hold office in the (NPA). (News24) @Eslon Eslon That on its own reduces @Cerebis' 4 I give up @Cerebis . Some of us were not watching from a distance bu were involved in the campaigns.
Bongumenzi Nxumalo,"I know he will probably say what he is here for "If these comrades were then in preview of this attempt to capture Couldn't McBride not have provided this testimony with the Mkgoro commission? Pheladi Lamola It was to probe the fitness to hold office of suspended NPA Advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi "Dumile Mateza True But McBride as much as he is spilling beans.. He must mention names that were behind this attempt to capture everything by any means!! Agrizzi set a tone that all should follow Oupa Zwane I wish I had the answer but I don't.. interesting question Comrades fighting one another through commissions! The demise of ANC "Mzalwane Mzala Its not the total loss or collapse "Mzalwane Mzala My bad "All of this greed can be directly linked to officials doing business with the state
Eslon Eslon,If this commission fail to recommend prosecutions than nothing else will rescue these beautiful country "@jeevan Singh "@Cerebis "@Cerebis "sound Mcbride's confidence is super high "@Derek Main "I beg to disagree with you "@Dumile Mateza "@Derek Main "@Carnoth ngomane I honestly also don't trust Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma simply bcoz of her association with corrupt individuals "@Makhosi nobhatyi "Truth be told. Ace @Mzalwane Mzala. what did judge Mokgoro recommend? That they are not fit to hold office or what? The only person that openly supported CR17 is uncle Gwede Mantashe Since we are left to speculate. I would assume perhaps judge Mokgoro decide to leave option dismissal solely for the president to do or apply his mind independently
jeevan singh,Elson. absolutely correct. Ace Magushle and Zuma are heavily connected in the state capture for years.
makhosi nobhatyi,This how Zuma was starting more to capture the state "Mayor Mashaba failed to handle the situation of residence in Alex president refers him to go and do service delivery said no excuse "Derek main is desperate to persuade people join him Derek main DA Elson Elson I never trust her in the beginning when Zuma endorsed her as his predecessor I said to myself he has a plan to leave in a hands of someone whom he will trust and cover his track which was Going to happen Peter pott was reporting to the president so if president saw his cronies name and his name mentioned in investigation then he will put his own people to cover up fire the head That is how Zuma did Elson Elson I said it back 2017 that she is a product of Guptas when new age newspaper gives their compliment to her endorsement saying she has experience my question was wat did she bring different? They might not like Ramaphosa for no reason because knowing that they broke the law and will face consequences of their action as we see inside the party there are those who fight back
Cerebis,"@Eslon Eslon The new PP is busy putting together the ""New Scorpions 2"" that will investigate and prosecute all implicated by this and other(PIC) commissions." "@Eslon Eslon sorry "@Danie Nilsen No General Booysen will testify on Monday @Fils de l'homme Where is Transvaal? What Political Party on the Ballet will get you that Fils? "@Fils de l'homme So who should your ""people""vote for then?" @Fils de l'homme that will never happen! The Mueller investigation has been completed and it does not recommend any action against President Trump. @Magda Seguin The brief of the Mueller special investigation was clear. Establish f Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russians. @Magda Seguin I think you mean to say everybody in the Dems want the whole report. Some info will be secret and will be excluded. @Anne M. No Watson has be charged or prosecuted in SA yet in regards to this commision. Most of us however hope that they will!!?? @Magda Seguin I stay away from Twitter....it is mostly for Twits. I however believe that Trump is an unstable liar that proves that anybody can become POTUS. "@Val Speirs I agree with you in general "People are free to vote for whoever they want to. But please @Jean-Pierre Le Roux he will first have to finish his golf game on Sunday. 4 of the So called Top 6 of the ANC are Zupta people....1 is uncertain where he stands. The current ANC Leadership means the ANC is the same snake with a different head? "@Mzalwane Mzala In the view of many people : Ace Magashule @Mzalwane Mzala they turned on the Zuma endorsement and saw the writing on the wall??? Nope it does not....I agree with Magda on hashtag Mantashe

ANC all the way otherwise there's no alternative @Derek Main i will take that as a complement and acceptance of defeat @Mzalwane Mzala i work with people like him when they cant get you to agree with them the resort to insults @Derek Main you the one who is defeated hence you rely on insults as you arguments "@Derek Main sorry sir your campaign failed from the beginning ANC all the way @Derek Main if you must know there are credible leaders within the ANC @Derek Main RUN LITTLE BOY "@Khabane Mofokeng Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma

Jill Gomes,no ! go away1
Pheladi Lamola,Mokgoro commission was for what again? So many commissions I have lost count I agree @Mzalwane Mzala. If the recommendation was to keep them CR wouldn't really need the two's thoughts
peter sikoshule,is there any explosive evidence mcbride said since he took the stand? but now fabrication of 1 case does it forms part of state capture? we no longer on state capture. we on rendition case about mcbride friend sibiya mc bride is so bitter and desperate I know he will be cross examined so u guys will understand why I say he is bitter and desperate. Let me not talk too much Gerald I agree with u . this rendition case won't help us recover the money DJ we won't recover all of it but we will get some Norman in the rendition case there was no money involved . it was just saps infighting ( crime intelligent and hawks) and protection of criminals by covering up evidence
Dumile Mateza,@Bongumenzi Nxumalo This evidence is led to demonstrate how state security agencies were weakened and repurposed to serve a particular purpose. Therefore it does not belong to the Mokgoro commission Is giving evidence like an oral examination @Norman Zwane YOU MENAT TO SAY MEASURED INSTEAD OF MAJORED I am actually surprised that there are two or thre discussions taking place on this platform. The whites are talking to each other and blacks talking to each other. Mbeki did not use the Guptas to undermine our democracy like Zuma did The issue i needed to get my head around was that when Zuma came into power he institued an investigation into the State Owned Enterprises. What did the report tell him and hwat became of the SOEs
