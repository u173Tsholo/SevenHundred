Riaan DW,? "Not the best entertainment around LOOT dom people Literally Gerda 8 7 sorry Mamma AFRICA is sick "Pastor "Lol  "Like our old friends Zimbabwe @Naledi Barron If you take the ANC out the equation....probably left with a couple of hundred billion to spend on the Poor.. I wonder What types of people will go and vote for the ANC ...?? "@Naledi Barron I hear you too "@Carl Botha There is probably double the amount of Desperate people nou Has EFF family members started paying back the stolen Money from VBS yet?? Or is this not looting? Every year we see a increase in Desperate people. South Africa in 20 years.... Will we also have 20 Billion Rand Notes??? I have bought a big wheelbarrow to go and buy milk and bread in the future.... "If there is a second wave "Nothing ANC Government might be watching the Voters roll from Dubai with all their assets...? "As long as the ANC can fuel racism Bless Bridges
Carl Botha,"All over the news Just saw the Car Park field Hospital and the shacks that was built in Limpopo 🤔 "@Jenny Whitewaves It works like that in big Corporate s as well I was shocked @Roza essack "@Roza essack When he said he does not accept her excuses "That was a classic case of using the law as an excuse @Naledi Barron We can pray and trust 🤣🤣 I wish @Zakhele Tshabalala The best is CR and cadres pat themselves on the back about their actions throughout the lockdown @Riaan DW Desperate people "@Roza essack Eskom direct "@Riaan DW I agree @Roza essack Wirh Re to Eskom I do not stay in a mansion @Riaan DW there is a difference between desperate and believing the lies and desperate for change "@Pastor J Are you overloading your PA Bianca A with work 🤣🤣🤣 @Pastor J Handing out some PK's 😂😂 @Deborah Ramaphala with no -isms allowed @Roza essack true @Roza essack Unless you want to breed voters. So they will all use this excuse now! Nail him for contempt Zondo Its because you allow it "Flat tyres 👌 Since when do you invite crimminals
Pastor J.J,@Carl...These skelms in charge will steal flowers at their own funeral @Elvis....I have been following that closely and I think the Hawks are at 250 feet and still digging bro. No sign of stopping. This is an abuse by another Politician. No warrant to seize it seems We must get the Scorpions back Elvis @&___Mr_____& ___Abhi_____hy @Naledi...We certainly have more liberties and we scream from the highest rooftops. Sadly most times when corruption is endemic by the ruling party members nobody seems to listen.Arrests must happen If the Asset Forfeiture Unit has sufficient grounds to go for the Eskom Officials and Gupta assets why has the NPA fallen short to do a few arrests? @Elvis...There is perhaps another commodity they have in common Bro @Aunty Roza.....send some samoosas pleeeeez @Roza...I love you Aunty Roza...Always do and always did and always will @Elvis...I will always say the same thing...Batohi is the best the system will get but the surroundings is restrictive....If the ANC is all in jail Parliament will be legislated as a Prison @Roza...She is being limited and held back by those dark forces.Give her real Independence and the entire Govt will be in Prison and she might just send Malema there too as a bonus @Roza eNCA is becoming another ANN7 it seems @Elvis...Very true @Roza The ANC gave the impression she has independence but did not remove the handcuffs that they put on her yet @P>o>I Thats very true....We can do with a few clowns in that place. Or should I say a few more perhaps. @Riaan... I laugh at anything stupid as I am easy to please. So even those cheap clowns will do in these dark times @Naledi......Most of us do but the feelings "@Gerda...did you perhaps mean to say ""The looters of this country""???" @Mathieuw....show me the shortcut to the Ocean so I can drown myself @Naledi I totally agree with you. @Riaan... A big Amen to that I would offer to lead the next Government as President but sadly enough I am a little shy of being crooked. So I dont qualify as per the Job Description.hahahahahahaha @mathieuw.....You and I can start our own Govt but which of us is a crook? Why @Craven @Craven...Dont they all say that just before they become President.....and then...oh oh oh "@Gerda "@Gerda....""I was not""" @Bertram....Brilliant idea...but...half the country does not have electricity to watch....and they sadly are the poor 26 years later and 4000 schools have pit toilets....and the ANC proudly announced that they replace 66 or so. @Iggy...it has become unaffordable even to the middle class so the poor is done for and have no hope at all Gift of the Givers-only with donations probably did more in this country than the Govt. Soon People will rebel and we will have anarchy out of frustration. We will then have change but no one is there to lead. Anyone who says Malema is going home early.hehehehe @Gerda...wrong.other countries do as well but for totally different reasons @Bendiction...Change it to what? @Carl...I have sent them to do a few citizens arrests so we can keep the Commission Diary looking busy Bro. @Carl....Bianca is a no nonsense girl...like those old traditional english nannies. @Sanjay.....A social net funded by what?. We are bankcrupt. @Deborah...Brilliant idea @Riaan...respectfully I dont believe that. The ANC will have a very hard time holding a majority in the next election @Sean....The problems seems to be that the UAE will protect its economy rather than defending honesty @Sanjay...100%correct @Lee...I dont get confused easily but you succeeded on the first attempt.Congratulations Subpoena pleeeeez @Peter Staffen..@Maebye...Infogate/Herschel Rhoodie? a starting point Blessing to you all
Elvis Malakoane,Carl Botha looks like we have a new corruption pandemic with Covid19 PPE pastorj I see Gigaba matter is also backfiring Hawks have a please explain to do "politicians and diapers have same thing in common pastorj true pastor Batohi is not going take NPA anywere "pastorj south Africa needs firm and strong leadership including the president "Gerda7 No Mathieuw Muyenga Malema Nogal? be serious "zakhele Tshabalala afraid for ANC of the* zakhele Tshabalala they make a mistake ANC is finished just need a little push it will over the cliff zakhele Tshabalala true zakhele they are kicking a can down the road They have been intimidated
Jenny Whitewaves,I think the sudden interest by ANC in investigating corruption is linked to getting the IMF money Will be just enough to get the bankers off their back but no real high up who have stolen the big money will ever answer
Naledi Barron,"Hi @Pastor J "YES ! @Pastor J . Unfortunately corruption is endemic in many 1st and 3td world countries. S.A is not unique "@Pastor J. I hear you "Here's the thing. Public Inquiry. All docuemtned "Democracy is a sword with 2 sharp edges. One cuts through the corruption and crime "@Roza essack. I hear you. But ""democracy"" requres ""full exposure"". The world will continue to turn "All everyone can do @Pastor J ​ and @Roza essack . I hear you both. I have no answer. All I can say is that I believe in the goodness of individuals - NOT any government. My humble belief sustains me. "Amen @Pastor J. Small and simple. and @Roza essack  "@Riaan DW . The world is sick. We all need to focus on looking after Hi @Craven Morehead . What's new? Absolutely @Carl Botha ! This world will do as it must. "@Craven Morehead . I love boring @Roza essack. A pleasure my dear!

kevindbn007,But our Government love MESS its quite clear the ANC is only for them selves and ACE's lities.... into big money now....but no investigation I wonder if this ZONDO is just a diversion its 2yrs now....has any arrests been made?

Sean Collett,"It all starts with education. I aks people in townships all the time ""Why dont you toi toi and march to make education a priority?"" Vacant expressions and silence is what I recieve." "The fact that this is an inquirey and not a investigation "The fact that the ANC has not persued all the international channels available to them to get the Guptas to pay up and be put away The state capture probe has cost taxpayers R700m so far.
Sanjay Maharaj,let us b clear. the situation with the rand has very little to do with anything yiu hear. the rand is a speculation investment for profiteering free state sorruption. occupational hygienist "Sean that is a very shallow clichéd argument. education is long term. hunger is immediate. we need a robust social net "as long as we want the USA type lifestyle and do not get down to working together we will have nothing. Singapore has very limited natural resources "in a quarter decade #weraceasone exactly. so we need to focus our attention on the business principles we heard and start small business that will buck the ANC STRONGHOLD ON BUSINESS and us. we have too few businesses in ZA "the DA is a shadow party and has lost its way in the dark. thi was apparent by kakhuisen saying that ""of ramposer does not stop the lockdown the people will"". that was like him imitating Juljus" "@malebye "@zakhele "@bophelo @riaan. spot on!

Bophelo Malapela,"The zondo commission came out of a report by the previous public protector to investigate State Capture "state capture took 9 years not saying commission must take that long but there is a lot to go through "What will be different with your movement why would anyone join So those that are invested here are insane @zakhele tshabalala. Thing about investors is they will invest in a dictatorship if that will give returns they do not really care Right to legal representation is paramount in our law Contempt if he was ordered to appear and absented himself without justification @Abel Matshidiso happens everyday in our courts Banana Republic is used loosely Captured by whom This is a commission not a criminal court "NPA and Hawks were hollowed out @craven morehead DCJ Zondo says they must now look at stringent methods of ensuring attendance
