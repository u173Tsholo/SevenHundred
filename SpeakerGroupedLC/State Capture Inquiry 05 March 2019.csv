Freedom now,a country in trouble!!!!!
welton paulse,"fedility @Desmond Masilela . does that not have anything to do with President Ramaphosa? "This guy looks very much like Mo Shaik SABC as always is proven to be run by Palookas this guy is trying to confuse the commission Jirre SABC making us watching this in chapters SABC is captured SABC is making us watch in SEASONS And this guy talking in circles is not helping us "@Yin Yang someone at Eskom is poking the load shedding button I am telling you guys this is ESKOM's doing Wonder if he was using hands free mode when he received the call. "Someone at Eskom has their finger on the load shedding button "@SABC Digital News like President Zuma once said these Houses and HOMESES "@Kurt Samson  "@Kurt Samson "this guy is dressed by the Guptas Where are those whatsapp messages? Why is this guy staring at the roof? someone hiding in the roof with answers @Desmond Masilela or he is saying Oh Gosh they gonna catch me out @Sofia Sofia very much true Oh crap Koko at it again "@Michael Rijsmus I said it this morning @Sofia Sofia i think its more complicated than meets the eye the Mafia that ruled ESKOM was very much strategic "Problem with corruption of this magnitude @Felix Muyoba . so you say that ALL and I mean ALL Indians are corrupt? "@Felix Muyoba biggest mistake is we tend to generalize people to quickly and for no particular proven fact
Desmond Masilela,Fidelity is the company now know as G4 @Lucky123 Thwala . Yes lucky G4s. "@welton paulse. I'm not sure Why am i getting all this advertisement Guys are you all getting advertisement? This man is trying to avoid the question. @Lucky123 Thwala. This man think his clever. Look at his eyes. Something is wrong with the proforma invoice. People looting the money and they end up changing names. "so all these people that are mentioned here @Thando Nkutha. Then the whole team must come forward to tell us what they know. Aiboo!!!! SABC please fix the problem. I keep on getting advert here. "SABC we cant keep on asking one thing all the time I cant recall This black out is still persist? SABC please @Briony French. üòÇüòÇüòÇ This commission is wasting time with this guy Guys we are in the middle of discussing this guy and the commission here. So this thing of race should be stop. please. SABC i thought you sorted out this Black out during tea break. He can not recall. That is his answer. @Felix Muyoba @Peter Staffen The man can not recall anything. "@Felix Muyoba Look now @Peter Staffen . I get your point. "This is why i'm getting confuse with this guy. if he can confuse the adv You transfer the money to someone now. They tell you it need 24hrs in order to reflect to the receiver. But this one just go direct with no delay. Mine too. @Kurt Samson @Felix Muyoba. Imagine sending such a lot of money and it reflect same time. üôÜüôÜüôÜ He accept it was a wrong procedure but he still continue to do it. @Felix Muyoba. Now the cuts from 659 let them in trouble. This is because of greedy of human being. @Felix Muyoba. Now they must feel the heat. @Felix Muyoba. I'm sure the chair will do so. @welton paulse üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Maybe someone is giving him answers. @Felix Muyoba. Lets hope so because this man is trying to hide the truth. Haiiiboooo!!!! another 728m except 659m!!!! So you mean they must just leave them? with no arrest? Then what is this commission for if no arrest will be done. @welton paulse üòÇüòÇüòÇ The man is scared he think they might arrest him now. He ask the question but he fail to ask why this rush rush of money transfer because that was benefiting him. @Felix Muyoba. yes the suppliers must also come forward. We cant deal with this man alone when we see his telling liar. I would rather do the right thing than do corrupt and things that will let myself in trouble one day. His trying to build his version I'm not white but i can tell that not all white ppl are racist trust me. We must understand something here. Not all white ppl are racist. and you are not born racist but you are taught to hate black ppl. therefore ppl must not mislead other ppl.
Lucky123 Thwala,g4s speak to Mic my man. this bustered thinks we are stupid yeye phendula stosti. this is a problem can't recall he he fulling the system Mara sabc. let's get warrant search for his house we will get money hiding.
Jean-Pierre Le Roux,A CA with deep pockets "@Mzalwane Mzala  "@Mzalwane Mzala 
Mzalwane Mzala,Civil servants are stealing money and you blame the ANC. Mxm He was a politician I find this funny because all the ANC haters want to pretend as if they are now dissapointed by something. You hated the ANC for all these years and that did not break it. The 'broken' ANC's definition of failure in these elections is dipping below 60%.
Derek Main,@Yin Yang True that - either that or they are dof @Mzalwane Mzala Civil servants!?! That's almost as disingenuous as saying it's individuals and not the ANC @Mzalwane Mzala The ANC can't wriggle out of there responisbility for this mess so easily @Mzalwane Mzala What find very unfunny is that the ANC voters have supported this looting of our fiscus for all the years and don't see anything wrong with it. They are all complicit And BTW I haven't always hated the ANC - it was only when it became blatantly obvious that they were in it for self-enrichment only that I started hating them. "I don't think that Indians are any more prone to corruption than anyone else. As we have seen in the last few months "@Indoda Yamaqiniso Besides executing them @Indoda Yamaqiniso Well what's the alternative - just let them get away with it? @Indoda Yamaqiniso Sounds pretty racist to me "@Indoda Yamaqiniso It's like me saying ""All blacks are criminals"" It's a generalisation and since not all blacks are criminals "You also didn't say ""some whites"" - you said ""whites"" which implies ALL whites - thus a generalisation" "Who is ""they""?" @Indoda Yamaqiniso It's quite clear that you're an out-and-out racist @Indoda Yamaqiniso Show me one statement of mine that is racist. I can show you plenty of yours that prove you are a racist I rest my case How juvenile. How old are you?

Absolout It feels like open season for liars at Eskom ! Eskom are like commercials?You can't believe a word they say ! I think if he spoke the truth he might have made sense ..... Did he resign from his position ? Or did he continue knowing what was happening ? @Bridgette Kekana @Felix Muyoba No human race is superior; no religious faith is inferior. All collective judgments are wrong. Only racists make them ! its because of people like @Bridgette Kekana and friends our beautiful country is in shams !

Felix Muyoba,@Van Rural Boy Myeki agree @Tich Ziny true @Desmond Masilela these guys were all accomplices meeting at night? "@John James in the name of clients but the money was coming back to their pockets again it is a messy affair at eskom @Desmond Masilela he was an accomplice in looting eskom as well @Desmond Masilela i follow your argument @John James remember that suppliers will promise him that if you effect the payments as soon as possible we will give you a tip..and then he does that without thinking of the consequences "no man why such a hurry to effect the payments without following the accounting procedures? @Franco Gresele agree "@makhosi nobhatyi no man @Franco Gresele hahaha please you are too radical on this @Indoda Yamaqiniso true and this needs to be changed @Desmond Masilela those guys were all benefiting from that money.. @Desmond Masilela imagine.. "@Christian W hahaha "exactly they just wanted their cuts from that 659 million @Desmond Masilela yebo @Desmond Masilela i wish the suppliers are also summoned to this commision @Desmond Masilela perhaps they (suppliers) may open up more cans of worm just like agrizzi "hau "exactly @Desmond Masilela that is why we need the suppliers to also come and tesity..perhaps they will tell us that we paid him to effect that payment @Bridgette Kekana haha @Sofia Sofia @welton paulse @Sthakathi Khumalo given the guptas saga..i am in support of @Bridgette Kekana @welton paulse no..not all but some @welton paulse but remember the fruit of a tree doesnt fall far away from the parent tree..it might be true this guy was creating blank cheques for suppliers zondo is right..that is a blank cheque prinicple

Pamela Sibuta,what's wrong with Sabc today ".
makhosi nobhatyi,If boss speaks it must be done quickly üòÉüòÉüòÄ
Indoda Yamaqiniso,It looks like 99% of the people at the management of Eskom are white and Indian; all foreigners on our land. It's all talk with less documented evidence here "It's Eskom More jails and even more money to keep them in jail. You must be special kind of stupid. do you know how much does it cost the state to run prison settlements? Sending a person to prison for stealing money is a stupid thing to do as you will pump more money to maintain him/her. I bet that's why we chose not to send Apartheid criminals to prison. "I do not mean anything You can turn to eNCA While the family rejoices that the killer of Reeva Steenkamp goes to prison and justice is being served; the reality says the killer is being rehabilitated with state money. Just a typical example right there. ...if you're smart "Corruption is strife with white people "Black diss one of their own together with whites and when it's a white person in the limelight How is the truth racist? "Hence I didn't say ""all white"" people are corrupt. I said corruption is rife amongst white people and they protect each other no matter what "This thing of being loyal to other whites If you tell them today that Apartheid was the most corrupt system they'd deny it. "Ahh... when you tell them the truth "Whites are naturally racists The most racist are always denying it. Your father
