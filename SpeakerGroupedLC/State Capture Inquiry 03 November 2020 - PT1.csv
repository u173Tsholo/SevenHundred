Adrian Fray,Who else thinks yesterday was lit That lawyer lady lacks decorum. Backyard lawyer. Jirre would not want to be her husband. She makes no sense in her arguments But they really have it in for Ms. Hofmeyer. But she stood her ground well. Loool @kieron I don’t think she has friends thats why she could meet everyone And mbanjwa is incoherent Nou gaan die kk spat On another note is MeteoFile paying for this free advertising
Phil Rambau,at some stage I felt shaim for her maaaan . anc is a joke shame this mama she's tired man.
Dr T Z,Hofmeyer is well grounded and articulate Ms Kwinana is the Manager of the week. kkkk Whoever wrote those statements for her should feel ashamed
Joshua Borias,"""lotshani bakhozi !! let us accept dat by pushing the likes of mev.vetkoek paleis in top- notch positions we shot ourselves in de brain """ """ we embraced mediocrity(mediocre) & frown upon meritocracy ( merit) """ """ ADVOCAAT KATE gaan nou die VETKOEK PALEIS goed TAKEL """ """what a turn-off dat de likes of mev. vetkoek paleis can give foreigners PUBLIC MONEY so they can build a paradise in de desert ( DUBAI) """
Pastor J.J,Yes both the CA and Liar (a.k.a Lawyer at times) are both highly qualified.

TALK SOFTLY SO SHE DOES NOT WAKE UP Is Nyaope a comfort break? @Kgothatso Manale Dr Dhawa is a legal citizen @Rene Ngwenya Some on this chat are extremely intolerant yet we fight for equality as Africans. Its painful but true sadly I suspect Mbanjwa and Kwinana are paid up EFF members. The behaviours is a give away I now know why Goat has not been on the chat for 2 days. She is in the Witness Box @ALTA Are you on Live Chat? @Naledi Barron Greetings my Precious Sister. Welcome to the Land of the Corrupt and Unbelievable @Valencia J Darling of mine. I greeted you at 9.43 this morning @Valencia J We are better off on the Whatsapp group @ALTA I sent you 5 messages today. hahahahahaha I now know why Kwinana's children disowned her yesterday @Mike Clark The Nkandla Rapper still owns that record @Mike Clark They know now...she is the deep one now. hahahaha @Mthokozisi Molefe I am a retired Pastor "@Mthokozisi Molefe Absolutely. Forgiveness is for those who confess @Mthokozisi Molefe That is a subject of personal views and the Laws of the Land. I dont have a view @Mthokozisi Molefe Unfortunately and as a personal choice with respect to others on the chat I chose not to discuss religion on these chats. @Mthokozisi Molefe Religion is a matter for personal interaction and not on something like what we are on now. Likewise you will not be expected to discuss your sex life on this forum. @Jos Hille I was convinced this morning that something like you would make an appearance. @Annie Van Niekerk Welcome back @Anne M. Greetings Anne. I apologise for not sending one earlier. @SanFran Arnold I am missing you much today. Where are you? Please talk softly. MBANJWA FELL ASLEEP AGAIN. Let her sleep. Shem @Anne M. Could be that Lion fellow @Elvis Malakoane I did ask for everyone to talk softly...You see now @Anne M. We should have chatted softly. @Simphiwe Kubheka I tried but ended up damaging the laptop screen. Wii try again soon Praying for Kwinana and Mbanjwa will be akin to an attempt on the Guinness World Record. 2 days is not enough

Phillip Cwazibe,Kieron Sinewave ​the did not that approving the terms and conditions is structuring an agreement. @ Tommygun what is ​it that makes 30% of a pilots duty? @ Xolile Mgidi ​ I think she will show her flames. "@ melds melds ​ very expensive to bring a BEE partner and can be a nightmare. Knowledge @ Musa Mabunda Indeed and their difficulty is that Kate asks direct and relevant questions. They get exposed. @ OS Muzik ​ Adv. Mbanjwa is involved in the SAA shenanigans and seriously implicated in the Bedfordview property transfer. It is alleged that there were forged documents used. @ Belinda Stiging ​ UNISA Tronk toe👺 @JD CROSSON No bias and the commissions receives evidence. Uphi uMs Mbanjwa?? Using 'blackness' to justify her misdeeds. How is it lawful and reasonable if not approved by treasury. How is it lawful & reasonable if not approved by treasury? Why buy fuel from third parties? Why not buy directly from the manufacturer. @ stix molelemane very sad and disappointing.

Xolile Mgidi,Hofmeyr has got a cat in the bag with regards to her saying she never saw the signed version BEE has become a code name for that in this country This lady is basically a summary of what we were subjected to under Jacob Zuma🙄🙄🙄🙄 "Hahahahaha I just laugh when Zondo says ""Yhooo""" Hahahaha but we all know that Kwinana knows that that it was wrong to go on that trip. She just can't admit to it because she would be admitting to a crime How rigorous were these procurement processes if they allowed the board to cancel the tender after having come back from Chicago🙄🙄 Kwinana is not dumb at all. She however has decided to play dumb instead of telling the truth. She would rather be seen as dumb than to admit to crime on a public platform @Bets Fourie There is no prosecuter here. This is not a court of law.

I always thought it was difficult to get a CA degree. Finish her!! @Derek Govender this seems to indicate otherwise. Does it seem like the lawyer was acting as proxy the entire time at SAA to anyone else here? Like Kwinana was in position for the CA degree and the lawyer was the brains. Kwinana was given her position at SAA for the sake of progress. @Elvis Malakoane spot on! 😀 Oh my guard this woman knows nothing Anyone know how much Kwinana's salary is/was?! "Guys @a b c talk talk @Johnno D that's bait LionView is bait guys. Just block. @a b c why bro? @a b c I think I understand. There is something fundamentally wrong with censorship. @a b c respec 😉 @a b c are we the same person living in parallel lives?! @Blake Yogi seems like a CA degree is really easy to achieve "The establishment only wants you to think it's difficult to get a CA degree. It's actually this easy @Khaye Ndlovu my life is made of boring routine. Makes it easy to remember 😛 How many people in SA can get a limousine ride if we take her salary back? @Mthokozisi Molefe if I say yes do I get special treatment? @melds melds you just need a CA degree.

This woman has no moral values. Kwinana will end up in jail and not understand how tf she got there. I would love to have been a fly on the wall while AAR was entertaining her. Imagine what they were thinking to themselves while they were in Kwinana's company. WINED AND DINED - From Fatcakes to Chicago Deep Dish.... (If I was a journalist) 😉 She went all the way to Chicargo and I bet she didn't even introduce them to the ways of the vetkoek. Imagine how many more limo rides and Chicargo pizzas they will get with the R10bil What time is lunch normally? I need to warm up my spag bol. Almost back to pre-bathroom-break viewership numbers Let's talk about it Kwinana DCJ about to laugh out loud. Best put the mask on Where can I download the Kwinani Fatcake Recipe? SASS!!!!
