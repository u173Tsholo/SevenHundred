Njabulo MS Ngobese,this guy hasn't seen anything
Dominic Przybylski,People who say others believe they are superior to them suffer from lack of self-respect. If a person lacks self-respect then how can they respect anyone else? What 'value' did Regiments provide? @Sonwabo wiseman mhlaba Most went to Dubai and quite a lot of it must have gone to Dubai officials to make sure they refuse extradition. RET faction will vote against frog boiler so he will have to rely on support from the boiling frogs. A CA cannot pretend ignorance on this scale. These guys are pretending incompetence as a cover for their criminal activities. Zondo's 'okay' means that he is criminally implicated. How long will it take before this guy is convicted? 10 years or 15?
