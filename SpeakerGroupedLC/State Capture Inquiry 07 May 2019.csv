I judge from the consistent errant male behaviour in SA "I lived in two other countries in Africa and visited twelve "10 years down the line investigative journalists have been writing and nobody cared.The rest of Africa overtook us "25 year olds in SA are instead following the EFF and shout slogans vilifying journalists What are you on about? Yes SA is 4th...do your research SA is virtually bbankrupt If that China Eskom loan don't come through you will be in the dark.BTW Eskom has been using diesel for a very long time..not just recently
Jane .Blamire,Wow lots of lawyers. Some nervous people out there? Can we stick to the commission and stop insulting each other? Agree BEN kagiso BLOCKED
Nhlakanipho Mzimela,Where's advocate Maleka?

makhosi nobhatyi,Is it popo Molefe? "@Zola Pinda thanks "Gordhan always say those who are implicated "@Michael Holmes no you had it wrong I know that where is coming from Malema "Ramaphosa is shocked becoz it‚Äôs hard to accept how municipalities failed to do service delivery Popo Molefe is going to expose wrong Ramaphosa for president no joke Ramaphosa work tirelessly together with his minister to fix these institutions I am listening "@Thando Nkutha let us give a president Ramaphosa a chance knowing we are not giving him blank cheque @Derek main üòÉüòÉüòÉü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I know you would agree with me i accept that üòÉüòÉ "Please guys we still need each other "@Cerebis I know that but that doesn‚Äôt mean president has to choose the rotten egg he will go over if the is no clean potato there many individuals in the Anc "Danie Nilsen it‚Äôs a new dawn "@Cerebis I trust the man "I believe Ramaphosa will change this country to be better "I believe in him I know he can he said izinja zikhonkotha imoto ehambayo emileyo yachanyelwa "@Derek main I understand but I am confident the man is ready @ E Rut South Africa will never be the same again I am giving you my money "@Cerebis he did that to public protector investigation the matter I totally agree with you for the past 9 years things were going wrong everywhere in government and Ramaphosa knows what to do "@Cerebis if he is not doing well I will be there first person to criticize him and even to be recalled no way to defend him when he is wrong Let us give Ramaphosa a chance that is all you will see progression These companies don‚Äôt corporate with you "ANC brings lot of changes in the country but we say not enough struggle continue land "If ANC wins I promise you things has to change "@ Skhathi khumalo what do you want to Popo? The man is highlighting problems he finds there is in a record South Africa was stolen Tjooo @ Skhathi khumalo I understand he is drawing a point how did they finds transnet? With all reports they found out. So that we can clearly see how it all goes wrong "Don‚Äôt be fooled by opportunistic individuals who scored points about Anc
david jacobs,yes Madelein Gone with ANC After tomorrow Cyril Geoffrey Ramaphosa will be re-called lol ag no man once there was the ANC -today theres thieves
Zola Pinda,Dr. Popo Molefe it is.
Born free,Pravin Gordhan was a target of Zumas and Malema's because he was fighting against corruption . All political parties know they have do something about the youth and development and job creation. Just have to choose the party that you believe will deliver. Is Molefe still in Transnet? Turn it around?? let's get to the services... sounds like he is constipated ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î Yes ANC has not changed a thing in 25 years. The reform was about getting rid of competent people who worked for Transnet. BEE Heading for the dark age yes we will and then the Commission of Enquiry will be shut down and all the guilty will never be held accountable. Sophisticated operation to commit fraud and corruption. Tracey is dumb Intelligent people will not vote ANC or EFF Wise people will not vote ANC or EFF Taxpayers will not vote ANC or EFF Tax payers keep this economy alive they will not vote for these corrupt parties. Only because 90% of non taxpayers will vote for ANC and EFF. Africa has been free from colonisation for decades. Stop using that past history as an excuse for Africa's failures. Africans must admit that their own elected governments have failed Africa. The culture of corruption needs to cease. Malema sits with Russian mafia who pays his bills and campaigns. Molefe was supeoned to appear Felix.. Google it. Media has written on this. Torching more buildings and clinics ..watching the news The Bantu arrived in South Africa long after the settlers It never captured my mind but there is nothing a minority can do but watch it go down hill Zuma is Malemas Pappa Malema is a Zuma Not if you want European aid and medicine "That means no retro viral drugs for HIV Address your population about birth control. poverty breeds poverty Haha haha. Don't like the truth about the real cause of poverty Communist China owns South Africa economically When the ANC government can no longer pay its debt back to the Chinese they will invade. I haven't seen any progress in the newly elected government in Zimbabwe. The ANC owes communist China billions Yes Derrick as they did to Mugabe in Zimbabwe and he literally wet his pants three times. By the way I am not from the West my ancestors have been here 6000 years ago. I have never and will never leave my Africa or my roots they are ingrained in this earth. Get to the root of corruption it has nothing to do with the ordinary citizens of this country or Farms. Cyril looks like a bull frog He looks like he just came out of the boiling pot ü§£ Molefe knows exactly the route to syphone funds. If the ANC win and don't deliver we will come after the voters that voted them in power. If the ANC win and don't deliver please don't go burning and destroying South Africa because you voted them into. power again. Well If Ramophosa wins which means an ANC government all over again. If he and his party don't deliver.. heads will roll ANC is Divided by those who got away with corruption and those who have not. The heat is on.. Respect your fathers and mothers It sounds like the degree was from a lucky packet Yes true and the Zulu arrived at the same time as the settlers We are going to do that by voting for the DA All this hate that exists in the ANC and EFF is not going to build South Africa's economy . The bushman are not of the same race as other tribes I have no respect for a party of thugs the EFF Well I know the ANC will win which is so much better than having the thugs of the EFF. But the DA will be a great contender he he Has Zuma you forgot the Indians and the curry favour. he he Indians don't want to be black they want to be Indians and curry favour Now Zuma have you put on your intelligent spectacles??? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Jacob are you Malemas father? I hear everyone wants to be his father.. but Julius got you into power. It's too late the Chinese own the resources The Chinese will invade if the EFF win infact they will do what they did to Mugabe. The Chinese did not need proof they removed Mugabe silently so very silently and peacefully. It's true that the Chinese own Eskom and other state entities so they will have a say in this government. The Chinese are loaning the government R70 billion to build power stations because the world bank will not invest because of corruption. So whoever wins The Chinese have a huge stake in their investment. Stealing will not solve a thing
Moha Yare,tomorrow am gonna vote for eff because of young people development
Thami Ngwenya,"No need to tell us Ask Floyd about his schemes at least ANC is not hypocritical about this mess "Not sure "Power lies to the head Dont call us idiot "I vote anc  "I am listening Western cape shubble from airport "Better stop Idiot do that Yes he thinks we have forgotten NP ressurected fron DA very few rest DA "By the way "Your language shows your colours "Sorry 30% student No it is in private sector not public By the way it is not your symbol that determine your intelligence. 80% is just cramming and bring it back
