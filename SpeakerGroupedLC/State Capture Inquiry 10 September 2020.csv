Fred Desrosiers,Morning everyone. need today's witness to sing. There is no reason why witnesses should not tell the truth. "maybe after seeing yesterday's grilling They should just say 9:00 then could Start at 10. "You have to remember that in 1994 My feeling is today's witness will try to contradict everyone. What she stated so far has no bearing on how State Capture occured Eskom was being runned like a shoddy company

Tefo a V Klein who was on the Escom board. Teddy I get the same impression So Miss Klein did not know the difference between a board and an induction meeting. a b c 100% Sibusiso thank you brother. Hope we see sparks fly. Sibusiso I still remember his arrogance at the parliamentary committee Same here Mondli Sibusiso I hope DCJ cuts him down to size from the start. What a farce - these people in charge of our most vital SOE. Hulle het lekker geskinder Nong Nong jip. Mondli I recall that 'tragic' episode. What an Oscar performance. Thulani this is one drame queen. Sibusiso I also expect that. If she again says 'if my memory serves me right' I am going to sniff Omo washing powder Abel she does not want to share that info with us. Mondli she will come out with the most ridiculous excuses not to attend. She is already consulting with her doctor already. She is staring a hole in that ceiling Sjoe- a simple question and she is is delivering a full speech. Samuel they call it spray and pray. Samuel 😜😜😜😜💐💐 Fireman😜🤣🤣🤣 Just tell the truth and then you don't have to remember all the lies. Why does she continue to protect Lynn Browne. Alfred jip. Mondli so true. Duck and dive expert of note Sjoe what a selective memory. Nape😂🤣😂😂😂😅

Teddy Ntsente,@hirsitus I am sitting here thinking exactly the same. Judge Zondo looks flabbergasted and lacks the enthusiasm he showed during Tsotsi's testimony. I see the Judge taking a sip of water after each of her 10 min responses. I feel for him.
