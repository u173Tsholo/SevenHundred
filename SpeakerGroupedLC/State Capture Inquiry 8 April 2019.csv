Magda Seguin,Really?Why? @siboniso how do you know he is not coming? McBride said in a video that he has information on exactly how the processes at the NPA was circumvented The video is available on Youtube It is clear that the ANC is desperate judging from the Alex saga this weekend.Tony Yengeni made necklacing threats on Twitter against Mashaba CR just appointed Mc; CR just appointed Mc Bride as Head of Anti Corruption Ethics Unit @Yin Yang...I rewrote my comment...I had a gremlin that popped up

Eslon Eslon,Chair is punctual today It seems Mcbride will drop bombshell I'm suspicious why is the commission keep postponing Mcbride testimony outright? "@Desmond Masilela There's something about Mcbride's testimony The commission is duck and diving on the Mcbride issue pointing to the rules but when allowed Agrizzi to implicate Nomvula without notifying her. But Chair you allowed Agrizzi to implicate Nomvula without giving her time to prepare herself why? Investigators are playing games with Mcbride Everybody including the inquiry's investigators are afraid of Mcbride's testimony
Amanda Watson,... and she was charged with defeating the ends of justice and contravention of section 33 of the IPID Act. All three cases are still with the NPA.... "..off the roll in terms of the above-mentioned section. The matter could only be re-enrolled with the written instruction of the NDPP
