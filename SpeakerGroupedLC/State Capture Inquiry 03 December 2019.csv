Clarence Mentor,Echo Its up to Who? Everything ultimately turns out white in the washing. Nothing.😁😁😁 Fruitless and Wasteful. Not within the ambit of the AG. Our Judge is already a celebrity.

fundile jali,this is a fruitless expenditure
Pastor J.J,@fundile jali ...What is?...The hearing or the Data you are using to watch it? The sound is 100% perfect on my side. Check your device perhaps @Zamekile Desemela Ready and waiting my brother@Elvis Malakoane @anya van loggerenberg ...Please enlighten us all. What is the basis for your views that this is a smokescreen.? @Elvis Malakoane ....That is so true The NPA has already said as a fact that they have prepared charge sheets with evidence coming from this Commission. Lets give it a chance @anya van loggerenberg @Phillip Cwazibe They have said that and committed to that already. Adv Hermine Cronje has been appointed totall for that task. @Mshika Mshika ...Yes you are right. I also understand peoples frustrations particularly when corruption was evident and no action during those dreaded 9years@anya van loggerenberg She has already implicated Jimmyboy Manyi in Perjury and lying under oath. @Mshika Mshika ...That is a brilliant assessment of the status quo of the situation. Well said @LED BULPS ...Lie Detector tests are done on a voluntary basis only and cannot be imposed otherwise. Also it is not seen as evidential material in a Court process. @LED BULPS ...Evidence from Affidavits only must be lead by additional evidence being led and subjected to scrutiny. Otherwise it is useless like Zuma saying I will send an affidavit but not be questi questioned about it under cross examination. @LED BULPS ...Mostly yes...but implicated parties may be forced to do so via a Subpoena if they dont do so voluntarily @LED BULPS ....Because it has never ever been certified to be 100% reliable anywhere in the world. @LED BULPS ...Even speed cameras have been successfully interrogated in court and cases where won. It is what it is unfortunately @LED BULPS And so say all of us @Marcus Levack I feel that this Aunty is not telling the truth. She needs to tell us that she was asked by the Gupta's and Zuma to appoint him after he was dismissed and she was appointed a Minister. "Gupta This Aunty is lying and that is the end of my story on her. @Elvis Malakoane Lying and passing the buck it seems. "@Rob Nel ...The answer to your question lies with the Gupta's "I thingyou meant ""Cadre"" @Sthakathi Khumalo . Cadets are in the Navy" think you @Sthakathi Khumalo @Sthakathi Khumalo ...You are forgiven...hahahahaha @Bianca Arnold But I was also told a long time ago to plant a few feathers and.........are you telling me my dearly departed and much loved and sometimes annoying granny was lying.hahahaha @Brendan Rampath ...Welcome back .@Eliot Chauke ...I always liked ypou and I still do but tell me why you say that @Eliot Chauke ...No more nonsense today ok baba? we still want to love you @Person of interest ...It takes special effort with some of these okes. But I only know love. @Person of interest ...Go for it. I will pray for forgiveness afterwards....hehehehehe "Malema "Someone here yesterday suggested we ""leave Old Man Zuma alone"". I suggested Solitary confinement.Anybody agrees with me?" We will make him suffer @Lorraine Naidoo . You have any hot chillies in the garden? That china chillies? @Lorraine Naidoo Thats the one @Lorraine Naidoo John2:11 What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. "@Elvis Malakoane .. There is a deep message in her quoting those scriptures. She seems to intimate ""if only I knew better then""" @Danie Nilsen That is sickening. Like any other killing. But some strange things are happening in that environment. I am being diplomatic or a backlash will come quickly @Danie Nilsen ... I have been told that a lot lot worse happening in that environment but this is being highlighted because of the people involved. Makes sense? "Your problem might be the same as mine Danie. Not the muti but the wife screaming ""hey you""" @Danie Nilsen They say that India costs less than 10% of what we pay here in SA. Quote the Gupta name and payin cash and you get another 2.5% off "He said ""Party Cooler"" @LED BULPS" Chaps. Maybe he bought the False Teeth on his Edgars account and didnt pay all the instalments and they took back the 1 tooth "@Re Al Maybr because of that saying ""lying through your teeth"" Please pardon our humor"
Mimmy Maruta Chintakoma,kuoa volume
makhosi nobhatyi,Journalists Tlabi 😱😱😳😳😳 Zuma will fall she is investigating a lot Zuma @ Vuyo hlahla Zuma never responds to any allegation instead tell us about spy and conspiracy to kill him My beautiful lady "Nehawu is corrupt Uyaxoka lo mama how can you not search what was charged for? How did you withdraw those charges? These appointees of ministers compromised their decision to suit state capture He gets his share
vuyo hlahla,"Zuma has left with with few hiding places 
Zamekile Desemela,The sound is terrible
Mshika Mshika,"SABC Please sort out the sound @Mbuso Ndlovu how so? @Gladys Nombewu i agree with you "@African Refuge i hear you "@Pastor J Most people here comment based on their emotions not facts "@Pastor J people must also note that we a dealing with a network of criminals not individuals
Granny Mokwena,my favorite advocate is back👌
Thulani Bukani,Hofmeyer 💃🕺🏿 we should invite the states legal services to the commission. because everyone seems to get bad/state capture enabling advice from the state's legal team

No on retirement what is lucky about being not white? person of interest Ohk I see I am doing that I wonder what do those verses say pastor j OK thanks its interesting given context of all things around LED BULPS after this verse now you evidence? pastor j yes that what i thought I hear you He is talkative He is also is a John 29 Member He is drunk in terms of John 29 Baloyi takes Nyaope Bianca Arnold you are right Bianca and big gaps

Zukile Mawisa,"They start by mixing up dates when they are going to lie and then change languages I think not. There you go. First lie. They never recall anything. This is a commission of Amnesiacs. They can't remember anything except when they getting paid "I don't even want to hold my breath
Pheladi Lamola,Is she still a minister? "I'm having a problem with people who keep coming on here "It makes no sense for them to come here and lie. Obviously these advocates follow-up on everything. And Ms Hoffmeyer is busy repeating the question of the letter She sounds like Baleka. Yes @Sam Monkoe. He banna😂😂 Is there John 29 in the bible? 😂😂😂

Re Al,Morning people "so in a ""he said I wonder how much has been spent on corruption:/ The money spent on this commission could be recovered by the successful prosecution and attachment of assets of 1 corrupt official. So lets not get hung up by such small things "joh these people never take accountability. its always :"" Legal services told me @Bianca Arnold I agree. Or they know their job very well and intentionally broke procedure. Now they claiming incompetence in order to escape liability. @Eliot Chauke LoL @Mphedululo Mudau lol you only realising that now 🤣🤣 "@Mphedululo Mudau Yea I doubt any of us knew the extent of corruption. We all kmew that there was corruption LoL why we focusing on his teeth instead of his evidence LoL yea but its still uncalled for LoL @Pastor J not excused
anya van loggerenberg,morning peeps... gosh this is going to be a long day🙄 can someone please remind me why we are having this commission again??? nothing will come from this!!! @Kabelo Katjedi agree they will go scot free "@Robert Russell yes i know thats what we hope for but will it really happen @Pastor J believing that something is being done but no one will do anything to bring criminals too book @Pastor J i know we have to be patient but our patience is running low we need to see some action!!! this process is going too slow @Robert Russell she is amazing a breath of fresh air @Elvis Malakoane i hope you are right but yes we have to stay positive difficult as it seems
Kabelo Katjedi,"This people should just b treated like criminals Van Loggerenberg just to fool us stupid voters nt to remove them coming election.Nothing will happen to those criminals "This people r given weeks to prepare their lies before appearing in commission "Mbuso thats how it is 
Sandile Ndlovu,even this enquiry is used to steal money of this country yes very true all these politicians must be arrested period enquiry of justified stealing as we speak more than R40 000 000 on the enquiry I am not sure on corruption

Mandla58,Morning You are absolutely right people are so negative
The Real SamQ,I wonder how much has been spent on this enquiry?
Mario Johnson,mornig they stole everything didnt even leave coim coins
Phillip Cwazibe,"@Bianca Arnold He said that he was dismissed @ Pastor J ​ The NPA will pursue charges. @ Bianca Arnold he said he discussed with Ms Oliphant the removal of another minister. Another lie @ Robert Russell ​ Advocate Kate Hoffmeyer is always clear and follows all her arguments/questions in a logical manner. Pastor J ​ She has already implicated Jimmyboy Manyi 5 times by now. @ Elvis Malakoane ​I Indeed Ms Oliphant is not a lier. Mr Manyi is already under the bus and sort of direct to the back wheels. "If a hearing is pending an investigation
