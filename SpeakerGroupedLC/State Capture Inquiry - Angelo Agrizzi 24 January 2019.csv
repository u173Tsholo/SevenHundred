Therefore No-one is clean@ Matome "I'm tired of voting poverty and humiliation when you apply for a job We are bitter within the ANC @Johan Strauss eff IS READY @Admire Zulu The EFF is already giving the ANC a run for their money. Just watch after the elections. EFF=A LOT OF SENSE TO ME. No-one can prove the EFF is implicated anywhere. FACTS PLEASE. "@Liam Decker Ramaphosa is benefitting from the Chinese projects "@Liam Decker We acknowledge and those problems must be addressed. Remember if the EFF betrays us I think discussing Ethnicity is irrelevant here. We have a a common problem here. We are all ripped off by corrupt ANC. No ethnic intolerance please. That's divide and rule weapon of the oppressor. @Khalid Mather Thank you Khalid. @The Truth We can win against corruption which is the common cause that we face if we divert. @Yose Human When are you going to learn that Ramaphosa himself is corrupted? That's why he lied about his son's contract in Parliament. All the corruption happened under President Ram's watch. He is not clean.Let's clean our country first the rest will follow. Our people are poverty stricken. It's getting worse @Yose Human @King Vuka I agree. @Sebenzile Kenny Mabohlo ETHNICITY took us nowhere in the 90's instead we killed each other while the enemy stood aloft and watched. @Sebenzile Kenny Mabohlo You are so right.

Nico L,"There's no one to vote for "Zulus I'm afraid we need to vote DA and then come down on them like thunder when they don't deliver.. The lesser evil we have at this moment. The only way to fix the ANC is to vote DA. Voting EFF is purely an emotional overeaction and that is suicide. EFF will deal with racism? They are massive racists. Or can black people not be racist? "DA should not rule I totally agree but they should keep the ANC on their toes. So they need to get enough votes. EFF will bring only hatred Their manifesto is very different from their agenda I'm afraid. Have anyone every heard Malema say that South Arica belongs to all South Aricans irrespective of their race? I don't think he can say it even if he tried very hard. I know a liar when I see one. Malema is one of those. "Don't worry Thando "Relax people. Go ahead and vote ANC "The DA has no vision I'm afraid the DA are too far away from reality in this country. Steenhuisen and co. I will vote DA because I love this country. It's the only way to force the ANC to clear out the criminals with minimal risk. Thando you're just trolling dude. People here shouldn't give you the pleasure. Zim is fine? LOL "A lot of the senior people in DA are out of touch with the majority of SA. I'm white "Thando Ah man what I would give for a Nando's burger right now.. "Maybe he got a bribe from Nando's to give them exposude Right on Makho They're too boring "Are there any white people left in the ANC
