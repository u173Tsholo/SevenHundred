The Vuka Experience,Hi Lady Hi Lady Zondo swallowed Kwesta 🥰 "Agrizzi has opened the floor @Yandi Masina 🤧 Byeee @Yandi Masina 😂 @Yose Human tribalism. 🤦🏾‍♂️👎🏾 @Yose Human don’t try and divide us. @Yose Human is trying that divide and conquer strategy his forefathers used. "PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT. Let’s ignore @Yose Human. He is an agent to make us blacks fight amongst each other. Unyile it’s not gonna happen. We love Zulu "Agrizzi opened the floor for racists to come out @Yandi Masina they are the ones racist here right now! We also don’t wield institutional power. @Moira T I’ve got a pair enough to call racists out. You haven’t condemned any racists here! "@Yandi Masina there is a difference between prejudice and racism. One needs institutional power and the other doesn’t. If we will say blacks are racist for this Racism goes beyond not liking someone because of the colour of their skin. colonisers hated our skin and hated our existence and wielded institutional power to oppress us. Who are we oppressing? @Derek Main and yet 90% of the economy (wealth) and 73% of the land is in the hands of white people. The right to vote is not freedom. Wake up black child! @Yandi Masina I hear you and love you my sister. It’s even scary that white people here aren’t calling out their own for being racist and yet engage me for pointing out their racism. Wake up black child. We are not yet UHURU @Derek Main I agree there is also a class issue but let’s not ignore racism too. @Derek Main I agree but my point was on the racism here RIGHT NOW. Let’s not scapegoat what @Yose Human and all his racist friends are subjecting is to and chance classism Ok I’m out. We are not yet Uhuru. ✊🏾 @Derek Main thank you. @Xola X The Xilaman just block “it” that thing isn’t a human. "Just block Yose guys This guy is lukewarm "@Yandi Masina and @G Mann. This is one of those conversations that would be fruitful in person. We can’t limit racism to skin colour "There is a difference between racism and prejudice. Black people can be prejudice but we need institutional power to be racist. Racism is not limited to skin colour @Neo Mongale I tell you we need to wake up. White peoples have no right to tell us what is and what is not racist. You lost that right in 1884 at the Berlin Conference. "Before I go. Black child we are not yet Uhuru and until we emancipate our selves from whiteness we will remain in bondage. The rainbow nation worked to prevent a civil war @Derek Main I didn’t say “call out” I said “tell us” which means define. Yes please call out but don’t impose its definition on us. There has never been a system to oppress whites for them to know. @Derek Main the only thing we got lost 1994 was the right to vote. White people lost nothing. Even at CODESA whites lost nothing. This commission proves whites run the economy "@Derek Main if that’s what racism is then you are downplaying what colonists did because they didn’t just hate our skin colour "@Derek Main "@Derek Main that was hate speech and I don’t agree with it. It’s also prejudice "@Jake Ellis @maliez who is giving the money is the most important questions. You are corrupt when you’re enable. @Jake Eliis cause they are all corrupt bro. That’s clear! ALL of them are. I never said anything to the contrary @Maliez yes! Now we are balanced. I’ll vote but still undecided as to who! @Jake Ellis my brother that was never a point of contention. I was speaking to racism on the comments. Ok I’m out. @Maliez cheers family @Jake Ellis we are together on that one. @Yandi Masina your DP 🔥🔥🙌🏾 @Yandi Masina haha still 🔥🔥🔥😂
G Mann,Zondo for president "Tribalism "@Yandi Masina whispers from the gallery @Yandi Masina freedom has consequences. Sometimes you have to be careful what you wish for 😃 @sibusiso madondo tribal wars existed long before racism and will be a big problem in the years ahead. "@Yose Human back to school for you some please explain the nature of SA tribalism to @Yose Human @Mpho Mashigo everyone and everyone in SA is racist except black people right? @Yandi Masina so you are saying that black people are not racist yes? @Yandi Masina serias? Impossible that black people can be racist. "@makhosi nobhatyi kill the farmer kill the boer

People need to get angry 😤 Don’t drop the soap
Yandi Masina,👀 @King Vuka ☕ @Innocent Madamala Say what???😂😂😂 😃😃😃 @Lunga Dlamini Better than yesterday. He seems more relaxed. Black people actually.

"@King Vuka As blacks @G Mann To Freedom 🗣🗣✊ @King Vuka Be fair. Read all the comments from the top. @Innocent Madamalala True that. @King Vuka I get that. I just don't want us to act as if we're clean. "@CUMA NTANGANA Oh @Dumisani And they always stick together. @sipho cebo Click on their name. @Simon Warne You and me both. "The same thing Agrizzi said with regards to Jumbo Liquors. They transfer money "@robin ronne No trace @G Mann That is exactly what I was trying to clear up with @King Vuka earlier. "@G Mann No Year 2000👀 @King Vuka That's my boo Nicki😃 Bosasa was paying everyone's bill except mine 😣 *s 12:12 Oh Pistorius can laugh now? Yet he wasn't when Agrizzi was there.

Musa Bakiti,Afrikaaner scared not like Italian mafia Zuma said Africa's problems started when Afrikaaners came in our land Zuma is like Jesus of South Africa rejected by his own people Afrikaaners will write the bible of Zuma after his departure on the face of earth. Please Mr Van Tonder speak Afrikaans "😢 i miss Agrizzi already  In Capitalist state everything is for sell. EFF last hope for Africa Mr Van Tonder i need 100 chickens😂😂😂 From which bank did all this cash came from and what did the bank do about it? EFF EFF EFF Bring Agrizzi's wife women empowerment .She knows more than Agrizzi How do you kill racism? Simple VOTE for EFF With your EFF vote you will get respected and empowered True empowerment. I thought white people cannot be corrupt.EFF thank you for pushing the idea of this commission. I thought white people cannot be corrupt.EFF thank you for pushing the idea of this commission "@Jake  Afrikaans destroyed this country it needs a strong minded leader like Juju and Loyd under the flag of EFF. This coming December if all white can go back to home land .South Africa can the best December I thought white people cannot be corrupt.EFF thank you for pushing the idea of this commission Gavin is great man .i like him . @Derek Main i only got 1 tone 🐓 @Derek Main my sangoma protected me no white man can mention my name Gavin Watson is clever guy .running a company and signing no document wooo! This guy we need a movie @Phumlani Mhlongo in the world there is no wrong and right only winners and losers.Watson is the Winner and Agrizzi and Tonder are losers Zuma is still leader of ANC and CR is just a window dresser. When my son grow up i want him to be like Gavin Watson. Gavin give 2 tone of chicken i won't speak for 5 years😷😷
Hein de Wit,Money Laundering at its worst @Musa Bakiti May I enquire which Afrikaaners Zuma was refering too? Moira T 😃
Colyn and Roslyn James,DCJ Zondo is totally in tune and highly effective in questioning...
jeevan singh,Black is beautiful. White is Wonderful. Brown is both😀😀😀😀 jenelle. Need some light hearted remarks here. 😃👍 I tired of this racism. I agree with Cuma. this must stop Cuma. please tell these guys to stop all this raicist talks. Cuma. are you still here. please stop these guys. it's very irritating. yes EFF people please get out of here. you guys are sick with your racial issues. a blind man said. the worst thing about having eyesight is having no vision. you gus fit the profile. another blind man said. your eyes is GOD'S GIFT only when you know to use them. we are one people. So take a q and stop your nonsense about black white brown etc. etc. or go home. Cuma👍 yes. SASSA is the poor peoples social card. BOSASA is the politians social card. 😀😀 Ntshabisen you like it hey. I heard that Agrizzi put his house up for sale sold all his furniture and is planning to run to Italy. is this true. thanks Anthony Thanks. yeah I'm a bit behind. Geeg. Just realized him going to Italy is going into Marfia territory. hooo. He's going to be put away there. Watson will see this as an opportunity. guaranteed he's not coming back. Big mistake here. Chester don't you get it SASSA social card is for the poor people. BOSASA social card is for the politicians. Cuma👍 Cuma. hooo. half of our population will be dead. The main cause of racism is the ability to see. GOD'S gift being misused. Cuma. imagine if we all were born blind. No racism. ONE HUMAN RACE. is correct. Neo Imagine this. My Grandfather is Black and my Grandmother mother is White. my father is Indian. And I look an Indian. speak like an Indian. no trace of Black or white in appearance. then Imagine if we were all blind. Our parliament will be full of Neo. it's not an anology. it's me Neo. are you EFF.. Granny👍 These guys are talking like they are political gurus. it's a joke. These guys were stealing millions and millions of our tax money made our Black people poorer and poorer. I don't feel sorry for them. everyone of them including the corrupt must go to jail. Corrupt politicians must go to jail. Imagine Patrick Gillingham works department of correctional affairs going to jail. yeo. one of Bosasa guy ran away to USA. Agrizzi is going on holiday to Italy. Marfia territory. won't come back. will be put away there. Watson will see this. Phumlani. no guarantee. then we done. going with his family. EXTRADITION TREATY WITH USA. He struck a deal to testify. on condition he goes to Italy for a holiday. 9 black ethenic groups. then English and Afrikaans. masilakhe👍 Auditors Implicated. Being investigated right now by Audiotors association. Hollywood going to make a movie. Somebody got story rights from Agrizzi. it's happening. Robert Redford and John Kani will acting. Tata ma chance. Vota MA ANC. SA got a strong army. joke. DOES ANYBODY THINKS ZUMA WILL GO TO JAIL. There's 2 ANC. Zuma ANC and Cyril Ramaphosa ANC. It's true EFF is not corrupt. South Africa was rich. it got agrizzed. Rata. ya it was rich. it got agrizzed

Donald Geyer,Musa Bakiti......hahaha Musa Bakiti........🖕
M T,Dave East - Drop your English Name - It doesn’t suit your IQ! King Vuka - Wu Shemm - grow a real pair - even just for the duration of this floundering witness! Musa Bwah ha - You are a fool Peter Staffen 👍🏻 PreZactly! I am proud of my heritage - But some simply harp on with the same old same old. That card is so dead! Yose is brain dead Yose - and many don’t suffer fools! FIFO! SABC can’t pay salaries - I guess they don’t have a moderator 😉 "Yose go screw your palm Yose is more than likely Micheal du Toit 🤮🤗 Watch this space 🤔 Simone - He’s a lost troll! Yose - you’re an idiot "Robert “Too” ... I have my reasons 1 Million That was discussed previously 🤦🏼‍♀️ Tupelo 😬😝 So right - Their marketing is out of the top drawer! Waiting for cartoons too - gonna be classic! Ollielove 🤣 Toni John = Don’t be ashamed to use your birth name! Amazing how “Stock Control” was fiddled! G Mann - Correct! Chunky 👍🏻 Neo - and no food - how clever you are. Ask the Zimbabwean on this thread! LEARNMORE ... and then? LEARNMORE ... “Had” ... and then? Wilhelm & Derek I concur Yose - You are one sick puppy! Derek - he has just admitted “Whites run the economy” 🤣 Granny 👍🏻👏🏻 Lungi 👏🏻👍🏻 Ted 🤣🤣🤣 "Off Topic: His personality is dead from the ankles up 🤦🏼‍♀️ Imagine sitting in a room with him Yose only knows “C & V” and stuttering 🤦🏼‍♀️ "Myka - The quicker the rise Mzalwane Spot On - and neither will it belong to those the empty promises have been made - 25 years on. Mzalwane Spot On! Rayan - Corruption is the Capital Of SA Yose - You are a lost cause! Who pays your data? Nick ... Spot On! Ratan - don’t fall for the bias! "Myka - For once I agree! Probably the last time Yose - Narcissists “Expect”! Ratan - The inquiry? As jeevan has mentioned 👍🏻 Michael - Busy working on him! Hence my not “Shutting His Cake Hole Up”. Cassius - those “threads” are already frayed! Myka’Al Daud - You are pathetic! Ratan - SA was once a prosperous country - Going the same way as Zimbabwe 😭 Lyl Bali - Correct! Ratan - Only Army is Up the Sleevey - "Mzalwane - I for one won’t hold my breath Musa - That explains everything 🤮👿 A Leopard doesn’t change it’s spots - Greed dictates
Derek Main,@Musa Bakiti But Zuma's an a**hole @King Vuka So let's address those issues directly and not place the blame where it doesn't belong @King Vuka We have more of a class issue than a race issue @King Vuka What we need to address in gross inequality - whether it be blacks or whites who are guilty. Look at all the political elites - they are massively wealthy @King Vuka I agree - racism is a scourge that has to be eradicated. Us being divided along racial lines will not help to solve inequality - his just assists those who want to amass obscene wealth I blocked Yose a long time ago I'm happy not to see his racist bile @Richardt Human I doubt the avoidance is legal - business does not have any ethics @Rato Madise True - he seems like a sociopath @Khumbuzile Khumalo That's BS and you know it. There are plenty of black racists out there @Neo Mongale You do realise that that very statement is racist? @King Vuka I disagree - we all have the same right to call out racism "@Neo Mongale That might have been true before 1994 but it's not true now. By that argument @King Vuka Racism is discriminating on the basis of skin colour. It's long been defined and no longer needs defining "@King Vuka So tell me - when a black person says ""Kill all whites"" - that's not racist? Pull the other one" "@King Vuka Then why don't you rather say ""We hate anyone with feelings of superiority"" - why associate it with ALL whites?" "@Neo Mongale I'll concede that racism might have been ""invented"" by whites but that still doesn't mean blacks can't be racist." @Neo Mongale I put it to you that you are a racist dog like Michael du Toit and you don't even know it @Neo Mongale I do not consider all whites to be the same - only a racist would think like that @Luntu Hashe How so? "@Luntu Hashe That would be like me saying ""Zuma and his cabinet were corrupt - because he is black @Luntu Hashe OK - no problem @Siba Mfabe Exactly - spot on @Manfred Nkonki No way! @Manfred Nkonki I don't think SA could survive it @Given Nyathi Many other people had already exposed the ANC - the EFF just made that loudest noise @Phumlani Mhlongo And there is much to improve @Musa Bakiti Did you get a grey bag every month? @Musa Bakiti No wonder you like Gavin You must be worried you name will be mentioned @Doom Ruler In this case - yes. What's your point? @Musa Bakiti You seem to hero-worship criminals - you must be ANC
dave east,moira t the evidence just came out "South African paramilitary unit plotted to infect black population with Aids dumisani yes brother a report from one of those europeans has said this to be true "South Africa has the HIGHEST hiv aids stats but now we know why.South African paramilitary unit plotted to infect black population with Aids "a report just came out that South African paramilitary unit plotted to infect black population with Aids HIV aids is said to of have been spread by white groups. how do we deal with this info african people??? south africa has the HIGHEST aids stats and now its clear why yose human we need to move on now as a people. so what do we do that weve found out aids is being abd was spread from the 1960s

Mzalwane Mzala,@King Vuka Keep on teaching. Even Maimane and other black DA leaders like Van Damme and Nqaba agree that our differences are still race-based. Tho who disagree are more conservative Van Tonder will be the most damning witness in a court of law. He was a CFO and he is not flamboyant but boringly deal with facts. That sends criminals to jail even if it not viewed as sensational. @Myka'Al Daud Are you now married to a political party? "Bosasa claimed to be an organisation that had a Christian image. How do we I own a property that I want to keep as an investment and an inheritance for my children. Under an EFF government that property will belong to the state. I will note vote EFF @Sakhie Mawisa What am I missing? I will go to the EFF website and copy this verbatim. Others follow without understanding policies. @Sakhie Mawisa I am glad that you confirm that I am factually correct although you disagree with my reaction to that. WHAT IS THE EFF’s POSITION ON LAND EXPROPRIATION WITHOUT COMPENSATION? 37. The EFF wants a Constitutional amendment that would make it legally permissible for the State to expropriate land – but not other forms of property – without compensation. "38. This land must then be placed under the custodianship of the State "@psyfrequency Techno I have no responsibility of teaching you to read. This is direct from EFF website. I have not "39. The underlying principle is that land is a common natural endowment that everyone must be able to reside or produce on "What is to remain in private possession would be the manifestation of an individual’s labour Paragraph 39 of a document on the EFF website titled 'FAQs on land expropriation without compensation states that land will not a private possession. I can not vote for that. "39 '........What is to remain in private possession would be the manifestation of an individual’s labour 41. The EFF’s Founding Manifesto says: ‘The EFF’s approach to land expropriation without compensation is that all land should be transferred to the ownership and custodianship of the State' @Kaylen Reddy That is interesting @R R It is possible for the banks not to know as Agrizi say these guys are expects in hiding their acts @Phumlani Mhlongo I am with you Afrikaans is also a South African language Lindie Gouws "In a letter of resignation to DA leader Maimane The ANC is renewing The government is cleaning the NPA. A new NPA director will start on Friday Two senior NPA prosecutors who have been accused of corruption have been suspended The two NPA people who were also mentioned by Agriizi are fighting for their jobs in government initiated inquiry. It is a lie to say nothing is being done about cleaning the country
Dumisani Snr Mlotshwa,"Cebo - we listened to Agrizzi being a racist especially wouter basson spread aids Musa my brother whites respect one another . fully agree with you Humam. Yose you're lost brother. corruptor = corruptee Yose - this is a commission & not a court of law

M Peer,Are free shares to politically connected individuals not corruption. Most ANC NEC members accepted shares. Stop bickering and see the light. "All those free shares should have been put in a pot for the educational "Elected officials are there to oversee the stability "You are being distracted or diverted by the ""noise'." Stop the bickering and sometimes I think that the common voter is the cause of all the problems. "Can you give a written guarantee that JUju or Cyril or Musi will solve our problems.Get up  Focus on the now and the future. Stop bickering and following demagogues who will disappoint you.No politician is worth fighting for. Look at lifestyles Will Cyril give back all the shares he owns and all the money he has earned as non exec director to the fiscus All you guys fighting over your politicians.All you guys are fifg You will be left behind. You will be where you are It is the nature of politicians to mislead and lie.. Stop bickering and hold them accountable. Democracy is not perfect.Even the uninformed and criminals have the vote. Cyril and Juju are not saviours. If you believe that you should reconsider. Corruption is truly non racial. All you guys been suckered whether by Zuma <malema or Cyril. "Stop the hero worship This is not the ANC that liberated SA. I was there in 1994 and at the inauguration of Mandela. This is a different ANC.It is predatory Well even the Cubans contributed to the liberation apartheid Stop the loyalty to politicians and their parties.i Be loyal to your country. lyl bali stop your racism rattan go google and read for youself Sa is not important on the global stage Corruption has no race or gender. it is truly non racial so stp the racist comments you are distracted talent you are wasting your comment.
