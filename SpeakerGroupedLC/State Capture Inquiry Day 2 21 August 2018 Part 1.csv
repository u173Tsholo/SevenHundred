Pauline Marunga,hie
Gomo Miya,we are ready ....sir SABC. Live stream This is going to be a very interesting Commission of inquiry im even thinking of taking leave Ntate Mathebula o re jesa course (PROCUREMENT 101) there's definitely no monitoring in government Controls are there...but the problem is the implementation... very important..... Contract management same here....@sindiswamoolman very insightful capacitate all SCM Practioners ***practitioners within government and do away with consultants Thanks for the lecture Mr OCPO...I now have a broader understanding of Supply chain management
Nduduzo Zondi,where is the live stream TRC failed us....Marikana Commission yielded no results....Several Motions Of no Confidence failed...can this state capture commission be trusted...or it's simply meant to create public impression.... ….is South African political landscape a living testimony of Marx about state being a tool of economic and ruling class who use it to exploit the masses... can south Africa trust and rely on a commission appointed under the leadership of a candidate who was a deputy of the former president who is the core of this commission...
Zibele Dyonaae,Lasuka lahlala
Orbert Mulaudzi,Operation clean up is starting today
Thiza William,You can run but cannot hide. Wise people warned the world that what you do in the dark always come into the open what's wrong about being standard bank employee...don't you have an account with Monopoly Capital bank or as a real black patriot uses VBS bank Stop insulting a Blackman intelligence by defending an indefensible criminal act "Start going to a genuine business and work honestly and diligently "@ Peter Pot what's difficult to invest more of your energy Blackman work hard to reach for greatness draw inspirations to people like Maponya who worked for nearly 60 years to be where he is today. learn from Patrick Motsepe who used black opportunities in existence to expand his empire same as Ramaphosa @ Stanley are characters like yourself that uses entitlement mentality to undermine the cause of a Blackman. You're your worse enemy "@ Peter Pot Zuma made Guptas very wealthy as well. Besides his family can you remember any black person. note he promised to create 100 black industrialist in 2013 "@ Nosiphiwe we fought for this country and sacrifice our youth to be where we're. it's so insulting to listen to a peace time hero @ Peter Pot change the nation's thinking mentality and create an entrepreneurial strata which will lead the developmental state that promulgation of legislation after legislation to enrich the nation. Learn from the successful nations than thinking that South Africa is a special case. @ Peter Pot what's wrong since his not implying anything but giving standard procedures as define through legislation....to me nothing in a conflict of interest which the judge and his best legal team stupid or less aware than you the case of Nombebe was cleared by all in legal fraternity to be no compromise at all. he benefited nothing as an individual and when the matter of Trillian was exposed the money was returned back there can be no compromise regarding corruption Corruption is a cancer: a cancer that eats away at a citizen's faith in democracy There can be no compromise regarding corruption the accomplice to the crime of corruption is frequently our own indifference "corruption is worse than prostitution. The latter might endanger the morals of an individual

Stanley Gumza,Who knows I don't think so. Very true... "How can we be clean I don't think so.. it's a shame think about the percentagr share of black people out of 800b annually...

Chris Welensky,This inquiry will cost more than the money recovered. @Thiza William our worst problem is we have a Zombie nations which translates into entitlement.

Kisten Moonsamy,South Africa is blessed with some honest and incorruptible African leaders. Let the truth be the dividing force that separates the corrupt and the incorruptible. Masses of our people are suffering because of some greedy politicians and their cohorts. Cleansing process has the begin in the ruling party. Laws of sowing and reaping will always follow those evil and greedy people who deliberately steal from the poor. Gupta has stolen from the poor. They will pay back .

Akhumzi Buthelezi,1. Arms deal inquiry - Millions spent - Zero politicians convicted 3. Life Esidimeni Arbitration - Millions spent- Zero Politician convicted 4. Eskom Inquiry - Millions spent - Zero Politicians convicted "5. State capture Inquiry - Millions of tax payers are about to be spent - and no Politician will be convicted. Wake up South Africa "Some of the advocates under Judge Zondo benefited from Trillian Capital "Commissions of inquiries just like the Apartheid TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Commission) are mechanisms used by the Government of the day to ""cool"" down the public and regain confidence in the state" 1. Arms deal inquiry 2. Marikana Inquiry 3. Life Esidimeni arbitrations 4. Eskom inquiry How many convictions did the above yield? can we not entertain racists in this comment section @peter pott i agree I love South Africa and i believe in our Unity in diversity "Black "@Robert Russell You must understand that politics and politicians objectives is to divide us so that they can rule over us Tea adjournment @Sybil Stephens say that again "why i hate Politics: they divide The Governement is there to fill their own pockets while promising to solve your problems "ANC 90% of South Africans are NOT Woke That is why they dont want to improve the Education system If they improve the education system they wake you up "Only in SA we have a Masters graduate without a skill @graeme armstong exactly My fellow South Africans we need to wake up to the System This System is Evil "@Sybil Stephens Unite @Leon Mabiza Who funds the EFF? do you know whats their Agenda? @Sybil Stephens Lead us where? to extreme CAPITALISM? "EFF is funded by Mazzotti "DA is funded by Israel ANC is funded by the Guptas and Tax payers money "I am trying to show you that no political party has you interests at heart @graeme armstong which system is better communism or capitalism? "@Leon Mabiza you have been successfully fooled @Blak N Eazzy you nailed it!!! Only in AFRICA that Liberation parties lead by Black Leaders dont emancipate their people but act as stooges on White Capital to oppress their own what is closure? if Zuma doesnt go to jail theres no closure for me "Zuma took money for pit toilets and gave to one family "ANC will never investigates WMC WMC is the top 5% that holds 95% of the contrys wealth
Mzalwane Mzala,@MIKE LOCK You are confusing this South Africa with apartheid that banned certain organisations. Communism and communists is allowed in South Africa. We ban no political thinking @peter pott Which advocate is that and what would be the problem Are you going to employ them @thando cezula @thando cezula The reason for the removal of that station is not state capture. State capture is still being dealt with in this commission Please point to a decision of a court or commision on state capture or looting that led to the fall of that station @thando cezula DA never loved black people @thando cezula Are you done with pointing out looting in proping up the station? @thando cezula I am still waiting for a court or commission judgement. Please give me one. @thando cezula Is that a court or a commission rulling? @thando cezula You are happy that black people have lost their jobs and you can't prove looting @thando cezula I hate looting and love black people What crime was found @thando cezula Please @thando cezula quickly check the reason for the license not to renewed and you will find that it has nothing to do with looting @thando cezula I am glad that you have come to understand that there is no link between looting and the closure of the station. I want the Guptas to o to jail but we must not lie. Mathebula is educating us.
Edgar Masilo,all who are held responsible must jst face the music finix and klaar
luckymahasha,I trust that this inquiry will help us to find closure
Philani ngcobo,"I am expecting people like opposition parties
thando cezula,smokescreen for what? Which advocates Akhumzi? Those jobs were created through the looting of state funds so they were never really jobs in the first place "Those ""employees"" benefited from gross looting by the Guptas" Then you're very ignorant Mzwanele "But whatever reason I'm just glad it's gone!!! It benefitted from state capture. The money used to start that station was money looted from state coffers! The New Age was also part of the machinery of state capture No need for a commission! It's closed qha qwaba and that's all that matters! The banks didn't need a commission or court judgement to close down the accounts of the Gupta-owned companies but they closed them down anyway I'm happy that we're taking back our country from thieves and looters who're robbing us blind off our hard earned monies A few jobs will have to be sacrificed in the pursuit of regaining our rule of law and order! Mzwanele those jobs were never supposed to be in existence in the first place! Mzwanele you don't believe looting took place? Khona what crime was going to be found when the chief looter Jacob Zuma had rendered the Hawks and NPA toothless... I understand it has nothing to do with looting! But we all know Multichoice couldn't carry on with a company with so much mud on them And I really don't care what the reason is as long as that Gupta channel has been closed down! ANN7 protected thieves and vilified those who were trying to do right by this country! Their propaganda was so obvious though! ANN7 would have a panel of 5 people all speaking one language without a single dissenting view My stolen money! "On behalf of all hard working South Africans
Victor Mkhaliphi,Just joined the inquiry. How's this witness testimony so far??????

poloko collen,black men are once again showing that they can not run their country effectively...really sad. Men not women in Africa have tried to run countries but most id not all like in SA were corrupt and dishonest overlords nor leaders. people might say its not about race but the whole world is looking at how black people run SA compared to whites and come to their conclusions.
Annie Robb,please @Fils de l'homme give it a break! all humans are susceptible to corruption we really need to understand how did this happen????
Mahlasela Kilson,no more race cards to protect the thieves in the government arts and education can play a better role to grow south africa better than the greed politicians who only push their agends not for the people they preach to love them while they need the votes @Sybil Stephens i agree with you on that most of the youth are doomed by politics they no longer care about reality of their are lifes daily @Sybil Stephens is not gonna be easy to woke them up because they buy them with the money to brainwash their minds @Leon Mabiza it looks like you are one of the corupt why you work for public office but you need it to be private what i want ot say is the government does not have to have anything to hide as they are working for the public It looks like ANC only teach the comrades only to loot not train them on how to serve the people who vote for them. Because they dont hold them acountable when they are looting the state money @hemant morarjee because they hold acountable for those who still from the state @hemant morarjee what is the different
Robert Russell,@Akhumzi Buthelezi .... go tell that to Juju and his merry mad men of the EFF
Victor,kkkkk you sit around if you dont have money for tea
Sybil Stephens,And yet you are fast asleep. "Most South Africans are fast asleep Only attorneys win in this case. Look at the world around you. Everything is falling apart. "How can anyone govern a people The only way to get SA on track is to use Lycurgus style of governing. (Spartan king) True "they eat and drink and make merry "Education has always been freely available. Libraries are empty People should use the libraries more. "mostly their brains are nummed by chasing dreams "yes true The greatest evil is IGNORANCE How can we turn things around? How can we wake people up? "I tried for years "I tried with philosophy "But I believe that Cyril Ramaphosa is the one who will lead us They want to be called coloureds. They are my family. hope not He just seems intelligent and sincere "So why do they cling to that classification

We're lucky to have the Julius Malema his gonna save us from this ANC fiasco @Akhumzi Buthelezi The EFF is funded by the masses. @graeme armstong - EFF is capable @Akhumzi Buthelezi Funded or one time donation? No people. We can't be debating that in 2018. DA is the worst "DA is funded by Absa and the likes of the big corporates @graeme armstong hahahah you make me laugh! EFF is serious about helping black people. Land expropriation and SARB nationalisation @Peter Staffen You should read more but from the trash media. "@Akhumzi Buthelezi - I want to be fooled more. I like the EFF policies The DA is the biggest threat of black empowerment. Look a the BBEEE saga now. There's more coming to continue oppressing the black. What happened to the Eskom inquiry? State capture is an attack on blacks. Why is ABSA not investigated for apartheid money? Mckinseys involvements. Zuma only ate 20% of the pie. WMC controls 80% and they loot out country everyday through tax evasions. Everybody knows that. Exactly! It not about race but what we do in Government must be done in private Those UJ counselors who ate student's money. When is being questioned? Steinhoff? Wake up people!
