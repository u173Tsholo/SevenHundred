michael mbatha,"@Sthakathi Khumalo - I noticed something similar with Adv. Pretorius when he was leading Mr Agrizzi "Work experience played a big role. Look at the expert yesterday "Nobhatyi - An overwhelming majority of South Africa is not very educated. Census 2011 found that less than one-third of SA has matric. So mostly This mine was being sabotaged deliberately inorder to give in to being taken over by the Gupta Tegeta mine.

I RATHER VOTE FOR TRANSVAAL WHAT WHAT "@Michael Michael There are naturally more black people in South Africa So you guys don’t trust white (DA) people 17 years after the end of apartheid. @Michael Michael and @carnoth ngomane i hear you guys but @carnoth ngomane We still have white bosses in our places of employment. Some are better than others. Others are caring and genuinely want to see black progress Don't kill me guys but it think the real reason most black people won’t vote for the DA is because they want to fix their problems for themselves. lol. bye guys.... @Fils de l'homme i need to smoke weed now. before i burst a vessel in my brain with all this topics @Fils de l'homme the transvaal thing? 😂😂😂😂😂 @Jean-Pierre Le Roux you are worse than a black man @Thando Nkutha why do you want fils blocked? @Jean-Pierre Le Roux i wish i was. trust me i would have... never mind you not worth my typing we are called racist for stating points @ Jean call me a racist again and i will show u Mma wakho "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux I don’t believe in plastic surgery @Jean-Pierre Le Roux Tell me… Is being stupid a profession or are you just gifted?People like you are the reason we have middle fingers. @Jean-Pierre Le Roux Why Don’t You Slip Into Something More Comfortable.

Born free,wait till they get to Phembani Shanduka was a mining business that Ramaphosa had shares in he sold some of these shares when he became President as this would be a conflict of interest. Phembani is another company. I wouldn't say Ramaphosa is out of the woods just yet. This commission could reveal many things.

Finding solutions should be number 1 on the agenda rather than blaming Playing the blame game will not change the future but only remind everyone of the bitter past I want safe streets kids can play everywhere in south africa. Running water and electricity should be available to every household No one should live on the street Everyone should have a roof over their head Zuma left a difficult task for Ramaphosa. I doubt the president can just fire people left and right. That would compromise his position as president Het needs to be smart and be ahead of his enemies Rasisct trolls cause division in our country @Jean-Pierre Le Roux I agree @Yose Human why u copy me xD
