"@Thando he mentioned his few qualifications in the beginning yep He also mentioned some other studies with certification and others without certification... hard working brother Currently he is Chief Executive & Executive Director of SBSA...

Bibby AGOUTANGNI,The ANC is full of people like Fuzile. Just that the system keep them at the backgroung and put some half baked people at the front "All is not doomed with SA. When we look at people like Mr Fuzile
Nelson Musoliwa,So far Mr Fuzile is the type of servants SA needs Unfortunately Thando zuma was and is not competent in this type of matter he is just best in singing to whip gullible people emotion to blindly support him @Thando it actually disgusts me to use freedom songs for sinister purpose No Thando we are many but others are unable to express their view because of fear or lack of resources
Singi Mathebula,agree with you Bibby from Monday we will do things in accordance with the law. that was power Fuzile. is there anyone of us who still take malema serious 😘 I am talking about black monopoly capital not me.

Tumi Molale,any suggestions for a party to vote TN must b joking scary suggestion even scarier than TN's suggestion my problem TN DA is governing thanks to EFF in 2 metros will never vote for DA and will never support anybody in bed with DA.
dawie botha,"deputy pres. promise them a house with a bed and stove if you do that you are brainless vote eff and loot another bank and your comrades are stealing your goats
Syanda Ntozini,I’m voting DA coz the best ran municipalities in SA are all DA ran. @Thando tell me of one country that was a democratic country and is now back to the olden days of oppression because of new leadership? "Mayor Herman Mashaba revealed affordable housing for the people of Gauteng yesterday "So @Thando @Thando EFF is led by greedy people who want to rule and continue where the ANC left of mxm It’s sad but that’s what’s happening now @Leon Another thing...I would not want my son to behave like the EFF does in Parliament. They resort to noise and violent if better points are raised against them mxm. Lol Thando go ahead do that. I don’t get why for me 2 be black means I should associate with the hooliganism of the EFF? No @Thando I want my child to know that u don’t respect someone coz of their skin color but coz they deserve and have earned that respect What does color have to do with well ran municipalities @Thando? EFF is the most racist party I’ve seen so far. "Typical EFF "Tumi’ if u stay in PTA "Just like in 2019 the party for all people will rule @Thando u can go shove that membership where the sun doesn’t shine 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 "@ANC was better under Mandela and Mbeki @Mazibuko had to go study at Oxford. De Lile and DA we’re not seeing eye to eye she decided to leave. It saddens me that the EFF is led by people who are educated and intelligent but act barbaric in Parliament. I feel sorry for my fellow brothers who see nothing wrong with their behavior 😒😒 "@Shai He was addressing the speaker of parliament mos 😂😂
