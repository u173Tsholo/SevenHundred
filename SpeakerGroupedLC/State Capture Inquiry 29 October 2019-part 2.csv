Friday yes @sthakathi khumalo i like maleka too. only reason I like Hofmeyer more is she has a way with the DCJ
Yolo More,"Thulani Bukani no Ijaji liyothusa vele. Uma ubhek'ijaji ucinga ngetrongo. Ukhangeleka ehlukumezekile yena. Amasela ayahlukumeza. Yona yiyo Thando Nkutha qha khandifune kunaba ngayo ngoba izobangathi siyamcukuceza ngoku singenangxaki qha sibeka izinto ngononina. Hahaha Hahahaha@ ngemva. "Thando Nkutha Ucingo lwehla mhla kwaphatha uZuma. Xa noHlaudi bezibona bengaphatha ngubani ongenophatha? Very smart. I admire people like Pretorius who do not waste our time and data on ducking. He is straightforward. I agree Tsotsi is coming later in the week. This week is rich. Yes Elvis. Thuli Madonsela will go down in history as one of the heroes who rescued us from the iron fist of the crooks. Ja your fave "When Hofmeyer agrees with you ""mm"" you must know you are in trouble." I dont trust men with bow ties. The old man looks nervous. What was your question Elvis Malakoane? I didnt see it. "The evidence leader said some of the questions will be posed to Zola Tsotsi ""later in the week when he comes"" I think its between Thursday and Friday. Elvis Malakoane" Madala is implicated. He told Mr Pretorius to do as his boss says. The pastor conmen. Slender is heating up now Thando Nkutha. "The strategy of the conman is talk "Mr K Lakhan I said he plans to interrupt What is media shop Person? What is it with chicken? Is it only my phone that shows chicken.
