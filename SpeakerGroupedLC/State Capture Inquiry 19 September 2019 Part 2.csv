Pastor J.J,How about entertaining us with a few comments on ' STATE CAPTURE ENQUIRY' @Deon de Swardt So true. Even I can legally have a few puffs now and no one can rebuke me. Its legal. hahahahahahaha I answered you young man see above @Gee Peex1 The punishment must adequately fit the crime and its impact. It must serve as a means of redemption rather everlasting and unending punishment Wassup bhuti @david cele @david cele Dont make any naughteee today baba sharp bro @Lex Luger My Precious friend. I pray you are well and blessed.Always my brother @david cele I will pray for you My Brother. You are Precious me @Paul Buchel . Strangely. I never ever took or earned a penny whilst serving in Ministry. I am now retired this year and drive a 20 year old car. I cannot afford a holiday 10kms away from home. @Paul Buchel The only jet I have is a model one in the cupboard. Will u like a ride on it Paul? @Paul Buchel . I was on the beach Praying alone when a Dakota with 48 passengers crashed virtually at my feet. No one was injured. What an amazing experience @Paul Buchel I am the same age. It was actually In Isipingo Beach and this particular stretch was renamed Dakota Beach I was there Praying when it happened @Danie Nilsen u are BSOLUTELY 100% RIGHT @Danie Nilsen It crashed in the water 5kms from Louis Botha Airport I have a feeling that @Danie Nilsen was probably a SCOPE magazine fan like me. Particularly the famous centre spread/ @Nicky Klue and Squad Cars on Springbok Radio "Who remembers the 'Rumble in the Jungle"". The fight between Mohammed Ali and George Foreman held in Kampala I think. No TV but was broadcast live on SABC Radio" correct Cassius Clay a.k.aMohammed Ali Yes @Nicky Klue It certainly was Zaire correct. @Danie Nilsen Did we have TV in 1974. I am quite sure we listened on the radio at 10pm @Phankha Sakoane u are right. He was Cassius Clay then Ali was a fighter and Tyson a thug. I watched most of the Jan Wilkens fights.He was a SA Icon loved by all even across colour lines. @Gee Peex1 At the end of his career he was almost killed by an indian wrestler name Tiger Dharbir Singh at Westridge stadium. @Gee Peex1 I was ringside at the fight. that fight was for real bro @Danie Nilsen I have fotos taken with Gerrie Coetzee and Kallie Knoetze. My prized possessions Blessed evening to you all. I have to shower and attend to Prayer requests for today.

Deon de Swardt,Dagga consumed at home is LEGAL. Spanking your child is ILLEGAL. Now you must smoke 4 zols and tell your child he / she was not naughty @lawrence motshoane .... great plan ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ @david cele .... any relation to Bheki ?
Politically Correct,@Mokotjo you are correct I agree with you. I used to believe in what lokota is saying until I realise that he is like Nigerian all politicians are opportunists. drugging legal system in their mess all the time state capture is like watching big brother kind a waste of time time
