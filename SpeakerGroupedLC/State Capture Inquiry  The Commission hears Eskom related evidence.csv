Jenny Whitewaves,Pandora opened the box in her care and let out all the world's ills. In the bottom of the box was hope was left. This commission may be the basis of hope for a corruption free SA we hope He's in a large room with controlled numbers more than 1.5 mts away and aircon when he lets it be on so please just put the mask down  @Tayo being black is nothing to do with her speech Its her education and life skills Leave the colour thing alone  I am English born and bred I would be [;eased to speak as well as this lady. I have an accent many South Africans struggle with unless I moderate it  pleased @Taye no we English have regional accents from which we can tell your area of birth This is taught English @Zip Ah lad iss naugth @zip reeper Nottinghamshire like Robin Hood  What she says about consultants is through out SA There is a municipality who can't pay workers until June but they must still work. They paid consultants R24K last year but don't know what for.  @Taye Pastor is my Christian advisor  @ZAG Consultants I don't think the money ever got to legit consultants probably a wife or daughter/son  So it was Ok to screw Escom for a year until she could be held accountable  @Andile Zondi I think she is diverting She was Ok with the company charging for no work for a year but not if she could be held responsible Now will throw bigger fish out to save her reputation  she blew the whistle when she saw the investigators at the door now wants to hide her part under a pile of other wrong doing  @MERVYN NAIDOO way back at the beginning of the commission some guys who have studied State Capture in several counties showed how it was masterminded in Chile and then these guys refined it  There were always holes in the system of state money handling the previous governments skimmed off the cream these guys killed the cow @Syd Ram the guys who took most were not South African si they knew they would be out of the country when it hit the fan Also i take your point it had to be done before the presidents term was over

Taye,This woman speaks well for a black woman.. She went to private schools? Lerato maybe it is because I am a village boy but here we don't speak English the way this woman does..

Why* Like her accent has a twang. And it is like English is her first language Valencia not too sure which hospital Goat was admitted in. According to what I am reading he attempted to commit suicide by overdosing... Jenny she speaks English like that guy named Trevor Noah.. Zip yeah from what I am reading he attempted suicide... Louis C thanks for understanding ...I think it is the pauses that makes me think that English isn't the the commissioner's strongest suit... "Pastor I am sure how they were talking but there is a screenshot sent to the group chat between Naledi Barron and Goat..if you don't believe me I have a screenshot between Goat and Naledi. Naledi's screenshot is a lion with inspirational words written on it.. Naledi profile pic is a male lion I mean. Lol Louis C Diane oh okay sorry.. No problem Diane Lol Lerato..isn't this woman model c though? Pastor cool you can invite me on that WhatsApp group.. Valencia how is your English if I may ask? "I saw you telling Jenny to check your message on the WhatsApp group  Lol Zondo is charmed... Lol this lady has a cute smile... Jenny oh I see... Louis what do you mean?
