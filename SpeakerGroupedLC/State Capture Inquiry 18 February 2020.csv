Kevin Simon,19:30. Day-night inquiry? "If SARS is on top of their game "Yesterday the amount being investigated appeared to be R2m. However
David Naidoo,error 7.30 starts at 9.30. am. must be an error. enca says 10 am. not sure whats going on. should have started at 9.30am.
Eliot Chauke,pm or am 🙏🏿 Mr X knows English Zulu privilege Kate Hofmeyer is the reason why Zondo will apply for another extension
Lorna Kavanagh,Why does it say live in 9 hours? All this stoken money could have benefited many mam Myeni had her sticky fingers in many looting projects ..
Denise Lakey,It's a SECRET 🙈🙈🙈 Night court is back in S.A. "We're live..hoo Live on 404 "Out of sheer ignorance dude and Majola can send pics Orkay😦 "If he understands English They should all go and doedoe (sleep) and leave our children to manage SOE's I'm back on 404.See yah😎
World Justice News,Zondo did say 9:30am
Margareth Waterboer,"Gosh @Denise Lakey...he fears for his life...he was threatened "They know

BIG D,wow I wouldn't know where to start with this bunch of strange characters
Damaking Alie,Mr X is the man.?...who is been interrogated.?.....
FieliesSA,Mr Xis being interrogated and the other lady is the interpreter Mr X more comfortable in Zulu for clarity She still sounds tons better(flcomfortable) than the Afrikaans interpreter for Basson(state capture inquiry) and even the other guy at Neil Agetts inquiry @Tholithemba Ntsele You mean morphed Zulu. A Zulu prevalent amongst urban/ younger blacks. The same has happened to afrikaans. Even English... You don't know how to appreciate. That is a very expensive Bosch mike. R50K for the purchase and set-up :P:P (and yes that's sarcasm * with a hint of concern) @See Earth. There is a very fine line between being hopeful and naive... @See Earth Rather be cautiously optimistic. "@See Earth Not true. Those of us who knew @Roza essack Proudly South African. The Guptas learned from the Miyeni's and Zuma's... @Concerned South African Yes that was one of the translations that Miyeni charged the VNA water board. This is Mr X and Majola @Dominic Przybylski Because they were effectively rendered useless during Zuma administration... I cant wait for Mr Majola. His responses will be Mr Miyeni V2.0 "To do that they will have to amend constitution. And when it was created That bosch mic as standing there costs ca R6 K. I wonder what the company is charging the inquiry for renting and setup fees... "If we(the citizens of SA) really want to punish the government for gross misuse and looting of funds @Zeekat Punishment will(hopefully) come when the new government fix what the current one tore apart @TG Swartlane I think she is as I also looked for that wedding ring 😛 "I also withdraw. Yes its just some innocent joking. Plus its flattery 👍 Plus Im already married to the best wife and wouldn't want to trade her for anything💍 @Firas Aziq looks like a scam account... #MindBlown #BombShells "To all who dont want to be hacked or scammed I reported Firas as spam(Bot spamming) @Zeekat You had my attention at Majora 😀 LOLOLO! Nope thats the witness stand 😞 Nice Mic @Zeekat LOL! Wish I could see Zondo or Hofmeyer... "@Dominic Przybylski I think thats just it. We dont need them @TG Swartlane Hey your starting again 😛 BMW deposit
Wilson M,Whos Mr Majola
Sthakathi Khumalo,Wavele waphahluka uZondo😂😅; Mr X - bathi uMajola😅 "Someone once said Page - ikhasi I think.. interpreter udlala ngathi😂😂😂 "Apparently chair slipped and called Mr X - Majola Earlier on uZondo uphahlukile wambiza ngoMajola - manje ngididekile ukuthi ubani lomunye uMajola😩 By the time Mr X evidence concludes - uzogcina ekhuluma isingisi😂😂😂 Anne.M spot on with the Gavin comparison!! "Is Mr X a majola also "Thibedi Shai I feel you Thibedi Shai I am sure its to try and protect him from new request to take him out - but ya the entity part is just an miss too Now SABC decides to show us an empty chair - thixo Poor daughter kodwa The same banks who have been involved in scandals - some have even admitted to manipulating currency. Umbhoshongo - now thats a word right there!! "Someone once said if you steal in English Dont start with apartheid - please De Klerk owes the whole nation an apology and repentance program "ANC is detached from the masses Mtokozisi Baleni The real state capturers are the ones running banking - these ones being investigated here are small fries!! Struggle credentials and entitlement go hand in hand with ANC! "Ow wow Dudu taking young lions under her wing hehe Haai haai Hofmeyer uyaGeja suka!! "Uyageja losisi suka Kodwa mara - I was never ready!! Mr Mpho Oksalayo - banamanga 😂😂 Firas Aziq bhala inamba lapha zikhona izinsizwa ezishimile 😛 Mr Mpho Peer pressure ingozi 😛 Does he have a recording or memory? Lets us be careful of drawing conclusions with one side of the story.. Firas leave your email and we will text you later but here we are addressing serious matters!! "SABC please now
Jabu Malinga,"com on now "Mr X is not innocent "yes "If ppl r irritated that he uses an interpretor etc "Water boards r mostly corrupt. ppl hav no water The ppl who stole the money and bankrupted UGU are known. politically connected MM and d company who paid for the ANC bday bash in Port Shepstone.connect d dots "Tholi "The water truck companies and guys selling water tanks are minting it "water is flowing into the sea while daily the sabc ppl looking at these comments should pass our leads onto the commission "Dudu is the crime boss "Zuma was Dudus boss "Gupta was Zuma boss "Gee Peex1 "I don't think many of u are really following the evidence "it is clear that this witness "Pheladi "Delinquient director..dudu was running SAA "Carte Blanche Koko. ""lets just say it was a mistake "u can giv our politicians another 30 years "Edward "Anya Can I also get that money for doin nothing and get a tender too? please "please Ma Dudu please.. all these dudus.. dudu myeni 
Rory Lee Farnham,If this guy gets cross examined he will be swallowed up and will have zero credability. "Mr X does not need an interpretor. This is a farce. Make no mistake
Pheladi Lamola,"@Denise Lakey It is the community members he's scared of. If they were to see him giving testimony Mr X did make money from all this through the interest he'd earn in the money market account You're absolutely right @mxolisi buthelezi. I've been asking myself why they didn't notice the movement of monies that big. Why don't they show us Ms interpreter today instead of that empty chair? Yeah people can be nasty to others sometimes. "If Mr Majola is listening to this he'll just say I never gave such instructions Your secretary may have just saved you there Mr X. Judge Zondo's sense of humour 👌😃😃 @Jabu Malunga you'll have to be connected to people in high places to get such tenders where you get millions for doing nothing. Mr X is much better at business compared to that Myeni guy yesterday. So is Mr Majola in this room now or is he in a waiting room? Yes @goo breen. Just after Mr X Yes judge. Totals please @Sidney P even DCJ commended her earlier saying she's doing very well today. I of course thought she was doing great yesterday too🤣🤣🤣 Premier is Myeni's business. Thalente Myeni. Are you serious @Sidney P? I thought she was perfect. But then again I am Pedi so 🤷‍♀️ I missed that 🤣🤣
Andre G,"He said people involved will know him

Jackround Ali,all Right
Maryann Diamond,amen indeed true hence now they w s nt to start a state bank too "want """ yup cuz they got a cut "agreed  lol agreed lol yup me too true anya 11:15 he was sooooooo used amen banks were given a cut now state wants to open a state bank ... wow what happened yesterday ? yup indeed I jnow @Oscar.. its a joke cant beat them join them agreeed yaaaaas zeekat amen Rosa they wanna kill him booom lol DA !!!! hmmmmm reaal the sona at 2 its a date
mxolisi buthelezi,@Pheladi Lamola that mean that Banks are corruption enablers...they must be held accountable Do you want the job @Tholithemba Ntsele ? So even amaZulu are 'discriminating' against their own. Uyabona nje i-tribalism is dangerous... kodwa qhubekani @Sthakathi Khumalo hahahahaha you're funny. I agree "@Mabutho Mabaso trust me I get it. What you don't get is that languge/culture is not static. With urbanization @Tholithemba Ntsele fair enough...
Granny Mokwena,i think Mr X is our second Agrizzi the banks must account surely some movements of these monies must have raised suspicion "guys "millions and millions of taxpayers money given to people who have done nothing
anya van loggerenberg,did mrx drop any names yet? he has a right to an interpreter regardless if he needs on or not @Mabutho Mabaso its true though these people just cant do numbers thats why the country is a mess @Isaac Mutasa on the dot @Daniel Prinsloo nothing @Daniel Prinsloo the taxpayer @Mbuso Ndlovu no its the taxpayer not the poor "@See Earth wrong people have no morals or ethics "money does nothing to people people are corrupt...not money @Denise Lakey making sure he understands everything
Mabutho Mabaso,"Judge does a better job at interpreting "@Tholithemba @Mxolisi Buthelezi you have completely missed the point. It’s been explained very clearly. "@Mxolisi Buthelezi reads like you agree @isaac mutasa we can attack more than 1 issue at the same time. Don’t involve us in your inability to multitask.
Musa Mabunda,"@Rory Lee Farnham yes he did make money "@Tholithemba Ntsele he madoda "@Eliot Chauke yes he does "@Gee Peex1 he did @Mtokozisi Baleni then he chairperson of the commission and courts will decide @Mbuso Ndlovu he's the next witness @Pheladi Lamola then the chair will make his findings "@Thandile Nkoyi and he wants it now
kamogelo terena,LOL
MULOIWA RODNEY,lol
keletso letsoalo,LOL
Val Ansley,I wonder if he needs the word MONEY interpreted
Simphiwo Matiso,Mr X YOU ARE TOO MUCH JONK its just a child haha amabhubesi amancane hahahaha
Sibusiso Mthokozisi Dubazana,"Mr X hisself did infact indicate that he understands english well but felt more comfortable speaking zulu to properly describe the events that took place. This fuss about ""joburg zulu"" is unnecessary" Isnt he supposed to testify next? Mr Myeni has selective amnesia
Mtokozisi Baleni,@ Tholithemba true Alex issue should also be opened but i ges the scope for commission had its targeted people in mind @Musa he wants to turn around and say i was miss quoted....Isizulu vs English @Musa the chair understand and speaks original zulu not this Jo'burg mixture @Sthakathi Majola is the key/star witness @Pheladi am sure the hairstyle sold her out or camera pressure @ Jabu easy to follow its money laundering and corruption it looks like Majola is a Big crook he did sign anything or wrote any email. he would come in in person an issue instructions. He knows what he was doing @Isaac Isizulu is a major language we have a right to be concerned if its not interpreted correctly Sir @Sthakathi lets hope the End wont be the same like poor Gavin Watson bathroom time mr X all these huge cash withdrawals .....banks failed to raise a red flag.....banks were part of state capture what on earth is happening in SA it looks like there is no clean business anymore. Middle man is the business now @Clive i hve heard that statement before..... "@Sydney P you will hear nothing from Majola @Sidney P very true it is what it is @Loyiso Mr X is camera shy everybody involved now know who he is @Peter Sant Apartheid was wrong.... Corruption is wrong Zuma was a terrible President @Peter Sant i fully agree. its the only way forward but also watch him too hes still from the same club ANC @Peter Sant i agree i can't think of anyone even from opposition interpreter spot on now
Pastor J.J,@Gee Peex1 ...The Commissions Lawyers. @Gee Peex1 ...It is perfectly legal. But in a Court of Law it needs to be Qualified to ensure that the Interpretation was done correctly. That does ring a bell @Anne M. Many bells actually @Sibusiso Hadebe ....Indeed very very true Unfortunately yes @Anne M. ...Birds of a feather comes to mind "I respect and appreciate that this man "Evidence so far is that MrX was the conduit and Mr Majola was the postman/messenger for Dudu who then reported to big boss a.k.a No1. And that is not the Prisoner no @Wendy Greeff ...Thats surprising. This is a commission and the subjudice rules apply only when a matter is in a Court environment. But then again....... "@Dominic Przybylski ..@Anne M. ..@Elvis Malakoane ..What are your thoughts on a Selection vs.Election process for Government Representatives? MP""s etc. including the President and Cabinet." They can only strip benefits if he is impeached@makhosi nobhatyi "And what about killers like the ""Krugersdorp Killers"". Should they all receive the death sentence as well?..@Zeekat" @Person of interest ..100%correct And so was he during the trial of those killers. He didnt want the young girl to go to jail for even a day and abused anyone who said so. Therein lies the reason for the question@Person of interest @Zeekat ...What do you think? Doom or Mortein.??? Thats the menu for today @Firas Aziq ...whats your choice? Doom/Mortein or Rattex. Sorry but no Whoonga on the menu today.
Mbuso Ndlovu,Where is Mr Majo;la????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? @Musa Mabunda We can't wait to hear his side of the story😀😁😂😂😁😀 @Zibuyile Luthuli Majola will probably not remember much like Mr Myeni😀😁😂 @Daniel Prinsloo You and Me and the rest of poor people
Anne M.,@Gee Peex1 Mr X stated he can read and write English. He prefers to speak in his mother tongue while giving evidence. @Gee Peex1 I'm not sure what you mean? @Gee Peex1 I have no idea @Pheladi Lamola Maybe the interpreter saw the nasty comments about her hair yesterday and asked not to be filed. *filmed "@Mtokozisi Baleni Yes @Pastor J 😀 The modus operandi of skelms doesn't differ too much. Correction 11:15 @Roza essack He owns his own company which had dealings with Mhlathuze Water "@Roza essack Yes he speaks English @Mtokozisi Baleni Yes they were "@BeachDude420 Peters As far as I know BOOM!!
Martin Muks Napoleon,hoo

EDWARD ZVAVAREYI,hey hey hey "true Mr Majola hey banna? It may not matter much someone will be in jail thats for certain. wish all commissions are contacted this way. Monthlante falls way below this standard. Well done. You have a feeling people are given a chance to speak up N defend themselves. I smell IJELE kodwa Its difficult but something must effort must be done to try and protect identities of such witnesses. Its difficult though! any little protection baba Difficult to implicate banks. Ungalandi imali yakho at most times the bank will give it to you. How ever most banks are complicit in shoddy deals. Shame why do you insist on seeing the interpreter. Such cases need very professional people who have to be protected. Hey hey Majola ibosso! Hey No bogus commission here this is serious. This is corruption! hahaha tjo tjo. hahahha i wothdraw if you see it that way. its just appreciation Ms Myeni?????? Hey!!! I trust the witness. To be honest why would he go to these lengths. judge is not confused. He is spot on Why are you telling us you are 25 Firaz
Isaac Mutasa,Africans will be concerned about an interpreter speaking diluted Zulu and not millions of Rands looted by the ANC kleptocrats who you keep returning to power. Judge Zondo flirting with the interpreter kkkkkk
Sibusiso Hadebe,Group of thugs. They should be locked up. Poor people are suffering because of this rampant corruption Same as Bosasa. This is Agrissi no 2 I want to see this Mr Majola what would be his evidence in all this. Our our country is a mess
Raymond Fitzgerald,hear hear u soo correct we need another interpreter to see if she is translating correctly me too please and still don't know where it came from why cant they be perhaps arrested this would shake all the bloody routes out of the trees they are robbing is blind o we have to take on extra work as pensioners well said but they still vote with their hearts or a packet of food not with their heads
Daniel Prinsloo,Can anyone tell me what is going to happen to all these crooks @anya - who is paying for this commission

It is the candle in the dark. @Sthakathi Khumalo agreed. His stupid comments have caused serious issues and he owes us all a very heartfelt apology. "@Dominic Przybylski you have to admit though that if it wasn't for this commission We need more accountability. that's what would really create optimism. @Dominic Przybylski THAT is the million dollar question. We will have to wait and see "@FieliesSA that's different "@Dominic Przybylski again @Dominic Przybylski there is a groundswell that has been created through the information that is coming out here.

It confirms the lack of light at the end of the tunnel. This is just the tip of the iceberg. @See Earth and what are we going to do with what we know now? Prosecute a handful of people and replace them with a new crowd of political criminals? @See Earth There is no cure possible without a complete change of social culture. @See Earth We live in a country where meritocracy is a dirty word. "@See Earth ""Mr X"" has asked for this limited anonymity because he knows that the majority of the voting public are not interested and will remain unaware of these revelations." @Roza essack You assume these people have a conscience. The only people who have taken Dudu to court are OUTA. Hawks and NPA missing in action. "And we have such a clueless or corrupt billionaire President that he was ""shocked"" by existence of state capture "The entire state apparatus is corrupt @Oscar N The cost of this enquiry is peanuts compared to what is stolen by members of our SOE's every week. @Oscar N Definitely. @goo breen Ubaba doesn't know.
