Noreply Internet,I hope this process prevails justice for this country.
Nelson Musoliwa,Prime Minister by default continues with his testimony at Zondo comm Vavi malema blade and others played a prominent role in zuma ascendancy to power bt t consequence might have less to do with them Owen Pravin is trying to explain economic vicious circle SA was subjected to by clumsy zuma decision as he got no clue about economy It is obvious that Collective Leadership history in ANC never saw the light of the day during Zuma era. It was only about him and his friends guptas included

Why is he teaching economics 098(extended programe) ? @Fort Free he has to earn it like everyone else through VOTING @thoko we already know it we need state capture so PG i going to talk about media report? @Lony Lou no when ANC took power things were already messed up now PG is cross-examining DCJ? and PG did not bring the text book? where are the questions ? what did they ask? @Mondli Mfeka its always like that with religion 27 question. 53cent ft PG i thought Zondo asked what the question said not "7 Did the minister of finance receive the KPMG report? If yes "5 Kindly explain why Sars re-employed Ivan Pillay for three years and then extended his contract to five years. In short
Makwa Choma,"This state capture we are watching today is because of Blade Who elect a president such as that one to lead a country such as ours Job u have the fact I agree with you Eff and Blf have problems with indians We should hold our frustration PG is not corrupt as EFF like as to believe National party brought and architected apartheid and practice it on us n was not given opportunity to reform it.

Job Mokolutlo,The fundamental question the ANC must answer in this inquiry is what did they aim to achieve by deploying an illiterate person to be the Head of state! PG said Politics is not a career! I hope Municipal Councillors are listening to this ethical leader very attentively! PG says he is not a commodity for sale! How many of the ANC deployees can say this without contradiction! @Nkutha. Talk and sloganeering is very much critical. How else did Zuma become the President without any formal education? @Dave! You must serioursly self-introspect on the hogwash perception you hold of Blacks against Indians! @Sandile. Go ask Dudu Myeni @Singh. How many Black Africans benefitted from the profits made by the US CEO? @Nkutha. I so hope you could move on from your toxic dialogue with this guy. You are much better than that! The silent coup is exposed and defeated! "@Trucker. Zondo inquiry could do well with your fake IQ. Please "At the conclusion of this inquiry "@Sivuyile. SA cannot be fixed using the same ethics that broke it. Rupert under Apartheid broke SA "Guys PG is not a criminal as paraded by EEF & BLF opportunists. But one thing is for sure that you mess with him at your risk.Ask Shaun Abrams and the entire ESKOM board @Freeme. Did you wish to call him anything bad perharps? "@Sandile. PG is legally expected to submit evidence to ZONDO PG lectures ZONDO on the impact of global rating Agencies reviews on SA economy. I hope you all listen attentively before you offer uninformed analysis as it is becoming fashionable! @Nkutha. It is not a crime to have met the Guptas unless you are as paranoid as EEF & BLF Opportunists @Nkutha. Are you sure of his response in Parliament or is it just your mind playing tricks with you to find any dirt on him? @Lony Lou. What exactly do you know about Blacks that we do not know about ourself? "@Lony Lou. And I bet you happy when the NATS were running SA @LONY LOU. Apartheid did a great job in indoctrinating you with this hogwash! We await PG to make a submission on his dismissal as FM on the basis of fake Intelligence Report. There is a serious charge of Treason awaiting somebody at the conclusion of this inquiry @MichaelHolmes. Of course! SA is geographically south of the African continent. Your comment is so disappointing!

Athmanand Singh,The Millions of Rands that have lined the pockets of the Tender preneurs and Zuma and Gupta contacts have deprived millions of our country men of homes and basic services.
