HALO,Anyone interested in a new cryptocurrency that you can mine for on your smartphone? It's free. "The cryptocurrency app is not my app "The cryptocurrency app is called ""Pi Network"" and it's available to download on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store." "You dont have to pay any money The cryptocurrency doesn't have any value yet because it's only launching on the markets later this year. "Remember "Don't regret not taking this opportunity for ""Pi Network""." "You cannot be robbed by using ""Pi Network"". Stop jumping to conclusions" You just download the app and mine the coins. They don't ask you for your banking details "Valencia stop* Go read about Pi Network "In 2008 if I told yourll about bitcoin you would've said the same thing Valencia the type of woman who craves attention and is obsessed with being looked at because of her conceited nature But yet bitcoins assets are now worth over 15 trillion rands so what do you say about that? You just made a fool of yourself. It's not a scheme. If Pi Network were to fail then all those who mined for the free coins wouldn't have lost any money.🙂👍 It's can't be a scheme if you don't lose ANY MONEY 🙂 "Anyone saw how many predictions The Simpsons made that actually came true "Hey ""men"" It really is the end times....😑 Have some respect for that lady And most probably a criminal "And I thought that old people supposed to be wise. But then again "This country is screwd Calm down 🙂 "Valencia I wonder how much money they gave to that other puppet Malema "@Pastor J.J "@Pastor J.J

BanditZA,She was the CEO!!! I’m blocking H A L O cryptocurrency ACS Scam This woman is not beautiful what are you guys smoking  😂 60% of ZA woman are obese so you have your pickings of “non toothpick women” “That thing” is probably because she is flirty and bubbly  Agreed that’s attractive  What other companies has this woman run  Lol @ “bedroom smile” Just block halo and move on with life  She is a complete farce  Email was not submitted  Zondo ✊🏽💪🏽 Praise to Mthiyane 🙏🏽 "Hail "Hail Thumbela will protect us  Now she wants to cry  Yeah I want them to nail her  She will stop smiling very fast these matters are not a joke. She contributed @Shirley Tilley indeed! Ex ceo of Gupta firm trillion  *Trillian  If anyone here votes for the ANC again after all this you are completely deluded  Rather vote for IFP or your regional parties and let them form a coalition at national level  This ANC is rotten and my father was a freedom fighter card carrying ANC member  ANC has sullied the memory of my dead father completely. They have no respect for ancestors  I didn’t say don’t vote EFF.  "Anything is better than these clowns DA is lost that’s why I said regional parties  Something needs to change  EFF has too much hate. I supported them when they launched but after the things they have said I can’t support them  We can only help Africa if we help ourselves first  After we become stable we can simply invade Zimbabwe and Mozambique to effect regime change
