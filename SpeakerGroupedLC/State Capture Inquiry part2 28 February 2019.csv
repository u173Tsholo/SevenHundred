Kopanotj Molele,What happened to sound?
Dominic Przybylski,The witness has been silenced by SABC What's right with SABC? Decent volume. Keep it up SABC Most cabinet ministers know very little about their portfolios so many looking for a Guptarish person to make decisions for them. They did nothing because they don't understand ethics and integrity. Very unfortunate for the rest of the country. President didn't have a clue about running a country. That is the fault of the people who decided to make him president and the fault of the people who voted for a party who chose him as their leader I'm waiting to see if anybody gets to be held accountable under Ramaphosa. He was 2nd in command during Zuma's reign. He has a lot to account for. Why did he look the other way? The abuse of government in South Africa means that government has become an abuser of the citizens. We need to find a new way to govern ourselves. We need to forget about race. It's used as an excuse but never as a reason. NEC is same as AU - club for abusers. If it was not the true reason then he must have heard more than a mumble. This man doesn't remember any specifics. Indication of somebody who didn't have a handle on his job. What were the changes that he made. One example please. Yose Human blocked. Cyril is suspect.
Yvonne Morudu,what is wrong with sabc cant someone report this please only 18 months is that portfolio one could see you could stay bcz you are not a thug my comrade leader.. bravo sphiwe bravo my comrade leader the country will remember you... you serve the country well Moira don't worry things are going to be okay all the crooks are going to jail watch the space James we need stability.. my appeal to you white south Africans even if you don't like ANC let's all vote Cyril to give him mandate EFF will spirit our country no ways that is disaster let's safe the country please guys let's vote Cyril

I love listening to this stuff cause i get to see some people's true colours and agendas. we also get to learn exactly how this government is built! i dont mean built like develop etc. goodness no some will be famous for breaking lives! I meant how this goverment and politics etc are put together and how actions are intertwined etc. i wonder how these skelms can look their children in the eye... knowing they destroyed lives!! they should die of shame after they pay the money back...
The Vuka Experience,Guys I missed Trevor Manuela testimony! Is it worth watching again? Typo😂 "Ok thanks guys.

Victor Muthundinne,Living the party is not a solution. Better the devil you know
Paul Mufhadi,The ANC cadres knew exactly was going on that is why they did not bother to ask Zuma why is this happening. so the country was run from the Gupter compound. The ANC leaders are shameless. Zuma was not confronted about this cause it is ubaba finish en klaar They knew all these and they chose to keep quiet yet the country was being sold. Now the country must give them chance? I do not think so. "so what is the NEC for if they do not hold each other accountable for the things they do or say
