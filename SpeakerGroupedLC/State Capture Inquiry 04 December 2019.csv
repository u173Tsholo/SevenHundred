skeetpetegibbs,Turn up your volume Bianca
Maxwell Sibiya,Boring üò¥üò¥ Who is the next witness after him? @Pastor J. thank you. that sounds more interesting for me than this. I'll just read or watch highlights in regards to his testimony. I'll come back here for the next witness Oh yeah. let's get this going
Pastor J.J,Shame man @Maxwell Sibiya ....Have you tried watching paint dry? Just curious Bro We should be proud as a Nation that we are developing and have in our midst such amazing talent as we see in Alister Chabi. We need to encourage and support more Alister's. @Bianca Arnold ....Actuary he is "@Jacqui Baumgardt ...Particularly the ""under the table"" issues. hahahahaha. Just my immense sense of humor" @LED BULPS ...He is an Expert Witness and not an Incriminated Party. Lets not hook him up @Elvis Malakoane ...Wassup bro. Where have you been You give us too much credit but thank you very much@LED BULPS . @Bianca Arnold ...We also miss you when you are not here. @LED BULPS ...I was watching and it got boring. Perhaps after lunch @Ditiro Mawai ....Anyone honest? @Ditiro Mawai ...We need a Non Political Mayor. Jozi needs an honest Mayor who works for the betterment of the People rather than following a Party line to our detriment "@Derek Main ...Fana "" the Gupta Skelm"" Hlongwana" @Robert Mugabe Gucci Grace's new boyfriend. Tooo soon for that...are u a bit jealous???? hehehehehe "@Maggie Render .....Some of us didn't believe him even when he said"" I am Fana Hlongwane""" I have a urge. To give this arrogant fella a running klap and extract the truth....Someone please stop me. always bro I get the impression that this fool does not respect women. It seems that Park Station would have been more private than the Curry Den Then how do you know a Gupta walked in if you didnt see? @redriger I wouldn't wash my jalopy with that rag @Gee Peex1 .....Mr Gupta threatened to kill him if he ever revealed what happened @Gee Peex1 .....Try and suppress the stupidity. It is a quote. @Gee Peex1 ..You have asked the same question for the upmteenth time in the last 3months. The answers will not change Their was an attempt but the Hawks presented him with an already prepared statement. No trust. No report No one and no one is above the law@Gee Peex1 . Recently not even the No1 skelm @Gee Peex1 ..In any event. The incident was reported to the then PP. Subsequently to the Hawks by David Maynier of the DA. Only a Confirmatory statement was required from Mr Jonas. The content and context of the PP report will never be considered Hearsay. It is and was reported as a fact@Gee Peex1 @Person of interest ...That jacket has potential. Too wash cars maybe?

funicanz,"@Maxwell Sibiya  "@Ricus Ellis  Is Mr Chabi finished with his testimony? Uncle Fana is on the stand. "@Sthakathi Khumalo  Mr Hlongwana is here to collaborate Duduzane's version. "The rumor that has no substance that they had to call a ""private meeting"" for it?!" "@Bianca Arnold  The rumor was to lure Jonas to Saxowold. "From a rumor This oke concurs Zuma's story of the same meeting yet he can't recall anything said by Jonas.:wow "@Sthakathi Khumalo  "@Sthakathi Khumalo  "@Sthakathi Khumalo  "@Victor 
bongile sango,They've called this guy again
thando cezula,Mornings! Who's this?
Jacqui Baumgardt,Morning all actually the only finances that interest me are my bank balances @Stronger together - wishing you success! @Lucky123 Thwala - he only questions liars @Derek Main - agree @Pastor J - agree - he has a brilliant understanding "@SAM STORIES - he's a lawyer "six of one and half a dozen of the other "I was referring to Mr Zondo - he's a lawyer which is why he's not a fan of tables ü§£ these ladies are bringing it! First time I've seen her DCJ will be doing a lot of questioning of this guy - he picks up on the lies This guy is a patriarchist @willie maphosa - you should see what Shakespeare would have said Huh? so rude agree what about cadre? üòÅ speak up! DCJ will trip him up "‚ÄúThe rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril‚Äù The Merry Wives of Windsor (Act 3
Eliot Chauke,Avuxeni i better watch Peter Moyo v Trevor Manuel/Old Mutual case uncle Fana Fana Hlongwane Mr Duduzane Zuma DCJ must stop putting words in Hlongwane's mouth Zondo must leave Uncle Fana alone Jonas never reported the matter. he just spoke to media why did jonas remain dep. minister
Makwa Choma,"Watseba when watching this state capture it makes one hate the ANC so much infact am going to be a serial beater redriger not a joke Our country will be the best in the world with money looted by indians Anc stupid how can they be captured by indians who just arrived in our country
Ricus Ellis,I agree with you Makwa MY STAR WITNESS The Chair is so bored by Mr Chabi's knowledge of finance that he cant wait for the interview to finish. He needs a tea break Led Bulps you are spot on Montana will not be so lucky now "vertaal dit asb in engels This does not help me. Please give me what those verses actually say. I do not posses a bible Far too arrogant for this young lady.The chair should protect her. Thank you for protecting the young lady DCJ. Adv Hoffmeyer shoud be interogating this sly fellow Dont forget the ARMs deal
Zukile Tshiwula,This boy is very clever and hs prepared himself very well and cautious.

The Xilaman,@Makwa üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Derek Main,@Makwa Choma Pure greed. The ANC is corrupt to the core. Still plundering. Chabi seems like a very smart guy. Someone he Hawks could use to delve into corporate corruption. @Maria Raboshakga And yet the same criminals get voted into power time and again. We have only ourselves to blame. Who is this witness please? @Pastor J Aaah - thanks. The Arms Deal fixer himself. @Ongeziwe Unathi Lusaseni @Phillip Cwazibe Thanks guys Along-time criminal. He epitomises the rot in the ANC. @Zukile Mawisa Yes - an accomplished liar. @Robert Mugabe Fana Hlongwana @Phillip Cwazibe Yes - same one. He was corrupt a long time before the Guptas arrived. @lesley klinck Unfortunately I don't think so. He's a well-practised liar. @Pastor J I've got your back.
SAM STORIES,Goodluck @Stronger Together didn't the Chair mention that he isn't much of a fan of tables? true @ Jacqui I told you'll. The Chair wants this over and done soon. He can't take it anymore @ Brendan they did have 'something' hence they got those tenders. That 'something' was connections like a 50cent was more than a 5bob Yep Who is the next witness? Jozi's new mayor it is who is this guy? oh boy. I'm so sorry I asked Thanks LED imagine grown man having a third party arrange a meeting to settle a matter that arose from a rumour he has to be subpoenaed to attend a commission of enquiry but willing to attend a meeting to adress a rumour @ Stronger let's just say he makes more sense when he is quiet than he is when he is talking
Arnie Naidoo,Best wishes for your interview ST ST this fella is parraballating on the outskirts of vebosity
Lucky123 Thwala,my chairman today is very quiet not like yesterday questioning Baloyi what is the name of evidence leader chairman has employed more staff this man is a foooool
Rob Nel,"@Stronger together  "After watching some of our parliamentarians it is a pleasure Actuarial scientist Holds ab BEconScie degree from WITS The comrade is wearing a very retro jacket Could the meeting not have been handled by conference call? "Strange how these guys have memory loss "if you are blackmailed "No privacy at the Hyatt. They then get privacy Agree "Is there a difference between Friend and Comrade That as well Jacqui
adrian albertyn,time wasting instead of opinions formulas must be applied surely chabi can give us a professional opinion on what went wrong instead of prolonging this nonsense actuaries apply statistical history and must refrain from giving opinions. they thought the dollar and the yen was one and the same they were plain dof about hedging chabi has got his limitations
Brendan Rampath,"Sorry I am late are we back on Transnet? thanks how can you be awarded a tender for something you do not have? @LED BULPS more like corruption
Sthakathi Khumalo,I remember this accent üòÖ... unkabi ubuyile Is this uncle Fana that little D nxamalala was referring to "Phillip Cwazibe Thanks "DCJ is smart "Where is Hoffmeyer "The evidence leader is KEY Chair step in now.. He will just corroborates Duduzane's evidence aha "I think this comrade is like this generally "I think she is doing pretty okay "We won't get anything to be honest funicanz SO when Zondo writes his report what do you think he is likely to recommend in this saga - who was lying here? "Norman Zwane Ngiyakuzwa Mangethe "funicanz Thats true Nothing attained here!!
Anthony Ramasike,he is an actuary she is a bookworm @Sam...definately correct
LED BULPS," " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
Lincoln Noko,Man Brain Alert: I wonder how is this lady in the B room.
mandisi ntauzana,Why would a spec have Yen and Dollar yet the hedge is in Dollar? this is crazy and obviously this currency confusion will mean the hedge does not benefit transnet and its pointless NPV of this will lower........ This bid was in shumbles 20E = R30. 9m as per 2013 Adv Sello should follow what is being said "100 Locomotives 19E modification by CSR is crazy and hegde of Dollar v ZAR didn't benefit as the memo was in Yen.......... just crazy "100 and 1064 locomotives........ done for now
Zukile Mawisa,The expert with an accent is back. Only if he can tell us what is happening in simple English. I don't understand what this guy is saying. I'm sure the only people who understand Chabi are Chabi and himself. A confident liar. Too sure of himself. "Looks very expensive too Rob. Our money Fana
Maria Raboshakga,Zukile Mawisa Lol "This commission is very depressing indeed. The billions stolen by so called leaders is really heart-wrenching
Ditiro Mawai,i would also like to place on record that the commission should resume with arrests ASAP join us as we are to appoint Jozi's new mayor join us as we are to appoint Jozi's new mayor "None Maaka fela rewritten on his face Maaka fela rewritten on his face
Apollo Asiimwe,ok
Phillip Cwazibe,@Gee Peex1 ‚Äã Exodus 1:13 and all following verses. John 29:11 and all other following verses. @ Derek Main ‚Äã He is Fana Hlongwane @ Sthakathi Khumalo Yebo. @ Sthakathi Khumalo ‚Äã I did not listen to Chabi. Too complicated for me. @ Pastor J ‚Äã@Maggie Render . I think it is the same Fana Hlongwane who gets mentioned in the Arms Deal. @ Yezwe Nxumalo ‚Äãi the lady is playing someone but her true personality.
Ongeziwe Unathi Lusaseni,@Derek Main it's Fana Hlongwana @Robert Mugabe üò±üò±üò±
Toibo wa Toibo Antimba,Uncle Fana of Duduzane
Robert Mugabe,what's happening Who is he?
Abongile Nohayi,who is this guy? who is the evidence leader?
VUYANI PETER,"Zondoz ears have listened to so many lies
Maggie Render,I do not believe this version. I am pleased that I am not the only one. Jonas is supposed to be a friend so why all the secrecy. I believe Jonas's version 150%
willie maphosa,@Zukile Mawisa very expensive but tasteless too. I guess the more weatlhy you become the more tasteless in terms of dress sense. I wouldn't wear that for a million dollar üòÉ @Phillip Cwazibe yes he is "very arrogant "Its a game he tries to play "pathological liar "Watchout "The Commission personnel is paid by the state @Person of interest hahaha - so true
Mkhatshwa Mpendulo,Mr D i don't remember i don't understand i think the lady has to slow down too i think she is an intern. the lady will end up emotional.
John Fagan,WHAT A LIAR HE'S ARROGANT YES HE IS LOL INDEED Anathi commrades i believe they different is he not up for corruption something to do about HEALTH

Solly Patsane,"The arrogance of this man
Anathi Sikobi,Inconceivable that grown ups can approach a youngster to mediate
Ozzy Ozzy,Stop pulling your face lana wena uncle Fana Loves the young man and the Guptas He thinks he smarter than everyone uncle fana hahah lol Mr Zondo
Person of interest,Jonas was lured. this oke needs a smack. Deliberately going round in circles. Adv Hofmeyr must come. "Yes Pastor But Hofmeyr got balls... KATE! This should have been much easier. witness is being difficult. He is not going to give us anything useful this one. "Yes Jacqui "I am peripheral judge Judge gonna sort fana out before lunch "But Fana Very odd Well rehearsed to deceive Fishy for sure "Wonderful counsel No progress "He intimidates her His jacket is a bigger puzzle for me than his replies... Judge misses nothing
Thozamile Yapi,"This lady will lose it
Malisti04,uDuduzane ungenaphi kumgosi
Khaya Nomoyi,Of rumours and mutton curry. Why would Mr Jonas go to a useless meeting about rumous organised by a young man? Ordinarily Xhosa man wouldn't do that let alone a deputy minister. Was this rumour about making of a nuclear weapon that we cant hear it.He is actually lying with a straight face to protect the Guptas and Duduzane.
bekithemba masa,"the problem with statecapture Zombies is that they hav written their own scripts about certain individuals
Tshepo Mahlangu,do you think this advocate is sharp enough for this witness? I hear you @Sthakathi Khumalo
Ashne Hesselberg,"@siabonga Moloi
Norman Zwane,@Ditiro Mawai I get the same feel. If lies were a person they would look like Mr Fana Hlongwane "@Sthakathi Khumalo The main puppet - Zuma would clearly show that the Guptas were pulling his strings @Person of interest I think it is clear Fana is concealing a lot. Right now this matter has been well rehearsed to mislead.
Market Signal,Sunday Monday
Victor,This guy is boring if you are accused of blackmailing you dont take headon with the person? He is hiding something @SAM STORIES I dont understand his sanity
Lwandile Radebe,@Vicror very
Pheladi Lamola,"Fana knows very well that in the ANC Liar. He thinks he's clever but DCJ is onto him.
Patience Moeti,The way he talks it really sounds there is no truth in him
Kung Fu Kenny,This guy is way too arrogant. He knows nothing will happen from this. @Patience Moeti He is arrogant because he knows nothing will happen. @lesley klinck Sadly this is South Africa. People vote corruption in then ask why South Africa is burning. He is literally smiling with a smug face. "@Stronger together If a country intervenes then other countrys say it's ""racist""." Do away with BEE. It's not only minorities that suffer. The only people who benefit from BEE are people who are family members of politicians.
Kevin Muswede,"This guy is of no use man
Diana Sekatane,lying through his teeth.
