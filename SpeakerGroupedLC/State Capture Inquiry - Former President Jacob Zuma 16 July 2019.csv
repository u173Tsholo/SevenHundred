Azola Majali,heeheehee!!! thixo wase gorge town... is he being serious?
Keegan Pillay,Zondo. #DestroyerOfDataBundle Zondo you don't need to take 10 minutes on something that could be said in less than 30 seconds! "Hurry up Zondo "I did a calculation its clear that Zuma lawyers are concerned that he might say something incriminating. Its allowed legally but I must say reduces Zuma credibility
Dominic Przybylski,How many people have a bunker in their private home paid for by the state. What threats have been made? If he drinks a little less he won't have to irrigate the toilet as much. JZ spent 200 times more than De Klerk for security at his private residence despite there being no more armed struggle. Zuma gave far more to Guptas than he gave to education. BTW the taxpayers gave free education. @Stanley Pitse HIDE CHAT They going to waste as much time as possible so that the commission can only ask one question per hour. Zondo is a superb diplomat. "We all know that JZ will do anything to avoid his ""day in court."" It's only a liar who feels threatened by cross-examination." "@Moses Ntuli Tea break and discussion between Zondo Problem JZ's lawyers have is that he doesn't understand what is corrupt and what is not. "I think we need a robot as president. It will be able to read faster than any other president @Vuyiseka Rintsana Resumes at 12. Lawyers are privately in chambers with Zondo. I want a fully automated political party run by computers which will be incorruptable unless there's a technical bug which can be easily fixed. Humans are too prone to corruption. Only things to be revealed by cross-examination is lies. Surely our ex-president doesn't lie? "@Ryan Smith South Africans need to lead themselves personally The only real monopolies are in public sector(black monopoly capital); SOE's and municipalities. There is no law which prevents competition in private sector. @Talent P Sibisi White people believe in capitalism (which creates wealth) others believe in communism which creates nothing. @Talent P Sibisi I feel sad for you if you identify yourself and me by the colour of our skin. I identify myself by other more important personal attributes. I believe in individuality not race. "@Talent P Sibisi I suggest you get a personal identity Zondo is always late from his tea breaks. Personally I'm surprised JZ was here on time. He usually arrives a few hours late. @makumbi k2 All politicians are fake. "Somebody is guilty of perjury. Maseko Is Chabane still alive? Will/has he been on the stand? If it was in her evidence surely he would have checked his records? Top 6 were not consulted on his last reshuffle.

Judge Zonda is the best. he has a special way of working. people block the user Yos Human. he is just a trouble maker against all. Musa so must the Zulu then. look back in history. dont just look at one part of it. would it not be nice if we could have a chat like this without. you whites did this and that. and you blacks did this and that. and focus on the reason for this enquiry. it is to save SA and build SA keep the chat clean. non racial and focus on the enquiry. out of order comments will lead you users been blocked from the chat.

saywhat?,Pretorius is a sitting duck. Treating the witness with kid gloves. He cannot get a straight answer from Zuma. Never heard such cross - examining. What next? In all fairness - give him a magnifying glass so that he can make out the small writing - otherwise how will he defend himself? All these rudimentary questions that don't serve any purpose at all. He is giving Pretorius the run around He cannot answer on questions that relate to telephone calls or meetings that he did not attend. "No direct questions are being asked "All the questions that are being asked of him "As far as the fact that he did not file any affidavits "Nothing was put on paper I think this is the worst type of questioning that has been done since the start of the commission.
