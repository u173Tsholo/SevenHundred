JZ spent 200 times more than De Klerk for security at his private residence despite there being no more armed struggle. Zuma gave far more to Guptas than he gave to education. BTW the taxpayers gave free education. @Stanley Pitse HIDE CHAT They going to waste as much time as possible so that the commission can only ask one question per hour. Zondo is a superb diplomat. "We all know that JZ will do anything to avoid his ""day in court."" It's only a liar who feels threatened by cross-examination." "@Moses Ntuli Tea break and discussion between Zondo Problem JZ's lawyers have is that he doesn't understand what is corrupt and what is not. "I think we need a robot as president. It will be able to read faster than any other president @Vuyiseka Rintsana Resumes at 12. Lawyers are privately in chambers with Zondo. I want a fully automated political party run by computers which will be incorruptable unless there's a technical bug which can be easily fixed. Humans are too prone to corruption.

Nxamalala my leader bathathe baba abakwazi bakuzwa ngendaba. "Yes boss you are there to protect him We are not going to allow this to happen. We are very much aware of what Europe is doing in this country. "The background given yesterday was revealed for this type of attitude from Pretorious We know that this commission is set up to destroy my leader it is evident enough. Nxamalala is going no where. Zondo must not play games here. Yes he is the president on point. Maseko must bring his evidence with his stupid grievance with Chabane. we don't need these puppies of commission. Mr Zondo man up baba. You don't bring up people to be treated unfair or rather be subjected to some of interrogation without him knowing. Zuma must speak and destroy the African National Congress we will stand with him period. We are willing to get into civil war don't be mislead and mark my words. Zuma is our president. Pretorious is nonsensical period. Zondo man up baba and chair. "Zuma will not go anywhere that is the fact Pretorious don't think we are fools.

kabelo matthews,Zuma is now incriminating and in his dealings with guptas I don't think he understands where his statements will leave him if guptas are being assisted in setting up business by mr Zuma why are other ANC folks not helped in the same way or are they? now we see the tactics being used by Zuma and his lawyers. there are no witnesses who can confirm anything. Joe nhlanhla Collins chebane and now guptas none of them are available. so guptas ran away
Mthuthuzeli Ntlanyana,loooll zuma jhiooooooooo private today Pretorius vs Zuma...5-0 Pretorius must forgive him shame
Sylvester Finger,Zuma can't understand simple English "if GCIS was reporting to the President office Zuma remembers everything that was done to him but not what he did to give the Guptas RSA how can whoever who's plotting to get rid of Zuma fail for 29 years and then succeed now? what's Zuma saying now?🤔🤔🤔 @Llewellen46 because Zuma's dumb Zuma's counsel can see that he's going to spill the beans😂😂😂 the commissioner is asking questions according to the ToRs
Wildthing,already stuck he just linked himself to a crime wait until they bring out voice recordings. then it will all change now he is very stuck what he says now will come back and bite him in the ass when the move to removing the Finance Minister. spamming users will be removed. Take note Records will show otherwise. is this not the guy that already lost some cases for Zuma All they asking for is the truth. Judge Zonda will put him in his place very soon. Judge will treat him just like the lawyer on Friday. I override you please sit down. why does he not want to answer. too much to hide. Judge Zonda is the best. he has a special way of working. people block the user Yos Human. he is just a trouble maker against all. Musa so must the Zulu then. look back in history. dont just look at one part of it. would it not be nice if we could have a chat like this without. you whites did this and that. and you blacks did this and that. and focus on the reason for this enquiry. it is to save SA and build SA keep the chat clean. non racial and focus on the enquiry. out of order comments will lead you users been blocked from the chat. Respect each other. block Yose human now we move closer to how the Minister of Finance was removed on a week end. Moses block and report him by clicking on his icon

simba lloyd,zuma appears dull but trust me he is smart does the commission have evidence or its relying on hearsay evidence the commission wants to put words in Zuma's mouth the advocate seems confused as well where are the guptaz to answer for themselves why does zuma have to answer questions which need answers from theGuptaz or maseko Zuma besides being a President at that time he also had a private life like any other south african the prosecutor is useless if zuma is to give full information the whole commission is corrupt including zondo himself zuma is laying low otherwise many peope will be implicated if other presidents had relations with guptars then whats wrong with zuma Its just being unethical remember the states secrets act there things zuma cant say which pertain to the office of president one cant remember everything The problem with people is you mix politicsand administartion zuma prosecutor is mad whether you like it or not zuma is smart dont hate zuma hate the political mafias in south africa zuma is zuma is smart the commission should not act like witnesses themselves do you youself remember your call resgister and calls you made last year how many of you here remember calls you made a month ago remembering a person or an event is different from remembering a phone call pretorious must ask relevant questions and lead properly The commission is captured yes the prosecutor must bring the guptas what if maseko is lying about the guptas zuma lawyers are not protective but they should stick to the terms of reference of the inquiry Law is Law its not simple just to prosecute the law is in the book corroboration of gupta and maseko legal position needed Lets stick to the law not pages of maseko zondo knows he is in a fix now zondo is calm becasue he knows the agenda of their commission dont use feelings but use the lawhat does the law say there are rules in this game follow rules and not emotions zuma was called and was not sereved process on time people you should understand the law and the rules of the commission lawyer is not complaining but making a point Pretorious wants guidance Pretorious needs legal clientel @funicanz correct The commission is going to make a political decision in this case Zuma should be afforded an opportunity like other ministers what is unfair is other ministers were notified and given statements on time The lawyer is on point There is need for fairness transparency and justice for Zuma Governing a country and a home is different Lawyer is not wasting time but seeking wat is right for his client What happens in government is different from what happens in our homes or supermarkets zondo can tell where this is ging lawyer knows wha he is doing so tell me guys who is not corrupt in governmetn now ryan smith are you sure

Born free,Zuma an evasive witness Zulus are lazy The advocate will trip Zuma up.. on his lies. What he did as a President was to enrich himself.. expand his family and wives and Nkandla and his Swiss Bank account. Other than that he made no decisions. Zuma needs a Heimlich Manoeuvre Zumas lawyers are using delaying tactics Mr Pretorius has to break down the clarity questions into simplified ones because Zuma is unable to answer quickly. Credibility.. this enquiry is to establish the facts and truth.

Sukoma Holding,very strong lawyer I want this lawyer in my next crime. "Lawyers lawyers and Lawyers
saywhat?,Pretorius is a sitting duck. Treating the witness with kid gloves. He cannot get a straight answer from Zuma. Never heard such cross - examining. What next? In all fairness - give him a magnifying glass so that he can make out the small writing - otherwise how will he defend himself? All these rudimentary questions that don't serve any purpose at all. He is giving Pretorius the run around He cannot answer on questions that relate to telephone calls or meetings that he did not attend. "No direct questions are being asked "All the questions that are being asked of him "As far as the fact that he did not file any affidavits "Nothing was put on paper I think this is the worst type of questioning that has been done since the start of the commission. Answer with NANDOS I'm feeling sorry for Pretorius!
