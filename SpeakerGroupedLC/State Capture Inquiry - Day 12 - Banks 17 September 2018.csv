MrMoyoT,"Not to bust anyone's bubble How? They will just show some bank statements nje. Im telling you it wont go anywhere. No one will be arrested or charged. Its a just a show to garner votes for 2019 elections Its a network of transactions that will implicate the banks themselves. There are vested interests to protect the real perpetrators of state capture which is white monopoly capital Guptas are just small fish whom they want to throw under the bus. Which will not happen. This is just Generations or Uzalo with a well written script. They are all actors Jonathan you know very well what that is. People dont yet realize that Guptas are being all used to cover up the real mess behind the rot in govt. All the big white owned firms have done much worse than what this fake commission is trying to fool us into believing jonathan look at the bigger picture Closing of accounts is just a front or a ruse jonathan why just focus on guptas and not other white companies as well look how they play victim and point fingers to zuma and his indian cronies. the commision is just a farce until it addresses the real state capture Jonathan you act naive Robert how so You think this kangaroo commission will achieve anything More of our money down the drain Monique here are some facts for you "the country’s only black-owned bank these are white owned and controled the financial sector contributes 22.2% to gross domestic productand controls assets worth about R4.8-trillion. meaning that R4.4trillion of that money is in white hands "Of the R1-trillion in cash hoarded by corporates at white-owned banks "Of the R5.8-trillion private property (excludes agrarian and commercial land) value in South Africa im answering your question with evidence
Siyabonga Nxumalo,Waste of time South Africa has always been about race. Don't come here and act DUMB.
Edward Buta,"@noko No one

Jonathan Palivili,Mr Moyo T... kindly explain what is white monopoly capital "I dont know.. Its all about race NOW ??/... so im bit confused as to how white monopoly capital affected the closing up the Gupta related accounts Yes thats what you need to explain .. you are answering in riddles ? "even if that is so  "Please note Mr Moyo that the banks have not closed any other companies accounts  MR Moyo its because of NO OTHER companies robbing our SOEs and our hard earned tax moneys and did not know how to account for the stolen money Mr Moyo Mr Moyo.. you call me naive... All im asking you can you explain which white monoplly capital is involved with money laundering with our banks... hope the ordinary man in the street blacks open their eyes and vote with their hearts in 2019... You have been ripped off BIG TIME by the government... Thando ... How can that be racist... 4 babies died in hospital because of lack of additional hospitals.. Where has all the monies gone to? Thando... I have many black friends living in shacks and without food... Do you not care for them???
Robert Russell,5 Minutes into the broadcast and the race card starts.... so sad... The Banks are public listed companies... go and invest your black money in them and then you can own them @MrMoyoT ....and I'm afraid to say you are very doff "@Monique Jones ... VBS was looted from the inside Billions @peter pott ....you starting to sound lie ZUMA 😃 ANC thieves...always lurking in the back ground to feed Chancellor House Who gave the ANC at Lootfreely house the instruction to get involved????? "@David Rocha ... ZUMA pops up AGAIN
Monique Jones,@Jonathan Palivili WMC is whatever Bell Pottinger told them it was. @Siyabonga Nxumalo now the whole world is about race. From Europe to America to SA to S. America @MrMoyoT What is state capture? Who is captured? Who is corrupt? What do we do with the corrupt? How do we ensure jobs for everyone and free education for all youth? Who's in charge? @MrMoyoT Specifics please and not generalities. @Thando Nkutha just skip over our lonnnnngggggggg esssaaaayyyyyyysssss please @Thando Nkutha great idea!

Give me 1 or 2 word answers like @Thando Nkutha wants I'm going to ask these questions in the sincerest way. @MrMoyoT are any black people in govt/private sector corrupt? Have they made millions from the state? @MrMoyoT if I see any person in government living high off the hog while any black South African lives in squatter settlements and hungry then I have a BIG problem with corruption. @Thando Nkutha shhh we're listening @Thando Nkutha lol @Siyabonga Sihle he's a lie-awyer @Thando Nkutha have you been penalized for early withdrawal? Get off the sex talk! Nice chatting with y'all. @MrMoyoT still hasn't answered my inquiries. Almost 4am here and I'm going back to sleep. Hopefully.

Nelson Musoliwa,Systematized racism is half indoctrination and it is difficult to undo indoctrination. Economic endeavors knows no race. Bank legal team line of operation is of legal nature so evidence before the team directs whether to consult the affected client or not
Sanele B.,@MrMoyoT That's true Sir.
Nomthetho Nokwakha,"let each president give each other space to make impact in society "you can't capture woman "the problem is mind set

Lorna Kavanagh,just as well Standard Fnb Absa and Nedbank are in responsible hands or else they wouldd be looted .... money destined for Estina went to ..... DUBAI. the banks have to protect their interests seeing it is their client's money is at risk ....
abel brown,so all the banks did the same things so they was definetly something dodgy zwane was so arrogant in saying that @ thando europeans and land so out of topic here pls focus on the matter at hand
cecil thurston vanreenen,I agree there was collusion how can you close a account without asking the client to explain Pravin Gordan has his hands in this desions there you go!!! there was collusion they followed absa "the guptas is a cover up for the real crime committed by the ophenimers and the rupert's  the new sherriff still have the old constables
Siyabonga Sihle,so interesting to hear this nice questio from Zondo you can seen in his face that he is lying @Monique Jones 😂😂 "Dep Judge said can you summaries without reading 😯😂 but look at Willia

Sindiswa Moolman,The gossip supported what they picked internally @peter pott
Gaone Molefe,"so he is giving merits to the deformation of character case that might be opened incase they are not guilty with all charges
Linda Damons,the guy is nervous coz he has to spill the beans..... "@reboane i read somewhere that the gupta also messed up in canada
Isaac Patsa,Why was the ANC seeking to address the banks on this matter. If i have the same problems will they do the same considering that i have voted for them since 1994.
Holy Cannabis Oil,Hello Everyone...
Thiza William,@ Peter Pott Mutlichoice or tiger brands never stole from blacks but Guptas have left us with gapping hole in our fiscus...stealing from tax payers without investing anything crime is crime no amount of justification can provide human face to a criminal conduct "inquiry its not about racism As a black man I feel ashamed to have been duped by some foreigners who came in using race division to steal from a black race with an assistance of willing black Askaris I don't care if its small or big as long as we arrested and recover what has been looted period! @ Peter Pott I have been long enough in Africa to know difference between false prophecy and truth. Probably you're amongst people that believe in moracles I refused to be duped by criminals that insults blacks by stealing and blame whites "Malema owns a multi million mansion You send a wolf to guard sheeps and pretend not to know when sheeps go missing "Malema! Was he not the one to be bailed out by Mazzotti a white man @ Peter history is littered with such investments in particular South Africans. Do you think Zuma woke up one morning to defraud the fiscus?
peet Petersen,"This person got his facts in line and slowly unravel the mission and modus operandi.

Norman Zwane,give up = let go maybe that's why they are friends; they think alike aka Birds of a feather.... @Phillo Beukes Read that Afriforu document with Thembeka Ngcukaithobi's book THE LAND IS OURS @Phillo Beukes: Ngcukaithobi's research is based on SA Law Reports (cases decided in SA courts). The Afriforum document is based on deeds signed by illeterate chiefs and whites (very legit???)

SA must take the lead This is a big story SA your banks were robbed It sounds like big big money "Gold "Shares swaps @peet Petersen sounds like money well beyond what I will ever see in this life "They trade controlling shares Money has no color Greedy is not a race Thief is not a color
makhosi nobhatyi,"We must accept that former president was enriched himself and family and friends called Gupta @peet peter am shocked to hear this especially Zwane was confidence to defend Guptas nowonder wat he is going to say Is former president around the country? Thieves is thieves no color what is hurting most is our own leader who compare himself as champion of the poor but stealing from poor "Nothing about ANC 
nkosinathi mathenjwa,when will duduzani gupta 😂😂 cross examine
Mzwandile Ntombela,when they say they can't remember who said what
Mudzanani Orries,Those who became part and parcel of state capture must be prosecuted to give the special lesson to others who are intending to do such. Poor people are Suffering but their Taxes are misused
jose billa,corruption at its best level...
Melvict Melbourne,"Thando $50 say not one of these ANC ministers or Gwede will end up in jail. sheep is the voters that supported these thieves. @Thiza.. that were the cadres plan all along. If you think they struggled to stay poor...….. The masses were used and still don't realise that.
