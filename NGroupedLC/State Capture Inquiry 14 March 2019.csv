57:19,1:02:27, @Frik Brits. I think they are lazy to do the job. @Frik Brits I just wanna weep when I remember how many losses I suffered before a very impatient commissioner who did not tolerate poorly paginated bundles.

1:05:43,1:10:22, @Nkululeko Zondo ....agree 100% I have to visit my brother DCJ Zondo tomorrow late and ask him when is this commission will be completed we cant be glued on this commission for all the time with no ending. Also we want Big fishes "@Norman Zwane  There is a hairstyle that is grabbing my attention. Guess which? We need Agrizzis on this commission not people who were just runners with no power Cassius.. The president is not obliged to keep people who are heavily tainted in corruption for a longer period You catch the big fish when the small ones clump together... The big fish would otherwise eat the little ones. "@thabani matthews - In fact this guy is lying. I mean "Maleka is having a tough time leading this guy. This Dr Ramontja has got Woolies ""free-range"" chicken tendencies. Ufuna ukuyekwa anhlanhlathe nje!!! Hayi uyabhora." 
1:10:38,1:15:08, This branches are corrupt as well- why choose a thief @Cassius Mngomezulu else its speak to our President being controlled and being a week Leader. Is this the new dawn we were promised? Thatha Maleka - this guy is lying too much He might just get the 3rg degree treated like a hostile witness. "I don't no.... eish @Stephan Dolk what was all that expensive education for if all you become ia red post box? This guy doesn't come across as a high ranking individual at DG level. Bulisa Nkosini ungena sihleli sisebandla @Thando Nkutha 
1:15:29,1:19:05, @Cassius Mngomezulu how do you guarantee such? If the power is with the branches then once he start reshuffling they will recall him and out number him. They will fire him just like Mbeki and Zuma zondo is stuffing this up for the lawyer Guys don't worry all corrupt individuals will become back benchers "@Thando Nkutha Dr Ramontja is no book E Nkosini! "@ Nkululeko "So this guys Dr Ramontja was not responsible for anything? Just taking orders and sign everything ? Post Office is this guy No wonder he was even left behind and his subordinate was taken overseas. Even Maleka asked why such an important project like Optimum will not involve him. "With all his qualifications and experience 
1:19:39,1:21:59, pathetic indeed @Nkululeko Zondo- aGREEEEEEE 120% "lol! you got to love how the mafia operates I'm government. ""don't ask questions "@Nkululeko Then how do we hire such poeple like Dr Ramontja in such positions? So pathetic. Where is he working now or what does he do? "I'm finding it hard to understand this guy "up to now he hasnt added any value to the commission "@Eslon Eslon i can only hope so "@zondo

Hayi amakhisikazi ayakwazi ukubekezela bakithi! 😂😂😂😂 It really saddens me that all the guys we looked up to being Black excellence were mostly used by less educated guys in corruption and got implicated. I believe all are greedy and benefited. "@Cassia mgomezulu 
1:26:05,1:29:11, "@zwane Lazy to read @Thando Nkutha "@ Nkululeko He was busy reading bona magazine and forget to verify any document he is signing "@Thando Nkutha Ugogo uNaMabuza wayethi uma efuna ukubamba ugcekeni "Nkululeko "@carnoth ngomane true than Koko acted as the Don of the mafiaoso "I said hai 
1:29:30,1:32:06, @Thando Nkutha. I can assure you now. Ppl are lazy to read those small letters that says T&C right at the bottom of the page. That is where the secrete lies. 😂😂hai this Dr was scammed "@ Nkululeko All the minions had to step in line and obey instructions from Zuma and the Guptas young people where are you "I said chili..""😀😀😀😀it's tough today DG." "@Eslon Eslon yes for you to be a Pres and successful in business you gotta be smart His argument is pointless because if he was concerned about it all he would first find out who drafted the letter before signing it. "thought hes said Zwane centralised everything 
1:32:10,1:35:51, "For a ""Dr' this dude is talking in circles patting himself on the back!" @peter pott Tjo! Those are expensive pecks. I guess in theses economic times its worth suffering otherwise in order to access these perks. It seems that they wanted to create 'fall guy's...in essence 'patsys' Typical mafia modus operandi The gentlemen is cornered already....😂😂😂😂😂 "Aowa this Dr wasn't running that department True i wonder what criterion was used to hire this guy as a DG Haha The letter just appeared in his out tray... he signs it 
1:36:21,1:40:22, @Thando Nkutha. Exactly and that is where you get caught. ... and just disappeared from his office. The day Koko testify should be explosive he has a LOT to account for @Neil Fraser who does that in his rightful mind. This Dr must open up and tell the truth. "leave the dg alone he was just caught in gupta corruption network People were manipulated according to their character flaws @Sfiso Nkosi Or lets agree it was a error of judgement. There’s obviously some deeper sinister activities within the department. @Tobo exactly so many people were used and abused...it was capture strategy "you dont know who brought the letterto yuor attention 
1:40:45,1:44:46, The psycho dynamics of state capture is thesis material When cornered lies and lies all starts.....give his Dr some water focus on zwane and koko "Truth always have weight "I’ve solved it ...Maybe the cleaners wrote the letter "All you criticising the Dr have clearly never been in compromising situations. It doesn't matter how meticulous you are in your demeanour NO answer. @Tsepang Ranneileng that can only happened if they have something against you. NO such thing. You forgot to put the date then you caught up with something!!! how possible is that 
1:44:48,1:46:42, "He who feeds you @Tsepang...it happened to me once and I flatly refused to sign and made myself very unpopular as the 'troublemaker' and 'too clever for and it takes the slightest blip for you to get compromised and inevitably become the scapegoat. We are all human after all. This guy has an impeccable service record! give him a break! @Desmond Masilela 😂😂😂it doesn't make sense Wake up South Africa not one single guilty person will ever go to jail while ANC is in control. This is a farce. ✊🏿eff I saw many people being used...tragic Impossible...he remembers very everything but that wants to prove his non-involvement in this. If you were not part of the game you will spill the beans. He’s lying this one😡how do you sign a letter you are not satisfied with VBS BANK DID FFLYD GO TO JAIL 
1:46:53,1:49:37, Then uses “hindsight” what a chop. Stop lying to us you fool. Nxa! "@Sfiso Nkosi It doesnt make sence at all. You dont know where the letter come from We will nationalise and expropriate VBS bank so it doesn’t matter about jail or the 2IC He should have acknowledged his error of judgement first up. Better late than none. @Thando Nkutha. He accept the wrong doing but that will let him in trouble trust me. "Only those who have never been in a highly charged high level working environment criticise Welcome back to Top 10 comment we will back soon although chat style has change to control this channel we will never give up effing liar. he was owned a just did what he is told. Really @Magda.? That’s a huge assumption 
1:49:52,1:53:14, Not one single guilty corrupt cadre will ever go to jail while anc in power ✊🏿eff "Adv Maleka will probe him on this letter as he wants him to deny it they should ask him what he wanted to revisit? that should be revealing tea break? @Thando Nkutha. The man knew what was going on. believe me. @Magda I'm fully with you on this one I will never rest in my lifetime until the anc and it’s corrupt people is hanged ✊🏿eff is coming in May 19 Hindsight.... "The moral decay in the ANC government is sickening! no regard for ethics whatsoever! I've been in government before 
1:55:50,2:08:20, "@Thando Nkutha. Then he should say so Wat is this about? @Neil...really...Read the book called Snakes in Suits a d you will be enlightened what us the difference between ANC and EFF when it comes to corruption. who lead the demise of Limpopo and VBS? in fact eff will be worse. Dr's voice is now toned down!! This guy he acted as if his hand are clean but i can see his hand are dirty Corruption is corruption irrespective who is doing it Is there anything that this Dr was sure of or something that he was fully aware of in that department? Something are not correct but you could not figure that out by then. You should have question this before. 
2:08:38,2:10:56, "Viva ""SA State of Inquiry"" should have to come here in TZ." He got his share and now his trying so hard to act clean. if we dig deeper there are skeleton around Dr. that's just my 2cent He was heading of DMR during the Zwane Ppl just go study for the sake of ripping us. @Yin Yang PhD and MSc (Eng) degrees from the University of the Witswatersrand and a BSc (Hons) in Geology and Soil Science from the then University of the North. Sometimes people who are more educated they are not a clever as we may think. is he an honorary Dr? This guy is not telling the truth. "@Singi Mathebula No 
2:11:09,2:13:16, Now is like he was brainwashed? Valuable lesson for the youth...your signature is sacrosanct "just came from sabc livestream the problem with people from university in the work place is they feel their job is done so they just sit there there's no drive companies want people with drive @Ann M. not convincing! @Magda Seguin As is your name. Once your reputation is muddied it's very hard to clean. "We can speculate whether his hands are soiled or clean He left the department during Zwane i know him better Well done Chairperson. It was not just any letter. 
2:13:55,2:15:14, surprise surprise cANCer causes corruption Hi guys..did Van Rooyen granted leave t question....I mic it out earlier on Nkosi! This Dr I could have locked up If was Judge because his justification straight shows was given dividend. he has been granted Abel was this guy appointed because he had what it takes for the job or it was jobs for friends ? "Correct He is hidding something Very forgetful as soon as things get hot neh "Then its simple

It's not his fault he looks like the younger brother of ACE the thief... tnx J..nd I assume he will be cross examine as well is this prosecutor laughing or unjalo nje? Corruption to our continent.. wooo. Can not explain. "Yes he will bring his own version This guy VERY scared @Thando Nkutha.
