time,8:38,message Save the nation from the hyenas and stealing from the public purse. Vote DA What about Zuma and Magashule they are out there campaigning as if they have done nothing wrong. my big X is nxt t d DA too vote ANC ❎ What is frightening is that these hyenas and public purse stealers have no guilt. All the polls show a shrinking DA support in these elections. DA ❎ i wonder how long is this state capture is going to take 
8:50,14:00, These investigations into State Capture will become dormant again if the ANC win the elections. ANC have had 25 years to deliver on their policies. Time has run out. U vote DA U VOTE For Steihuizen for President It took you 5000 years to oppress blacks i looking forward to vote for EFF i doubt that DA agree with your view of apartheid flag "It doesn't matter what Zondo does and he will do his job well VOTED ALREADY FOR THEE ANC Save The Nation From The Hyenas that steal from the public purse.. Vote DA 
14:06,17:32, @tshepho molepa DA is an offspring of that flag and what it stands for so they wont mind "tjoo so fast-no one is arrested yet @psyfrequency Techno- YOU LOVE MY NAME NE @carnoth i get you lol. Save The Nation From The Hyenas That Steal From The Public Purse. Vote DA pat de Lille is dealing nicely with the DA in the Western Cape "Maimane will will be removed from DA watch the space "@Val Spiers i want to see fast changes n by EFF we will b covered. 
18:05,19:25, This advocate is out of depth "@Cassius Mngomezulu you are correct hence they brought Tony Leon to help with the election campaign "you said the same thing about Maimane being removed in 2016 too Zondo is satisfied with the evidence leader it seems Kay Kay.. yes you are correct. His only a recruiter after all the few blacks give them votes his gone @psyfrequency Techno a less confident person keeps repeating himself Let us VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAl @Kay Kay All ANC members are called upon to campaign for a decisive victory of the people's movement. 
19:31,24:25, Let us VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL ANC FOR LIFE Let us VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL... If you vote ANC then you must vote for Ramophosa because you do not want the State deputy President David Mabuza as President.. he has a muddied past. Infact most of the ANC has a muddied past and present ANC will rule till jesus krest comes like it or not 👣✊ still better than EFF Yes the ANC is better than the EFF but the DA is the best. Techno u need to learn more abt our history as black child 
24:50,29:51, @Val Speirs Yes you are correct DA is the best for the white minority This Booysen fella is very intelligent @techno ask who ever give you that flag about blacks They will have to wait another 25 years beki Cele! @Techno your racist attitude wont help DA to win elections tnx Manzi "Bheki Cele Richard Mdluli was dangerous creature 
30:38,36:30, @techno then speak like you want change the country stop blaming like Musi Maimane Booysen is now dropping heavy bombshells If Infrastructure is built it then gets vandalised and set on fire by protestors so how do you win? @techno the problem is you don’t lesson to the black President of the country corruption isn't a mistake it's a conscious decision United the ANC Hyenas stand and United they must fall @techno I’ll engage you after you remove the flag of blood @techno died doing what Did I hear the name Karima Brown? 
36:34,44:13, @manzi what flag are you talking about? More blood has been shed under the current flag fyi Yes they conspired to remove Mbeki with the assistance of Julius Malema who was very involved in State Capture in the Limpopo province. @techno tel me about the flag especially colours are symbolizing what this flag nonesense comes out just before an election just to stoke cultural Marxism to keep everything racialized and that's the only way the ANC stays in power by making everything racial "@Val Speirs state capture I felt sorry for Phiyega when I thought she was being made a scapegoat regarding the Marikana tragedy but now I think I'm taking my sorry back. let's face it malema was zumas right hand and turned on him when he was denied a bigger piece of the pie "@Kapn Krunk 
44:35,54:08, kapn politics are other things "The right and moral thing the ANC can do is to completely disband and begin from scratch...but they will never do that...there isn't a single honest bone in their entire body...no morals General Booysen is really speaning the bean today "@Pheladi Lamola Malema R Ndluli should have already serving his prison term if law enforcement agencies were not captured by zuma 'sstooges @psyfrequency Techno It blows my mind how any rational human being can actually defend and support parties like the ANC ... Stockholm Syndrome is big here in SA Malema has also been under investigation and still is but these cases went dormant hence this testimony from Booysen. Stockholm syndrome: a condition which causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity. Sums up ANC supporters pretty well id say 
54:12,56:32, "@Nelson Musoliwa "Let him spill the beans  Of all the ANC candidates I would say Cyril Ramophosa is the only way forward for the ANC.
