27:45,41:02, Let the truth come out we are rebuilding the ANC Osama of corruption Musa Bakiti​Osama of corruption-😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😁😂 @Phillip Moshapo Pull the other one - it has bells on it. Mr President promised us that those were implicated at Zondo commission will go to jail @Derek Main....Phillip is right..... the ANC are rebuilding....with stolen bricks... "@Bridgette Kekana ...If you believe the president Mr President free our king now Well done ANC although i wished victory for EFF 
41:26,50:09, "i know the election is over but is it realy over or are there a agenda that will start soon Tears of a Lion "@Luvuyo Zantsi i thought the election chapter was closed now it seems that the anc voters are keeping a fraudelent party in power for fear of the emnarresment that this said fraudelant anc party wil be in the public scrutany @Luvuyo Zantsi I don't mind how the 'natives' voted - I'm more concerned about the fools. not this again @Carnoth Ngomane Unfortunately the majority of SAfns have voted for more of the same. They obviously can't rub 2 brain cells together. @Thando Nkutha I Zondo has health issues... his breathing and coughs don't sound normal pls the wrongdoers must go to jail like Nomvula Ace Supra n the rest list is endless we need clean governance 
50:18,53:57, @Luvuyo Zantsi Somebody has to think for you. AA kept the corupteers in busness and so they must in a serious effort keep the defaulters in place if they should loose it will be losing face as in japanese culture close to suicide @Luvuyo Zantsi It's more surprising that someone has to tell you not to vote for thieves. "@Derek Main you cant change the inevitable @Carnoth Ngomane Why? Are you embarrassed? oak has a cool beard man. "@Thando Nkutha A friend who does IT at the commission told me they asked him to switch off the mic when not talking we will take to the street we are no more fools or they must pay back the money anybody wanna buy some shortbread? 
54:40,57:26, do you have biscuits R5 for a dope cookie boss eat first pay later ? @Luvuyo Zantsi Not even a 'baas' can force you to think for yourself. "@Derek Main not at all here's a taste chief 🍪 Guys are you aware that Indians(Guptas alike) are in the middle of every thing in SA @Carnoth Ngomane And we live with the consequences. I am going to continue to remind the fool ANC voters of this each time we hear of more ANC corruption. @Cassius Mngomezulu yea seems their fingerprins are all over 
57:42,1:06:39, @Luvuyo Zantsi To vote for thieves is to be a fool. is it because he's fat? where's my safe space this fat shamming is triggering... @Luvuyo Zantsi To protest against poor service delivery one day and vote for the very party that is not delivering is to be a fool. The final cost of looting ?? Trillions lost to the economy ofSA. @Luvuyo Zantsi I would have been happy for them just to think. Solve first the xenophobic problems in South Africa.a country without a neighbor it doesn’t exist @Luvuyo Zantsi How much further does the ANC have to drag SA down before the ANC voters realise the error of their ways? @Derek Main ...heres a clue.... VENEZ........ you fill in the dots 
1:12:58,1:20:07, Xenophobia? @KasambiBategeka.... you mean we xenophobic? "@Derek...i wouldn't have thought SA could go any further down "@KASAMBI BATEHEKA A Point to ponder...... retirement funds amounts to something like 2 trillion rands in the kitty..invested locally... Watch The ANC amend the constitution to attach that... Run folks .dont walk. Run @barbara broadbent Never underestimate the criminality of the ANC. "Thank you Fellow South Africans for voting liberation movement @makhosi nobhatyi SA needs to be liberated from the liberators turned plunderers. "I wouldn't dare do that Derek 
1:20:26,1:26:22, they have no shame either!! Nope - brazen plunder. Corrupt to the core. from R9million(not exceeding) to exceeding R280millions😓😓 how does anyone justify this blatant theft? "@ Derek main ANC is the party for all people @Granny Mokwena Ask the ANC - they will have some spin or other. @makhosi nobhatyi Not possible for the ANC - they're corrupt to the core. Remember my words a year down the line when we have slipped even further under the thieves. a business case cannot be a one man show.. 
1:27:18,1:31:02, "@Derek main as president said change is painful and hard to accept @Granny Mokwena meaning R271m went to waste? The ANC will keep this commission going for 5 years so that Jelly Fish Ramafaker does not have to act on his comrats @Felix Muyoba Exactly - yet the voters still cling to the fantasy that one man can turn everything around. Even though he was silent as DP when all this corruption continue. inquiries in South Africa is just waist of time. since time is money @Robert Russell that is so true "Dilip Badal  Wait till we see who is on the list for parliament.... none of the crooks from the Zuma/Ace faction will be removed... just wait....and see the business case was overstated to justify the looting 
1:32:12,1:44:55, Look guys here what ever comes out here is binding i was listening to Ace Magashule saying saying commission findings are not binding which he shows they may defiance to show up to the commission The reason I say that is that CR only acts when a commission/inquiry makes a recommendation.... even the ANC ethics team are disregarded shows how deep the crooks are in-bedded in the ANC "NPA @makhosi nobhatyi We expect no different from the ANC. "@ Felix Muyoba I am serious about this You will see surprise next week when President announces his new cabinet can never trust a capitalist @makhosi nobhatyi ....yes we will be surprised when all the same crooks are in parliament... to demonstrate that CR is week.... surprise...surprise Jirre die mense kan steel... imagine if all the ingenuity employed to steal were to be spent for the benefit of the people... 
1:46:31,1:59:59, imagine if that nevfer hqappened greedy comrades got us here sadly just put people who know what they're doing there "@ Roberts Russell no he said publicly no one must be on the cabinet implicated Bathabile and Nomvula won’t be in government Lets all be back here on the 22nd of May and have a laugh..... Nomvula our leader and J G Zuma back in the list this fellow is very eloquent in his testimony let's them dance for what they voted for (poor for ever) 
2:04:14,2:22:08, @Felix Muyoba this guy is fasting and he cannot lie @makhosi nobhatyi Gwede Mantashe got security installed by Bosasa - how is he not implicated? Or is that just ANC spin? @Felix Muyoba very eloquent. he knows his story guess where the meeting was? @makhosi nobhatyi Your own integrity committee fingered Mantashe but we all know the ANC will ignore them. I don't know anything about tenders but he makes too much sense😂 Exactly @Derek Main.... if I was a crook.... I would want to be part of team ANC.... for sure So many people believed the EFF when they attacked Gordhan when he started cleaning up at PRASA.Since the testimonies started of what really happened they are quiet. where is Advocate Malika? 
2:23:25,2:29:52, "The theft is mind boggling @Musa Bakiti 😂😂 when is anoj yestifying The Durban Mayor was arrested (and rightfully so) for much less...it makes no sense that the masters of state capture including Zuma is still free Manoj will not testify unless he is subpoenaed The list of those who benefited from Dubai flights and Oberoi hotel stays was published yesterday...Koko is one of them...he is still very vocal on Twitter as if he is innocent @Magda Seguin Do you know when the inquiry is eventullu meant to wind up? I heard it was 2 years....i.e. 2021 You are correct @Robert Russell 
2:30:34,2:34:06, Thanks Robert. It's quite depressing listening at the ease how the state funds went down the drain. I like this man. he knows his story. please give him bells "The prosecution of those implicated will be concurrent Zizo jika izinto new dawn @Mike Moja i gave him the bells already And trust me Neil.... funds will keep diapering whilst the ANC are protecting their comrats "I sincerely pray and hope that NDZ or Dlamini don't get top positions in parliament @Felix Muyoba 💪🙏 "@Robert Russell - Agree. Nut we are only hearing about some of the ""big fish"". What about local municipalities 
2:34:18,2:39:24, here it comes open the flood gates woman had n opportunity t elect a woman as a deputy at Nasrec. Crodile tears. stupid "I was listening to the youth league this morning calling eThekwini mayor to step aside while NPA is investigating the corruption and fraud That i where the majority of theft takes place.... ask Ace.the thief ....@Neil Fraser "The PRASA board at the time are even worse than the Eskom board just finished reading the Gangster state. Depressing 😱 "PRASA has an enormous budget Guptas whistle blower is ready to testify
