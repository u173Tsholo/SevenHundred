time,-8:11,message End the anc. salaam infidels 🤣 Hi Quinton and HALO so i was right on Friday on why DCJ was keeping on about the guarantee etc cause he caught her in a lie and that laid the foundation for the rest of the time.. "fact remains - as a qualified lawyer and company secretary Greetings All .. What makes her story more airy fairy is that her Eskom title was Head: Legal & Compliance - why did she agree to that fancy title & salary if her role didn't extend to legal matters? hi Lerato Hallo my people 
-7:58,-4:58, Lerato remember when i said she was part of the legal team as she drafted papers etc..... hi marttha and bongile who is this minister who is coming today? hi Diane And did you see her reaction when Seleka told her about the radio into and where she was named as being Businessman???

-4:26,-2:42, "can anybody tell me please nope nope @Lerato Moleke - the evidence thus far does not suggest participation on her part - methinks she was simply in a job too big for her hi Teunis and sneakerhead and charlie I see news channels 403 and 405 are reporting that Khusela Diko husband has died except sabc 404.

3:07:40,3:09:34, Building their own fiefdoms! dcj is struggling with putting his words clearly across to witness writing a book Ethical matters are not of concern because they get in the way of the brown paper packets "@Heather Durr Very common these days is for politicians to talk about SA's sisuasion Nkandla costs millions of Rands but Nkandla residents does not have water and other services....they are extremely poor They were following Zuma that's exactly why we are here Zuma ran this country to the ground 🙄 "Governance Antie. Period "They would never say Zuma was wrong 
3:09:56,3:11:17, Never argue with someone who believes their own lies. Or trust them to lead. They all have dirt on each other that is why they don't talk! Fire all Corrupt Politicians @melds melds..... sad but true. @Lindwell Daniels we would not have a government ever under anyone Am getting tired of this MONTANA name ei 🤢🤮 they would never say anything cz they where scared of Zuma @charlie zamile Thats the problem with a chums and patronage network. South African politicians are corrupt moer 
3:11:29,3:12:34, WOW! that's a hot potato to leave burning through lunch!! ... why Cabinet sat by and watched the looting "These looters begin with making falsehood appear like truth Zondo is a gentle genius! @Lindwell Daniels sadly they are the ones who vote in the ANC they vote for thier own pain & suffering. I have no sympathy anymore. I have given up. Montana is buzy tweeting that zondo want to find zuma guilty @charlie dont feel sorry for him he put incompetent people there so he would not have any resistance .. it was all his doing and pre planned ! agree Be @Thabo Daniel :elbowcough: "Mama is going to run to the toilet at lunchtime .

NSC question papers leak Hope all those that voted for Zuma are happy I enjoy seeing Dipuo cornered. Today I am here the whole day. This is a cure to me.  ANC cadres definitely get lessons in giving long-winded answers to short questions to try & shift blame. At least they have one competence!! @dude cool Johan Rupert is also corrupt? Hows that? @Maritime Studies as they saying goes... every dog gets its day message

"the South African sangomas must come on board Why would a State President be interested in a temporary appointment in a SOE? Letsoayo 
12:43,16:23, yesterday it was the eyes All these Ministers never thought they would have to account for their deeds. Whilst in office they where a law upon themselves and no one dared question their actions That is EL you tell her short example haha Louis yes Ms Peters seems to be intently economical with the truth. Her truth is more scarce than the Vaccines at the moment. "No who's this one talking.? i mossed out 1 week Dipuo Peters 
16:30,18:44, How is the frustration of the board being referred to as a fact. Molefe is the one who assumed the board was frustrated. There's no evidence of such Ex Transport Minister what will happened will zoma go to jail ? "@Maritime Studies Wow malawi issues arrent warrant for bushiri after blocking daughters treatment abroad @Louis C Brilliant Bro. and Greetings too its a problem when old people are corrupt what are the young ones going to do "A representative of DOT at IMO is an Agency "All these politicians will only realizing their responsibility 
18:49,21:26, eskom warned its pricing itself out of the market *realise "Dipuo Well she is frustrating the truth and EL is getting hot under the collar 'You dont have to repeat them' lololololoilll The Zupta ANC can then join with their Youth League the EFF and become the Opposition. There we can see them for what they are. "This whole state Capture. is huge. Nearly every gov department its a proble when old people are corrupt what the young ones are going to do "@ louisC Yes 
21:42,26:15, "indicated  @Lorna Kavanagh It would be easier to approach that subject if we looked for who is not corrupt. I tried and could not find one department. The Young people in the ANC go to the Political School where the corrupt ANC old people will teach them the ANC way? cabinet is not a rubber stamp hello it is as the anc says what must be dealt and passed and what does not.. you statement is ridiculous @Louis C : These people can’t differentiate between the Government of the people of the Republic and their political party. They use a political card across the board @Maritime Studies there are many competent ex-SOE employees no longer employed because they wanted to do the right thing - they frustrated the corruption feeding I am sure that she is duly and genuinely accepting-she is deceitful and arrogant @Maritime Studies commiserations. let's hope that justice will prevail word salad now ma'am Peters 
26:32,29:36, So you have different processes within the process that start and finish Chairperson.... "Heather they are all arrogrant Wat was happening into your shoes at that time....? 'co-incided with my presence' How is that for not taking ownership @kevin w. I was suspended 3 times because I closed corruption in the Maritime Branch. I didn’t sign corrupt documents. I won all the cases. Two were under Dipuo Administration. Buti it was to tight and too high @Buti Sipho athletes foot..? "Women are Stronger & more Godlike than us men ..So family members of this woman 
31:02,32:49, Under her administration SAMSA from 2016 had no CEO. She left the status quo like that. To date SAMSA has no CEO. That’s why I say she destroyed the Maritime Sector. yes it was convenient not to have a gceo so that looting could continue @Maritime Studies - keep your head held high - what goes around will hopefully come around for these criminals "Like water off a duck's back If you digress any further you will fall off the face of the planet That was Zondo's way of telling her to choose her word carefully... LOL 😁😁😁😁😁😁 one that stood out now I remember and that is her telling DCJ get out of my face her memory is back chair... thank you! 
32:50,34:46, Chairperson let me digress a bit! What a joke! DCJ & Mr Soni - please pull her right back onto the question she is supposed to answer & don't allow her to ramble on! @O S Muzik. I concur Greed Greed Greed !! these states that's why gangs always let everyone share in the loot .. the only way to keep the cabal quiet ! cripple her ministry she did it herself' OH She has gone back to her notes.......

""are you willing to WORK WITH US if yes then we have ministry for you""" Please no longer story. Answer the question Back then it was important to seem like they had reason for their decisions.

"@OS Musik: You are right The same Molefe who has not even finished testifying..  after the concourt decision there were rumours that the commission could recall her and that she has to answer the questions Minister they wanted you to say Zuma prevented the process of appointing the group CEO.

55:13,57:17, @Mr L - but they did lay charges against Dudu for exposing the witness. Not sure when it will go to court though. Charges were laid against Ms Myeni @Mr L  Myeni matter was referred by DCJ to the NPA for action. "@ Andrew Mboweni: I have witnessed young people messing up in all respects in my life "@Sabelo Nxumalo  Sigh People are looking for anything to discredit this commission and its chairperson. eish she talks much I must say she is highly skilled in talking her way out of a paper bag!

57:28,58:49, I would rather be a tea girl at Prasa.

"zooma supporters like being robbed I liked how Zuma ends his meetings- he just keels over fall asleep and his ministers dismiss themselves. 
58:56,1:00:18, Yes you correct @Mzalwane Mzala enough tea girls at prasa laying about the offices and platforms in there weaves and on there cell phones ...and so rude "ramaphosa s biography  'Let me make an example x 10000 "Last night at the commission ""investigate"" .The same today" Dudu Myeni is attending a court case of which some of the things that are being said here on state capture are related to the case that she's attending.

"DCJ is setting her up  no problem Previous gm sv1 and aubrey I almost thought this SC would start with “be the change you want to see” The country started to go down at the point when it was not realised that excellent freedom fighters were not necessarily able to run a country So major positions became rewards instead of jobs  LIFE IS TOUGH NOW Mr Soni is one smart cookie - he is leading her nicely to expose her lies. DCJ is weaving a web to catch her out as well.

LOL pity the pay sucks. Your quality of life is how you are paying for all this mismanagement Im not sure how much loot Zuma escaped with I suspect not the amounts his henchmen or the Guptas escaped with.
