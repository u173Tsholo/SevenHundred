The Constitution of persons within their Minds / Brain.. controls actions as physical articulation. Stupidity; is taking Reality hostage to suit one's self. malemas eggs must be fried for a change. his suporters is destroying and messing up again outside the court. job creation I suppose. one messes and one picks up etc etc hi again..‚úãüèΩ I was watching the malema hearing... I noticed some odd stuff there "..for example 
31:06,35:42, @Peter @bongile Laurance wrestling in the dirt where he loves it best-that is why Malema has had him as his lawyer for 10 years "..üòéthere's lot off loopholes there. ( which I won't get into) ..also col Venter is a worker "NO MASKS  more trumped up charges against employees doing their job too well.. "NOTE; those young people(EFF) are disrespected by efforts of ignorant adults Illiteracy is the path taken by those whove had a decent education denied them and their parents.
