This lady is annoying with her lies No correlation here Ms Mentor 😱🤔 
39:36,41:45, Why are white people defensive on land issue when they themselves do not have land. Only a handful of white families own farms completely.

She wanted to be famous willie Hofmeyr at the Mogkoro inquiry was a 100xworse 
41:50,43:19, @ Indoda....cause we all got loans from the banks to BUY land/Property......not fer free Bra mentor 🙈 So much much is spent on entertaining Fakey's nonsense SHAME "To an extent i believe Mentor corruption is rife in SA probably service provided were paid to delete the records The banks are criminals and you should not be buying land from the banks. Where did they get the land from? IF YOU ASK ME I SMELL A RAT THESE PAST 2 DAYS ! OR A FEW RATS ! Indoda 80% of the 50% of the land is owned by the whites the minority. the other 20% is owned by everybody else. the rem 50% is with the state. 
43:41,44:24, You should be leasing the land from the state at lesser price and get discounts based on your harvests and what you make from the farm. Remember she is or was the whistleblower. much of the Public Protector's report stemmed from her statements. Lorrenzo..😂😂😂 everthing abt her is deleted... Mxm this lady 😔😔😔 jeevan. are you listening to the Zondo Commission "Aish Please help Chair @jeevan singh those calculations are flawed. 😳 
44:31,45:39, She's stressing almost all of Us😂😂 🤣🤣🤣 inferrence would only damage mentors testimony Mentor is an embarrassment. Lies have short legs This is just classic So Mentor is disputing everything. Even cellphone records @nhlanhla zwane she is not lying probably the manupulated the records LOOOOOOOOL Everything

Banks should never own the land. Where and how did they get the land? 
46:36,47:21, Mentor must tell us who paid her to lie "Chair Love for #Chair 😂😂😂Utlwang.. Vodacom treated her unfairly she is jus giving statements on what happened and at the same time trying not to incriminate herself at the same time Treated unfairly 😂😂😂 she right There must be a reason for them entertaining her lies. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 
47:30,48:27, letterhead Goolam If he's gay then he's on🤣🤣🤣 She always plays victim when she’s caught in a lie. I am happy lies are coming out. As South African we react too easy Cell C loves her but not vodacom Niematullah Rakeep you right "Vodacom They're leading her for her to expose herself and for everyone to see through her lies. 🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐 
48:35,49:38, Haaaa this lady is too much 😥 doff Zondo is wasting tax payers money with this women mentor was set up by Gordhan Jonas Kasrils after false info from her ? to implicate Zuma .

Phika lo mama sove uve ngathi unento yokwenza nasekhaya Zondo is not here to be popular or please anyone "She is running away from the simple questions "done already Zuma will leave this commission as laughing as always she is under oath ... why would she lie? 
50:30,51:43, goolam I respect Saleem She’s just waisting the commission’s valuable time.... The problem is that Mentor is wasting time and the lawyer was not allocated sufficient time. Goolam. he's not asking mentor after bathabile Dlamini embarrassing "I'm telling you now the truth will come out  The obsession with Zuma is shocking. @Nomvula Dlamini 😂 you think she's innocent The lies catching up 🤧🤧🤧 
51:50,53:08, she's botched it its a joke I think Mentor is not lying because she contacted many people in this regard so she cant lie involving so many people "The commission doesn't get the records from the Guptas (: lies. This is a joke indeed #Flightrecords Real criminals and liars will be exposed in the Zondo commission...Zuma warned us turned around!! "@Spaceman X she is not innocent but 
53:11,53:45, Dismiss this WITNESS "at least SHE IS A COMEDY instead she should say retracted Obviously these people were paid and deceived to lie how cld you rember time and date of things that happened 10 years ago/ unless its a day that you won lotto Thuli Madonsela must explain to the public why she believed Mentor as a credible witness mentor is a huge joke lier

54:54,55:16, Mentor is mental this is nonsense Hope baba is watching this and laughing cos they wasting money. if there is evidence go to the police station "Hayi "Is Vodacom making allegations on FB and testifying in front of a commission of inquiry are two different things Why Thuli Madonsela failed to investigate Mentor's version of testimony🤔 bi polar TSEK ! 
55:31,55:59, Mentor This woman should truly be charged with treason Thuli Madonsela is lap-puppy for Johann Rupert. she is mental indeed... She remembers nothing now... what should we believe? aarg indoda. they are all now Gupta department. all captured. I believe her the Guptas are powerful and I second you @lorrenzo mokgosana Only SAA is a public company she is a double agent..she can sell the country out 
56:04,57:08, "@Indoda Yamaqiniso hayike i really ain't got time for asinine people like you thuli was tasked to use any tool to implicate Zuma she can not say her memory cause she does not have any memory😂😂😂😂 I hope the cic has not address the president that side because I might waiting for him Thuli was just excited about juicy stories of state capture and forgot to double check for facts 🙈 She's lying siya Bonga. wrong. SAA is government "@Nhlanhla Zwane "I ask you a question that you fail to answer and all in a sudden you have no time to ""asinine"" people like myself.😂😂" 
57:11,57:48, Guptas were used to cover up real state capture by WMC. Their sin was to invade the territory which belonged to WMC waste of airtime....just 1 lie costs 100MB of my data Yes SAA is state owned 😪 @Sandile Dumisani Cele CIC has already addressed President... He spoke well lying what the entire version lol.so why does not zuma give his version We can't even compare BOSASA to the Guptas She is not lying unfortunately under oath they deal with hard evidence not hear say "It is state owned and it's not a ""government department""" 
57:57,58:43, both theives thanks jeevan for sticking to the subje Vodacom must also tell us why they can get records for some people and not Ms Mentor 🤔 Mentor has just been a waste of time really.🚶🚶🚶🚶 why dont all white ladies get with the fashion and wear wigs like black ladies it's so sexy Who will come after Mentor? indoda correct. state is government Then the volume goes up "Vodacom has an agenda. Remember 
58:53,1:00:07, Zuma.. I miss Agrizzi Mentor has a point 😪 who else is waiting for china to take over our country 😀 The state is not the government. The state is made up of: I keep all my emailed statements. So it’s possible Kaunda has records dating more than 5 years back.

SOMEONE THROW A SHOE AT HER ! she's drowning She lied about Siyabonga Cwele out of embarrassment she conceded that Mr Cwele was not a chair person of the portfolio committee.
