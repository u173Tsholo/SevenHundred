I see Peter Moyo's lawyer is in the house Seems like they are scared of Jamnandas tho.. Whats your take? Mpofu is finished 
27:10,34:42, "They are here destroy Gordhan This tsotsi‚Äôs always act as innocent and smart shame this bokvels 2015 state capture was already happening Zuma was doing what he pleases "Why are we arguing about this coz Gordhan steals nothing Has anyone been arrested since this commission was established? @tikvah Olam Why would 'they' be afraid. All that is required here is the truth. So Judge Zondo is declining this application to cross examine Ghordan? Who set up that reportü§î just blowing smoke screens again This guyüòÇ 
38:57,42:48, So will Tom cross examine Papa G or what? eff just came in... are we finished with Gen Jaya Mpofu wont stop talking Notshi Maronza Bee BLOCKED QED. (look it up!) I can see Tom.. Where is Gordon? Is it Mpofu applying for this application? This guy is still milking Mr Moyane. Yah neh!!! Mpofu just pushes without any facts but why? 
42:59,46:47, "Seems like every office under Zupta administration acted independently in support of the same objective: total control. Though they are isolated "Mpofu thinks he is a brilliant lawyer but he is so incoherent when he makes an argument "He gets his facts from :social media analysts. He doesn't have a case here üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è well stated that is my point @ Brother Louis "He lies so easy with a straight face All the separate dots make a clear picture. The SC Inquiry broom must clean up with one big sweep. "we as black  @ Noshi Maronza Bee I am willing but moyane should answer his version I cant make sense of anything Mpofu is trying say or argue. I am no Lawyer but yey andimva tu. 
46:58,48:39, There is no ground to prosecute Gordhan really "There is nothing to investigate there "@Raymond Mohlamonyane What is the Rogue Unit? "@Raymond Mohlamonyane I am not proud of SC Mpofu @Heather Cotton Hahahaha every court. What's Option 1 and Option 2 all the crooks hire this one True @Raven 
48:46,50:16, There was political pressure to oppress Gordhan as he was gunning for SC beneficiaries. This is enough motivation "Dali has won these argument shem well said @Yin Yang "@Humani Duncan .yes "If you don't think you have a strong enough case "I agree he should cross examine @Concerned South African I agree @Yin Yang shallow analysis 
50:19,52:12, Jamnandas must be Cross Examined... üòÇüòÇüòÇ GIDAE "Greetings from #PaySlipbanSA üòÉ We want the Competition Commission investigated - all those fines @Eliot Chauke Moyane has Jamnandas by his Jamnandas Moyane can only cross examin if he gives evidence at the commission I walked in at the right time... üòÉ Zondo pls pull gordhan to come answer for his role in stealing from S.A. ns "@Notshi Maronza Bee  "@Raymond Mohlamonyane you are disillusional if you believe that 
52:28,54:36, "@ Noshi Maronza Bee EFF has nothing nothing to push here @Humani Duncan you are not black This guy is milking his moment a bit "@Raymond Mohlamonyane is the only black person @makhosi nobhatyi I agree..needs reporting DCJ please stop your entertainment of these VBS looters EFF and ANC what a yawwwwn! They both allow black people to be paid less than whites.... üòû @Slindile Ngcobo Adv Mpofu is not a VBS looter @Jack Sparrow racists should keep their mouth shut 
54:45,56:00, @Heather Cotton Gordhan has stolen nothing. EFF kiddies just make a lot of noise Eskom on its knees him being at helm...even with Zuma there in no proof I never hear Cde Mpofu cdes "There is nothing more tiresome than arguing with EFF zombies please this s not about color its greed and crooked people The EFF is an ANC-controlled sideshow. They made Malema. "I Am Free ‚Äã@Notshi Maronza Bee  @Raymond Mohlamonyane I also have my doubts if you represent all Black people officially. I think you speak only for yourself. Your admiration of Mpofu is quite in order but it is not universal. @Norman Zwane I dont need any office to represent my people 
56:16,59:30, "@ Carol berry it is bad to be here talk about this issue @Raymond Mohlamonyane I'm sure you and Hlaudi are cut from the same cloth. "ooooh @Norman Zwane haha you wish @Heather Cotton look at this way were did he get the monies to buy all that illegal equipment used to spy on people the surveillance tools used on NPA @Notshi Maronza Bee ...if you want to throw a blow...you must be prepared to take a blow...over and out let him tell his side of the story then he can cross examine gordan This advocate looks quite tall to me... Mob-politics is a real thing. 
59:34,1:05:47, lot of ef els lol everything for free @makhosi nobhatyi true "Soes was broken during 9 years so what you see now spending more money it is a result of looting in those entities Jamnandas cant convince the DCJ not to grant leave to cross examine "We are tired of Moyane @Gee Peex1 it takes a long time to turn the ship around "@Humani Duncan 
1:05:55,1:08:26, @Humani Duncan agree @Humani Duncan LOL "@Gee Peex you need to check the facts before you reach final answer the ship is already at the bottom of the ocean @Gee Peex1 as long as its slowing down..it is turning..thats why Zondo is so important "@Raymond Mohlamonyane please stop engaging with me what id Zondo doing kahle kahle? Can judge Zondo please adopt me ‚ò∫ 2100 listeners tuned in. And about 5 people are dominating this chat group. The other 2095 are not interested in your personal squables. 
1:08:47,1:11:31, they spent more than double than they should have on those power stations @Humani Duncan but i was asking a question. why are you emotional ? true ZONDO FOR PRESIDENT !!!!!! 16 Jamnadas is backtracking. running away from x examination and all of them are free We will still have these thieves on our screens come next year October. Zero arrests.. more looting baseless arguements. "Spend more money than saving to fix problems facing Eskom once and for all 
1:11:34,1:12:59, Run Jamnadas.. RUN!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ "disastorous appointment of des van rooyen 4 a weekend Is Moyane sitting right there? THIS IS ALL ABIG SHOW TO SATISFY THE COMMON PEOPLE "The thieves thought they would go home Scot-free "i can't hear this lady """A Minister not involved in the operation of Eskom""? What GIBBERISH is this?" money moyane The ANC is the problem - get rid of them and half of our troubles disappear. 
1:13:11,1:15:00, true Justice Zondo üòÅ "Public Protector is holding back the VBS investigations "If there is a case why NPA not prosecuting Gordhan no one stopped them to do so SHOOT* get rid of the ANC and then what? "Hi @Notshi Maronza Bee not Europeans...whites. And it's happening now - look at income inequality data. All political parties are complicit darling get rid of other halve the eff @makhosi nobhatyi The NPA say they don't have enough resources to investigate and prosecute all the corruption. 
1:15:08,1:18:03, "This is bad @Sbo Gumede Then we look for leaders with integrity. WE ARE WASTING MILLIONS OF RANDS FOR THIS CIRCUS....A BULLIT IS MUCH CHEAPER trow him out of a plane do those leaders exist @Derek Main? There is no case at all @ Derek main @Sbo Gumede I don't think we can do any worse than the ANC cadres. They are corrupt to the core. You'd have to be a real idiot to still vote for the ANC after hearing of all their corruption here at the commission. Stupid Moyana again. üò™ 
1:18:15,1:19:54, "@Derek Main so are the leader of the other parties Pravin doesn't want to be cross examined Moyane dismantled SARS and took it to the brink of collapse and that in my opinion that is treasonous. @Sbo Gumede Sorry? Run that by me again. I wish the judge would give Moyane a chance to cross-examine. I just want to see what his plan is. @mandisi ntauzana pravin doesn't want moyane to get his way after nearly destroying sars Gordhan was a finance minister he saw these revelations mr Moyane was not respecting the finance minister moyane too must tell us what happened then he can cross examine "DA 
1:20:00,1:22:22, Then why doesn't Pravin allow himself to be tested under cross examination as he has made numerous allegations against Tom we all are captured "@mandisi ntauzana he will allow himself to be tested if the chair decides so. but it makes perfect sense to not just kowtow to moyane's desires. it's a battle We era paying more taxes in South Africa because of Moyana. He protected his friends from paying tax. Are we running short of yellow overalls here? Has Minister Lamula run out of budget ? @Stellabanda stella he does not want to tell us what he did with Sars all he want to discredit Gordhan by accusing him of maladministration "@Raven Penny @Sbo Gumede you are both right. Rising income inequality reflects wage pricefixing @I Am Free Never heard of them but on this chat. sorry "I am finding difficult this morning to follow Zondo‚Äôs thought process.. It is clear the question before him is one of did he Gordhan LETS START THE ZONDO POLITICAL PARTY 
1:22:26,1:24:46, he stole a lot He has already rejected the application. This is very important. "But Jack @African Refugee doesn't understand terms of reference in a commission üòÇ all the politicians are corrupt @mandisi ntauzana pravin will come across very well under cross examination. and in his court case against the pp. but his objective is to show the middle finger to moyane. i'd do the same Is the Tom Moyane story back again or what? 
1:25:12,1:26:22, "That is the point Moyane must speak about his involvement in state capture "@African Refugee what a stupid thought process you have Jack i don't think Pravin will survive cross examination. mandisi ntauzana .. Why does Tom avoid giving evidence? Also at the Nugent Commission? "@mandisi ntauzana we will see in his court case against the pp Now Zondo is beginning to make sense. @I Am Free I now understand what you are referring to. Thats not a bad idea at all. Zondo has been brilliant. so ....I am free too? 
1:26:36,1:28:23, Let Moyana make a submission to the commission before he can be granted leave to cross examine Mr Gordan "Unfortunately the PP case won't have cross examination More evidence will be exposed about his shenanigans when he held sars Freeeedom üòÇ "adv Roux is pls throw jamnandas under the bus funded by who @makhosi nobhatyi You are so right brother. Moyane has a lot to talk about and answer Russia "pius194 ‚Äã.. I think you are going to be disappointed 
1:28:31,1:30:45, "@African Refugee I see you're a Zupta But what is so difficult here? Minister Gordhan has nothing to hide right? Why does he just set aside a day and see what Mr Moyane has? hmm hmm hmm how can people support moyane @Mangalani Mangalani agree Moyana must testify before the Zondo commission. üòÖüòÖüòÖ look at mr moyane now where is monyane now? you also captured zondo 
1:30:51,1:32:18, I am beginning to have my doubts on Gordhan zondo...u. the next chief justice @Carrol berry. He is seated right here @ Pastor J exactly brother if you remember Gordhan was stating that are facing financial bad dropped moyane he came saying he collected trillions which was rebuked by other witness here that he lied Moyane has no shame at all. To sit there and laugh why not suppose to continue with Mr. Naidoo's testimony today? "Moyane we wil stay captured @makhosi nobhatyi 50Billion I believe 
1:32:20,1:34:06, Is monyani still in office? He is laughing @Sbo Gumede It's not possible to be more corrupt than the ANC. I agree that all politicians are corrupt but the ANC have taken corruption to another level altogether. carol berry ‚ÄãIs monyani still in office? NO Where have you been?????!!!! Do you think Moyana is different from Zuma? He's been dismissed @carol berry Exactly That is the big worry "Does EFF support corruption 
1:34:18,1:35:22, The commission will loose creditability "Innocent people don't hide behind lawyers @Pastor J Moyane was serving his master Zuma. Ask yourself how did Jimmy Manyi be able to buy New age newspaper and NTA Zondo is now having to justify himself This is about Moyane and SARS. Lets not forget that Moyane is deeply implicated in the Bosasa and Correctional Services as well. dismissed or not still eating our money yes @makhosi nobhatyi 1000% correct @African Refugee I dont agree..it makes people more careful..slows down the ship 
1:36:05,1:38:53, hence we are captured moyane is nervous..look at him Get Moyane to testify.... simple.... then you can consider this application "@Robert Russell yes if he can come aand visit @Robert Russell Correct 100%. Then he can also explain his role about Bosasa and Correctional Services whilst he was Commissioner Yes he must be subpoenaed Has Moyane at any point been to testify at this Zondo Commission? Why is Tom Moyane not taking the witness stand and the tell the country his version of the events? We are not disputing the fact that Gordhan must held accountable too but Moyane not telling us truth all he is interested in is to say Rogue unit was unlawful 
1:38:59,1:40:42, "moyana cannot continue to be an opportunist @Singi Mathebula I agree DCJ‚úäüèø‚úäüèø‚úäüèøüî•üî•üî•üî• She is already withdrawing yes withdraw Hawu this Lawyer is plain rude nje.

1:40:48,1:41:31, KPMG and Blain and Co have all paid back their ill gotten gains.... and Moyane is hanging onto their reports???????? @zintle ndzwangu is it important that she's white? moyane give your version The pressure at SARS is reflected here. Capture SARS = Own everything! she is right Moyane should be handed a 3.3 notice before he leaves the commission. She was on point. @I Am Free She said PP report is discredited @Raven Penny agree 
1:41:32,1:42:54, @Jack Sparrow I think i wouldnt have mentioned it if it wasnt important. she is really on the defence of gordan something is fishy here She is being paid@Rudi H "this advocate she speaks of no proof that is why she is withdrawing @zintle ndzwangu is it important that she's a woman? are all these guys in defence of gordan "@Singi no doubt "This is simple She was awesome !!!!!! 
1:43:47,1:46:16, "@Robert Russell  *her Law is law Moyane must tell us truth which charges he put to Gordhan I conclude the following: "@African Refugee no Moyane was part of state capture together with Gordhan at some stage so now they protecting Gordahn She is implying very clearly that Moyane must testify..hes a coward There was a fall out 
1:46:19,1:48:56, true "@African Refugee you're so tiring Now Moyane wants to spill beans on Gordhan and Gordhan is playing all tricks to run away Gordhan must tell us why and how Moyane is involved in state capture. In fact he should have laid charges on that long time ago. live rugby please ican fill it moyane his going to be grant a permission to examine here watch. I absolutely agree with her "i've changed my mind. @African Refugee is arrogant *and* foolish "On he completion of this commission's investigation into State Capture.. this will bring about more transparency within GMT depts. 
1:48:57,1:50:33, I don't think so@Omega godi regtig @Mangalani Mangalani..... unlike you I am not a judge.... but as a betting man I would put my money on Gordhan to come out clean as opposed to your mate Moyane What is Tom Crook Moyane jotting down there? Where is his Orange Overall? Zondo seem to have none of what all this people say or want. he look agitated by the argument brought to the fore @African Refugee No - Zuma just perfected state capture. Pretorius is the main man. "@Robert Russel Unlike you Zintle NdzwanguüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 
1:50:35,1:52:05, I am on the side of the truth he was "Why they hate this man so much @carol berry They both must be questioned to get to the truth. yep because he is light white lol Mpofu fumbling as usual. "@African Refugee Should state capture before 1995 be ignored? Of course not - if you have any evidence "This ""State Capture"" report findings will be used as a template that will define what state capture is... how it oprates and how it can/must be eradicated within GMT.." 
1:52:11,1:53:21, @Yolo More how is he gubling? @African Refugee Should we ignore recent state capture because the past has not been dealt with. Of course not! moyana must tell us why he gave GUPTAS illegitimate tax refunds? was that not furtherance of the state capture? Are we even going to listen to Mr Naidoo today? Im so over these two thiefs. "The minute somebody is on thin ice Capture state from who? But Mangalani the rules of the commission say in order to cross-examine you must give your version. Which Moyane hasn't done. What is he afraid of? eff "@African Refugee the floor is all yours 
1:53:22,1:55:02, JAMNANDAS CAPTURED SOUTH AFRICAN BALLS @African Refugee Let‚Äôs deal with it after completing this one "this ""tempalate are in exsostence for many years it is called stealing" Mpofu is wasting our time now Moyane must say his version first Exactly my point @ Lamola. we will be here for ever @ Singi Mathebula exactly that is what we want to know in my opinion there will be a review cross examination @Pheladi Lamola Moyane does not deny giving evidence. It is mandatory to provide evidence as part of terms of reference 
1:55:30,1:57:13, get rid anc and eff this capture on the measurement of the richter scale is 11 Can my learned friend sit down please? I think Dali is overrated @African Refugee You are right but we are dealing with state capture in the past 20 yrs here @GH MG how so? Mpofu argument is not state things as lawyer now you not a virgin Mpofu is a bad speaker that's why he always politicize everything. 
1:57:35,1:58:58, Get Moyane to testify first..... discredit himself first.... and the be allowed to cross examine PG Mugabe is eating with idi amin @African Refugee So what do you suggest? It sounds like you think the entire commission should be disbanded since the earlier state capture has not been dealt with. Is that your assertion? He mumbles and mumbles incoherently.....and i think he relies on previous wins to demonstrate his competency Zondo ruled out about that supplemental "Zondo must stop Mpofu @African Refugee I agree but let‚Äôs deal with immediate issues before jumpingto the moon watching from The Bahamas. Why does Dali always represent the crooks....????? 
1:59:00,2:00:00, "See now Zondo is not jumping in as Dali speaks big crooked virgin He keeps repeating himself @Robert Russell i had the same question "@African Refugee what is your point This lady must just say tha Min Gordan did not mean that and the Chairperson will dismiss this circus of Dali...Finish and klaar "@African Refugee I'm all for the commission - if just one corruption case is dealt with because of commission 2 year old child ?! sjoe @GH MG that is your flawed opinion

2:21:32,2:24:41, @African Refugee Yes - I agree. That is the legacy of colonisation - an inferiority complex. But the colonisers are still plundering despite no longer running the country through captured politicians. Lunch in a Tea-break skin What rubbish Derek. thando nkutha and vbs brothers @Born free Which part is rubbish? It is the Chinese DEREK and they are not colonialists and neither are the ANC comrades of corruption. @im free The queen of England is sitting with the diamond on the crown made out of gold from southern Africa so true @Gee Peex1 can work this parrot is confusing himself a pity because it is tax money he is ways and i have schnapps a few and yes it does confuse you after a while in a meaning full way lol 
2:24:52,2:26:57, Derek you are caught in a time warp free yourself from mental slavery.. immancipate your mind. @I Am Free I'm not sure where I said anything about the globalist agenda. The colonisers I am talking about are the countries who have colonised us economically. why does Moyane not come to the table and answer questions "@Born free If you have something of substance to say that we can debate he s under the table That was of substance.. DEREK the piont is you are making is there is no piont @African Refugee Couldn't agree more - we have a class issue not a race issue. And the greed has gone stratospheric. boring stuff colonized and apartheid 
2:27:15,2:30:56, @Derek Main I agree Che! all of us are captured South Africa indebted itself i am captured ......i am married i fully agree agree you are capsules @African Refugee The really sad thing is that we all allow the greed and corruption to continue because we are unable to unite against it.

2:31:28,2:35:30, Tom Moyane is a coward who never open his mouth to talk for himself. he did the same with the Nuggent commission. Yip that's why other countries own us. State Capture would cause the repayments to be diverted to criminal coffers. Did you see China Military parade 2019? but who are the new dispensation the majority "@ I am Free @I Am Free Being a victim is a choice. repuclican party and a crook stays a crook @Thando Nkutha I put it that many of our divisions are caused by politicians because it serves their nefarious agendas. @Derek Main true its how you handle problems

Do you own a house or simplex or flat that is situated on a piece of land? BRING BACK OUR LAND ITS BELONG TO US @Thando Nkutha I think the land question needs to be addressed but not Zim-style. @Gee Peex1 you are right one issue that is bothersome with the bantu stans all of them were under black rule and no nasionilzed where are that land now please inform Now Derek.. what you said about the ANC.. is substance üòÅ "@Thando Nkutha I don't believe people should simply be given land 
2:44:41,2:46:10, after chowing the land they wil eat all the cattle from the age of 5 Then themselves üòÇ The ANC is going to give us land. Productivity on those farms is going to fall sharply. The country will then rely on foreign aid. Then the politicians will blame the same land beneficiaries. @Rob Nel How can you buy back something that was stolen???? @Born free I have a house that I am paying a bond on - the bank owns it.
