35:10,38:49, how can these cowards targeting women and children be dealt with? @Lelatsa same Sidney ... SABC is more descriptive of the SOE he comes from and GCEO doesn't tell of which company @Lelatsa Lorna GCEO stands for Group Chief Executive Officer "@Granny Mokwena such must be castrated and have their hands chopped .... but is this the way to go when the ruling party cannot govern the country? Rather vote for a party who can rule properly. For the record i didn't vote NP. cut or remove any part of their body which is troubling them@Granny 
39:16,44:08, @Lorna Kavanagh which party can govern the country properly? The DA would be better. stiil to be conceived @ngomani "men are troubled in this country this guy looks like a private schooled Bheki Cele.... I have faith in Ramaphosa but not sure about others in the ANC . "@Lorna Kavanagh DA is simply the replication of NP carnoth ngomane for your info NP went into the ANC Carnoth .... the DA was nothing like the NP. 
44:09,48:59, agree. but let3 not streep naked as well. @granny The ANC has become just like the NP - they learnt well from the oppressors.

Sorry There were to many acting people This was a Holiwood Those that fought apartheid gave long since left SA. They are enjoying their lives in Britian never to return. Those that fought for change don't live in SA any longer and have not since 1994 They fought for change and when there became change.. they ran away. Yin Yang ‚Äã@Concerned South African the fight against appartheid was hijack by the wrong people the bad guys..the guys who got power was selected from the bottom of the barrel: Understood. Thanks. What was diesel doing at SABC anyone lets start talking about us as people not black ot white so as none of us feels as if he is better than another 
1:35:26,1:37:09, Mbuso Ndlovu ‚ÄãWhat was diesel doing at SABC anyone. Probably stanby generators for load shedding? Reasonable deduction. @funicans ja ne thts insane jc imagen y don't u hire tht Peron full once Depressing to hear all this about SABC the change came about only when de klerk saw the futility of a failed polacy and the anc never fought the sadf no battles against us we went into africa and took some threats out for a failed policy @Concerned South African Next time they will have beer in case run out of water hi everybody ANC recycles its corrupt members. follow this proceedings ! we didn't see fire on news 
1:37:27,1:40:38, Mbuso Ndlovu . I'm blocking you. I AGREE no race cards needed here we are all suffering due to a few people who could not help the country but knew how to help themselves mbuso ndlove their are stored as reserves jc incase workers and bussiness must pay more taxes for SoE's to survive. SOE's are a joke They are milking RSA I only want to know where he is buried so I can spit on his grave. Lets shut them down and save more money milk cows ask ace he is in the dairy busness 
1:41:16,1:51:16, Neo lol are u sure abt tht Judge Zondo. also ask the question about when will unions be removed. they are the once protecting bad useless workers from been laid off and good people hired. they can't be shut down mf2 their are like needs for any country "Ace theory and practice are different @Sabelo thnx Yig Yang for spirit lets hope so we are screwed by the anc so keeon voting for them and blame it on apartheid rsa 1652 cpt built entire sa to whom it may concern and be cool calm and collective viva azania 
1:51:19,1:59:25, flatten sa and lets start afresh guys who believes that watson is actually dead 4 real....or it's other way to end all of this in the public eye.....um saying this cs Zuma said he'll talk...and when he was called he revealed a lots world should kiss our rsa hands a @Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu I believe he is dead but I don't believe it was an accident. @mahfuz8599114 You don't seem to realise how insignificant we are in the bigger scheme of things. you all are pro no doubt let's call for commission to send you back from where you come from What a fool you are Neo....Neo Mongale‚ÄãWe call for a commission of inquiry into apartheid and colonization now 
2:01:53,2:11:07, @Derek main ...lets agree to disagree cs i believe that his testmony would hv implicated lots of ppl on ur gov n that would scare away investors....so they agreed to fake his dead to end his part Yes Neo...That would really help our future. When that comm's completed we can start another one to ventilate Chaka's brutalization of minor tribes. neo go back to upper Africa @Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu I don't discount that possibility (for the reasons you've given). That's why I think it was a planned suicide. The timing of his death was just far too convenient. @Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu There are just too many questions. Why did he not fly through the windscreen? Why wasn't there a lot of blood since he have large gashes to his neck and face. @Phiwayinkosi Mngomezulu Why didn't he brake? Why no cellphone or briefcase? Why in Toyota? Where was he going? they say one thing you can be sure of is death and taxes..imagine having some much money like GW that you kill yourself! Neo walking a thin line. stop the blame game and bring up ways to fix it. many students and people qualified looking for work that can replace the thieves out there. and they would do a better job @Derek Main you don't always fly through the windscreen. Suicide seems the most likely answer. 
2:12:12,2:19:28, @Justin Kennerley No - you don't always but he wasn't wearing a seatbelt and was going very fast. He should at least have hit his head on windscreen (if not gone right through). "Go watch crash test videos It's nice at the Gavin Watson funeral! @Justin Kennerley Are you saying no dummies go through windscreen? I would be very surprised. Justin/Derek. is it not a charge if you witness a crash and dont stop to help or call the police. I find it odd that both witnesses did not stop and only came forward 2 days later. they should charge @Yin Yang Yep - our ANC cadres have no qualms about fraternising with criminals. Birds of a feather and all that. @Michael Wild You might be right - I'm just not sure about that. @Michael Wild You are very right. A law does exist that requires every licensed motorist to stop and render and/or request assistance in the event of an accident and injuries "and the Cell phone still a mystery 
2:23:24,2:55:59, Neo you here to talk about the subject or raise other issues. there are courts to claim land it you have proof. This lady is all over the place "@mthetheleli mndawe  This advocate needs to prepare the words in her mind before speaking - very annoying hesitancy all the time. She is very likeable. Always deferring to the chair who she? Hlaudi is coming finally. can't wait to see him exposed. @Ibo Head of news thanks @Nomsa Mdhluli 
2:58:51,3:07:32, @Mabusela....chief is that offical????????????????? if so I can't wait!!!!! love that human being!!! @Muzi Dube. he has been invited So she is the right person to be ask the bugling mind question on: why the SABC website is so rubbish and their articles are so nonsensical & short in such way you can‚Äôt compare them to news24 or DM? "@Ibo Thabo News24 and DM are newspapers @Justin Kennerley Both h ave journalists "They have different mandates. The SABC journalists broadcast heir news "@Justin Kennerley I said website "@Ibo Thabo exactly my point @Justin Kennerley Just a very small point to be made. News24 is probably a medium sized broadcaster of live events both on the Youtube platform and their own news site. This commission is live 
3:09:16,3:12:35, "@Justin Kennerley most if not all of the SABC website and twitter accounts are badly written @Pastor J they moved to the digital space due to lower newspaper sales. "@Justin Kennerley Can you look at CNN @Mabusela hope he accptes the invite... correct@Justin Kennerley Suffers Lack of money = lack of improvement and innovation Brazen looting = lack of money "@Justin Kennerley I guess not just staff shortage but intelligence 
3:14:23,3:28:27, Plus a lack of leadership that effectively enforces rules and prcoesses. @Justin Kennerley Keep in mind the over R250 million salaries we pay to those incompetents every month Lets blame it all on the Silly Goat Cloudy Hlaudi. yhoooooo The Human resources department is the worst. ze are crazy of south african pelope "Tired about this @Makwa Choma Maybe tomorrow or friday. SAPS dont work on weekends .Only 8 to 4pm daily. ü§£ü§£ü§£ @Pastor J Minus tea and lunch times? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
