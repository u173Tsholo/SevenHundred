He did talk about the tenders mos :washhands: its really unfortunate the poor masses of SA who are the most affected by ANC corruption never get to see this enquiry. "Free State matter Adv Leah Gcabashe SC is leading the evidence of Ms Seipati Dhlanini. 
56:57,1:04:30, They should have set up free to air TV channel for this commission. It makes for a better informed public. Vrede Dairy Farm related evidence from the next witness : Ms Seipati Dhlamini "Gcabashe is great ace is the joker in the pack @Kevin Simon agreed. They've already spent so much money anyway @RC Swart just cut and paste job! oh yes all the gangsters will be gathered around the boardroom table chowing steak & egg sandwiches at Lootfreely House glued to the screen & their fat bank balances "Hoping that they are able to read witness looks tired /hope not coved 19 
1:05:07,1:07:01, Another one that won't know date of marriage and forgot own birthdate but it will come back to her is this witness OK tho?? If Dlamini wants to be a BEE beneficiary she should be able to take the punch she was making tea in the office thanks mark Ace is the Ali Baba of the thieves in Dairy Farm Bonanza. I mic Mr Ndzeku yhoo that man😁😁 "😆 eish Ace of Spades 
1:07:37,1:09:10, she was CFO 😆 Dlamini knows nothing from the body language. chief financial officer I can’t recall .... she's finna lie this one🤣🤣 Ace is the devil hiding behind the devilites Big paying job Had to read that from a piece of paper? What's happening here?

""" Qualified"" 😆" Homeland Uni..😂😂🙆🏾‍♀️🙆🏾‍♀️ So she should have a minimum BCOM degree plus lots of experiance pass one pass all MBA 
1:13:16,1:14:48, "@SABC News  Remember it is only 30% degree Should a CFO not be a CA ? Evidence leader is popping up in holes slowly we will hear some flames She should have said : matric...

1:17:23,1:19:55, this advocate is thorough..... she is on a journey here Zondo was the right person to chair this commission I agree with you @Akhonanamandla Hofmeyer now!!!! ms gcabashe is quite capable aswell "Read the flow chart @thabiso mngadi.... she is. very thorough Ms Repeat 😆 unlike the guy who is dealing with bossasa matters. 
1:19:57,1:21:13, the only weakest link is Mr Nortjie Slow witted CFO this is the mature version of Ms Hofmeyer beautiful to watch a legal asasin @Freedom what is wrong with Ms Gcabashe? (5marks) Hofmeyer is not available currently. @Zip 😂😂😂 Hofmeyer now!!!! Come on! Was this person a CFO 👩‍💼🙆🏽‍♀️🙆🏽‍♀️ The requirements for gov CFO position seem very low..... 
1:21:16,1:22:20, @Freedom 0/5 my money on this ADV Mr Noshe must go here please chair Hofmeyer now!!! I wonder if the coinage is also chowed as slow as her replies If the witness is ANC then she is guilty as sin. "She is bringing her steadily to the trap In the end she'll plead ignorance Ms Gcabashe excellent.... just setting the dimwit up for a mauling...
