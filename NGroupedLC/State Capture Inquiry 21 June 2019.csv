11:47,18:29, commission prosecutors are amateurish..eish.. this is council for Mr v wyk "u do wanna stall he is been bribed with a mill.. These are just delay tactics best learned from Zuma if he is not guilty why worry about recordings? bring the next witness and play the recordings. This is a tactical move to stop the recordings from being heard coming with dubious excuses.. we need the money stolen back to create jobs..looks like this commission is going to take 10 years.. government money doesn't create jobs businesses create jobs government money is tax money paid by people who have jobs 
18:35,20:38, think from now on the stolen money will stream in the stolen money can create jobs.... government creates jobs..did u listen to the s SONA ydae The private sector and Investor confidence creates jobs. I agree Government does not create jobs. no government dont create jobs they give tenders to companies that already exist We are waiting for the money people come on don’t delay proceedings jobs create government Tenders through Nepotism not Merit. 
21:00,24:16, tenders create jobs..... We want to create jobs indeed this is the problem half the country dont even understand how simple things work tenders create greedy b####ts who do not finish their job but chow the money Tenders only create jobs for those involved in government this is the purpose of the commission..... wipe out corruption Lomama is firm this lady should be in the parliament. smart and has a great way to put points forward.
