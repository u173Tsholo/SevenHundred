Correct its done that way deliberately @Diss & Dad I won't argue with that - I'm no fan of the Clintons but I don't feel we should cherry-pick which of the guilty to go after. Estina is/was a Gupta company @Diss & Dad Trump has admitted that he travelled on the Lolita Express - the purpose of which was to engage in paedophilia.
