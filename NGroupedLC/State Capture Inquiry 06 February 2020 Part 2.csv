4:29,13:15, There will a huge historical account The chiÃ§kens have come home to roost "Yooo ESKOM @Person No! 20yrs+ behind. Press donâ€™t bother you comrade India cheaper on Teeth and many other ðŸ’°ðŸ’°operations Zuma and Cuban cigars any connection? "I am trying to understand why ministers seek medical treatment outside SA. or do they? is it press Mischief Though I'm not so sure now. I was last in Thailand 5 years ago when 1Rand = 3 Thai Bhat. Now can only get 2 Bhat for a Rand. oh OK thanks! 
14:30,23:42, @Dominic Your correct Baht very strong This is an interesting witness. gives us a peep into how things work in the industry. @Person of interest Yup the difference in exchange rate is proportional to the amount of Rands which have disappeared into Dubai. Yes Africans are up and coming we need to come to together as one people "Is BB-BEE not meant to be ""broad based"" ? So its quite cool for 1 person to be the BB-BEE component in a multi million dollar deal and that 1 person gets all the benefits ?" "Some Africans are up and coming eg. Rwanda did we learn anything from Rwanda? lol We too busy trying to learn enough to get 30%. Don't have enough time or energy to learn anything else. 
24:53,36:59, any info from sadec on the Namibian fishrot case we don't have the patience of the Zimbabwean people. but we learned to not trust our mainstream media We have a government who believe communism is the answer to all our problems. They haven't yet heard about the collapse of the Soviet Union. Zondo so far has spent R350 million. NPA got R1.5 billion. Still not one conviction for corruption. wuttt???? I'm in. he's off his meds again "me too Stay on the subject of the day. what they talking about. it's not a general chat room. its about today's topic. 
37:55,45:33, "yes boys "A blessed afternoon to all of you Hello @Pastor J "@Pastor J blessed afternoon to you too Hello my Dear Friend@Anne M. ...@redriger ...@Michael Wild .....@Immanuel and anyone else I may have missed. Who/What is AAR? Greetings @Dominic Przybylski Hi AAR was the company that yesterday's witness was involved with 
45:59,50:58, Thanks @Anne M. I missed yesterday. AAR wanted the supply contract with SAA Technical They are an American based Aircraft and Aviation Related Repair Company @Dominic Przybylski Hello Pastor So AAR has no BEE connection? I think JM (local BB component) for AAR who won the tender under dubious circumstances. AAR is an American company I think "Yes. They were tightly attached to a local company. Therein lies a lot of ""fun"" to come. JM Aviation" Correct Kevin 1.8 billion contract that does not function....incredible 
51:55,1:01:05, @Kevin seems to be standard procedure in public sector. government is mind control @Stronger together It seems you underestimate just how big a billion is. @Stronger together This is not the only fishy contract at SAA. so in short...the local BB component gets 53 million for doing fakkal....just to aid in a corrupt deal and spend the money "17 million social grants is peanuts compared to what we are giving to pay for ex-presidents' and retired MPs benefits and pension payouts to Molefe types Which makes all this graft and corruption all the more atrocious Imagine if we could recoup just 50 % of all stolen money....We could settle ESCOM and SAA problems and have change left over I spoke to a guy the other day...a very very clever dude.....he says the following 
1:01:32,1:09:43, "We will recoup nothing of the stolen money. It is long gone Assume SA receives R 10 inntax revenue using the current tax legislation....if we scrap the current tax system and replace it with the following Every bank transaction is taxed 2 % and payed into one government tax account we would generate R25.... no SARS offices required. No paperwork...Everyone pays 2 % irrespective of earnings and spending @Sipho The Xing Agreed. Government already owns more than the rest of us combined yet still want more. Cape Town sitting on R18 billion while introducing extra taxes and levies. They have more than they can spend (underspent by R4 billion) last year but they still try to take even more from the citizens. DA are even worse than ANC. Redriger it's simple....may paycheck is taxed 2%...I spend my paycheck and taxed 2 %....all controlled by the banks.... @Sipho The Xing What planet are you on? Our government is a communist government. @redriger Join Capitec. 
1:10:49,1:20:53, Everyone just pays 2 % tax on each bank transaction....no VAT....no paye... @Stronger together I get 9.5% interest on 5 year fixed deposit. British banks give from 0% to .02% interest on balance. but if rand keeps getting worse your interest in ponds if more is more @redriger Always had fantastic service from Capitec. Only bank which opened an account faster was one in Thailand. 15 minutes from entering a branch to having a card and drawing from ATM. I came into some significant capital back in 1990 and bought us dollars and invested overseas. Usd to ZAR was then 2.50.....now its R 14.82 Now Donald Trump is the boss....I will never win My first car cost me R450. I got married in 1990ðŸ˜‚ 
1:23:03,1:29:55, @Stronger together Geography? Franceland? Sipho I only got my business degree at 31 so never give up. Run if you can. I am from Botswanaland Bill Gates dropped out of university in 2nd year. Richest man in the world. Degree means nothing if you don't have self-discipline. Try Namibia Don't look for a job. Look for an opportunity. well said Dom....no true word spoken "@Dominic Przybylsk Indeed and goes together with ""Self-motivation"""
