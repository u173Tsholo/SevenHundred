time,-4:59,message Morning Rubin. I think he actually believes his own explanations. The mentality of the man is astounding! "Cloudy Hlaudi reminds me of an old saying...."" If you play soccer in the dark hands off Hlaudi "WBS on 6 Dec 2013. A guest speaker does not make an academic. At no stage has Mr Motsoeneng lectured at WBS "can i remind everyone that the 20 years @André du Plessis Very poignant and true. andre your white th do what does it matter if he is white or not. the truth is the truth so stop been racist and biost lets get behind the truth and let the law run its course 
-3:53,-0:04, Andre did you know? 😀😁🤣😂 But Hlaudi had talent 🤣 Block any racist..I just blocked @the do can we start They are running late again Morning everybody. "Talent can get you further than a matric certificate  Born free I tend to agree with you but the question is did he use his talent in the right way probably a meeting in chambers 
0:07,1:19, Hlaudi is a living example why education is necessary! wangena umfoka Zondo madoda Here we go Daily talk show popcorn ready? Morning everyone "🤔let us hear please we here for Hlaudi not the lawyers let's hear Mr We enjoyed curry there 
1:21,3:57, morning tlotlo Round 2 @Francel.. obviously not because his talent was probably talking a lot of nonsense over a loud speaker does the SARS commissioner have matric? why is it only blacks who are scrutinized? Yes Sestien52.....without education our understanding is very superficial "Hlaudi is the epitome of what SA is  Clown time @Brian looking at the law of averages it means that the population split is more or less 10 to 1 so it makes sence eish 
4:06,5:43, Its about to go dooooown down with the clown WHERE IS HLAUDI??? "I can't find my S Level certificate so it will always be ""Outstanding""" "We want Hlaudi "How many white Where is Hlaudi ? these people did he produce his birth certificate? or does he not have one? "is our learned lawyer friend 
6:00,7:35, "Hlaudi has an "" Outstanding""matric certificate 🤣" the commission itself is racist and anti-black. can't deal!! No the accent is not south African PLANK @Rox Moleme i doubt i hear Shonglish there THERE WAS A WHITE TSHWANE MAYORAL OFFICE COS WHO LIED ABOUT QUALIFICATIONS TOO "No rox perhaps naturalised hahahah @Glorify my thought exactly 
7:53,9:11, Thanks @Lethabo @Glorify Gumede I detect xenophobia!! really? why? "former SABC CEO was also not a south African we need a commission of enquiry about the Land that was taken from South African black people. this is a waste of time regarding Hlaudi Qualification. @Tshwane Smoke so because of that should everyone then now be authorized to lie It was a negligence Hlamza did not specifically lie about his matric lawyer shonglish What does he matter what he is? What if he is Venda? Azwindini? 
9:18,11:09, You must pay for land. it is not free nor has it ever been free. 🤡 Gave himself extra r500000 payrise pluck took fee illegally selling film library 💰 Seems like today is going to be dominated by race issues again not human beings but racists The only race I know is Fornular one... Realism @Rox Moleme and Usain Bolt racing off i suspect these will pull out like Zuma and Skhakhane hahahah formula one race😂😂😂 
11:12,12:46, @Lex Luger if he is Venda than what is the matter? If he is Shona than what is the matter? explain why is Xhenophobic that Zondo sounds Zunglish? yes to that Born Free I watched your comments over the past weeks. You are an extraordinary person that are very informed and very sensical. well done my friend didnt we pass this matric story? He was placed there to do dirty games who else was hired there without matric @makhosi No we didn't "I miss DJC breathing on that mic making those "" tswiiii "" sound" @Lex Luger you must think before making such claims i know its fashionable to use big words these days just to sound smart "@Glorify Gumede Categorising people is problematic 
13:14,14:37, Zondo ke bosso.... No video paly day what video is this? Just play the dam videos nje!! I we still on Matrix even today "@ rox moleme I thought I was the only one @Augustine Mosielele then we have a problem here "@Francel van Eeden "@Glorify Gumede Shonglish is xenophobic The bigger picture regarding qualifications means only one thing. It proves that people misused their powers to apoint their friends 
15:00,16:23, MIGHT WE ADD DA CHIEF WHIP JOHN STEENHUIZEN.. who's talking aboy him too??? why the double standards??? @Lex Luger i am of a different view and everything must be contextualised. Perhaps if you are black you will understand the word Zunglish Zimbabwean "We have a white lady working with us as a Legal Administrator with std8 Now I’m curious abt the videos I know about a lot of white people in senior possitions which were caught lieing about their qualifications. they were eventualy dismissed and I totaly agree with it @Tshwane Smoke Because the only person we see on the chair is Hlaudi. "@Lex Luger just let it go But Hlaudi is a video by himself mos 
16:23,17:52, i bet you are an armchair theorist and looking at issues from the academic point of view but that is fine 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴 "@Glorify Gumede Zunglish is derisive what's the issue if a foreign person has a working visa working here? THE POINT IN GENERAL IS THERE'S MUCH LESS ATTENTION ON THIS WHEN IT CONCERNS A WHITE PERSON @carnoth ngomane I will follow your advice and implement it with no hesitation. Thanks!!! Adv Hofmeyer can butcher Hlaudi in a sec lol Advocates is not South African citizen da comes da Zuma acts.. 
17:58,18:28, "the issue is lying about having a matric Matric story again... "heey I just came in @Lex Luger @carnoth ngomane I totally agree with you both. """To tell the truth Nothing Edward legions he does not know Legong* tuuff 
18:33,19:17, We had a president that never had even a single High school subject passed. He made a mess and we all suffer yet the population support him in his corrupt ways and blame someone else wiff @Pastor J Angibonge mfundisi wami cant even speak "i don't know what is wrong with that the media useless lol Hlaudi and Wits what does the department do? thats all 
19:21,19:53, Wits @Lex Luger Blessings. Always my friend oh shame...we are really bullying this man lol Lol Wits 😂 crapppppppppppppppp TWIT 😂😂😂🤣🤣😂 big crap ukusalayo he lectured all those clever blacks at wbs 
19:54,20:32, Wits come clean or TWEET I think WITS overreacted with that statement i agree with you Zama Now he is gonna see why he needed tertiary education not to play around with policy and dictate his own policy in News coverage. Wits Business School must come testify😂😂 He is angry if you have mba from wbs you were helped by Hlaudi he is confident though 
20:34,21:16, 😂😂😂🤣🤣 lecturer without qualifications.....n dt doesnt make him n academic Yhooooo! Lihlanya eli. He destroyed SABC So the video is for Cloudy lecturing at Wits? Media can mislead "If he gave a public lecture not lecturer i think it was a presentation guest lecture 
21:40,22:25, "he was invited for leadership presentations but bcz he never went to university and has an understanding of what a lecturer is Is the Zondo Comm. there to establish this guys private achievements? "Lecturing is teaching - he was likely invited to offer a key note The journalists they aju.... how did he end up in a position "WITS is just embarrassed and want to wiggle out of it Burning schools I think WBS should issue a formal statement on this Hlaudi the born intellectual lecture issue english guys 😁😁😁😁 
22:32,22:59, Lecturing the chair😒 So there are students who are graduates and where taught by Hlaudi answer the question @dada ngova he was head hunted 😅😅😅 Tshepesen nazo Hlaudi public lecture at Wits perhaps He lectured and they took notes 🤣🤣🤣 looku instead of look 
23:02,23:40, Is reporting the same as encouraging? and studied the notes they took Let the comedy biggin Wits must just relax His job is to interfere with affairs of SABC that is what he told us togeda 2geda @Sihle Menzi Ndzimandze 😁😁😁in their notebooks lol 
23:47,24:31, @Aphiwe Plaatjie 😂😂😂 I looked at some old Idi Amin videos on youtube last night. I feel that he has been reincarnated in this wonderful man called Cloudy. Tshepesen .......... "From memory The school of business @ WITS must be renamed HLAUDI SCHOOL OF BUSINESS the power of Twitter 😂 destroyed SABC how on earth did he end up in SABC 🤔🤔🤔😂😂😂😂😂😂 
24:43,26:00, "Defending papers Mr 90% #WBS Lecture haaaaa defending lool he is incriminating himself just like the Guptas everyone is denying working with them these days The walk is becoming tough @Zephania agree with you when i was ajuing hasn't he got interpreters 
26:01,26:58, He went overboard to protect the image of Zuma by interfering with News coverage policy. Hlaudi is more clever and smart more than most people with degreees.. I have seen stupid educated fools... @Glorify Gumede But Hlaudi killed me yesterday when he said he wanted to capture the Guptas😂😂😂😂😂 @Mpho Letheya😂😂😂😂 "Some people graduate Hlaudi you are intelligent my brother even now i get the sense why they hated you is only the fact of matric and I'm surprise that people don't talk about the position of SARS commissioner Ivin pillar @Tshwane Yamošate : maybe cleverer than you @Lex Luger lol he went as far as capturing MultiChoice Summit meeting is different with the committee mandated to create policy 
27:05,27:44, "@Tshwane Yamošate I agree he is not a buffoon @ tswane i beg to differ you are wrong """head hunted"".. pitty it wasn't returned." Cloudy said he was trying to capture the Guptas glamaratizi Hlaudi the only lecturer without matric certificate. @Glorify Gumede Hlaudi the Capturer😂😂😂 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Glaaaaaaaa RAMA mo TIZE 
27:45,28:19, "90% south African 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Hlaudi has started well here... i think underestimating this guy is a big problem. we comment like we are the ones without matric. listen to this guy and judge him based on what he says because all this other things seem to be bias Anyone who think Hlaudi is stupid has not listened to him attentively """People are shock""" msuzo 😂😂😂😂 hahaha 
28:22,29:37, You are all shocked 😳 😂😂😂😂 "@Glorify Gumede I agree But he was captured in the process 😁😁😁 "@Lex Luger He even attempted to have his own political party in parliament speaking from the heart "Arrogant whisky drinker @Maboko Shadrack Seshebedi 😂😂😂😂it was a game of who captures first but at least he knew the game unlike others who ate curry without knowing the game like Mbalula "i agree with you Glorify.. this guy knew his job  
29:45,30:58, He must return the money he stole from SABC! Zondos voice.....dammmmm 😪 he is not a liar and that is one think i appreciate about him. He gave us the name 'Swanepoel' lol "this guy just proved that matric its just a piece of paper @Carmen Hees We know you hate black people. Go play! "He was capture vele Said he liked their curry Guys I think the Matric joke is old now. Sum black ppl wr not lucky or privileged to hv gud schools. This man is intelligent in his own right. @acheem chirwa: which PhD holder is he smarter than? 
31:13,31:51, @Aphiwe Plaatjie there is no law against trying to capture the Guptas 100% no volume i like this guy lol Like a 😂😂😂true academic he has a book aphiwe he must b charged bcs he visited d guptas ? Next stop: Private healthcare and pension funds🤣🤣🤣 Hlaudi was guided by the book bathong 🤔📚📖 
31:53,32:37, I like him too @Zama Kubheka: But those people must not lead the SABC because when they do they land the SABC into the mess it's in Decision based on what? @thando cezula i agree @Sizwe Mogale all crooks are likeable including that geezer crooner @Aphiwe Plaatjie what's wrong with visiting Guptas? are Guptas the only Business people that should not be visited? It was a decision😂😂😂 He is smart but his leadership style took away freedom from journalists. the reason SABC fell 
32:52,33:54, Most academics will tell you that things can't be done and end there but Hlaudi will do and explain why a decision is taken Is there a single functioning public entity left in the ANC’s South Africa 😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 "policy "Maybe we should first clarify certification and character/skill.Qualifications are academic achievements.skills and capacity are sharpened @Lex Luger he will be a crook the day he is in court and is found guilty. Unless you know something everyone else doesn't know 📗📗🐍BOOKWORM I am irritated by his confidence as he talks....mxm! This guy isn’t intelligent. It’s just a case of the one eyed man being the king amongst the blind. @Glorify Gumede: A decision that bankrupts the SABC 
34:19,34:58, 🙄😂😂😂 his confidence is powered by ganja he took this morning "look at the people who are watching this guy and then understimate him by his matric.... this guy is a guy of practicality  "we all want money so Gupta or no Gupta all these people get bribes "Hlaudi is very grounded and respectful "Hlaudi is hopeless Haaibo Watson King of the BLind "I thought Hlaudi was unemployed... but he seem to be more knowledgeable about the broadcasting Act @thando cezula not just at the SABC but in spaces where change is needed 
35:11,36:48, There is definitely a screw loose. ANC has the Hlaudi touch 💩🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he read the book He sold SABC archives to Multichoice! He must account for that! Zuma also do not have matric and he run the country @thando cezula i know people who manipulate things including the country's currency so i won't rule out that with SABC No wonder this country is f*cked😂😂😂😂 How did he end up with an office..please help Responsible 
36:49,38:00, It’s institutions are being led by people like Hlaudi😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💩💩💩 Whatever happened to James Aguma? "Foolish instruction ""report on riots but don't show buildings being vandalised"". In TV visuals speak louder than words." He was head hunted To occupy the office Zuma ran next to the country....he never runned SA. The Guptas did.. Head hunted from where? "@Maboko Shadrack Seshebedi He was head hunted @ Maboko...hahahahahah on what bases? 
38:22,39:39, "Mr hlaudi local content ? why is this one not given the same attention got nothing to do with ANC..so calked Johnny cash Lost soul.... "What this guy did was sensoring SABC I would love to taste Gupta curry... irrelevancy Dada Haudi was an ANC deployment!? Now it has nothing to do with the ANC??! Hlaudi understood that this was beyond LSMs but economics and key to the livelihood of local people and productions 
39:49,41:37, he doesn't understand questions Well unfortunately Guptas are gone with their curry Glamoritised? Explete instructions? "This man was an ANC deployment No wonder staff were confused "This guy is talking so much BS Johnny..he was individually hand picked by some moron in the corporate hayibo The guy can't understand the questions 
41:42,42:39, This is a phenomenon that has engulfed social media in general where people will post visuals without any warning or consideration for viewers eish chairperson Zondo asking questions here is like you talking to a tree and hoping for a sensible answer pls answer the questions rather than rumbling around Hlaudi Hlaud khawuyeke ukujikajika phendula umbuzo uyeke ukucacisa matric is just a piece of paper because majority of whites have no matric but they are controlling our economy @mms s he got a bonus for selling the assets of the SABC. Coleman Andrews did the same when he sold SAA's aircraft - except he was clever Is right here @Thando Nkutha. The question is... is what he says here exactly what he instructed his subordinates? There are many many great South Africans and this is what the ANC deployed to the national broadcaster?!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
42:40,43:36, Zondo is too kind. Laughing at this guys insanity is irresponsible. must be frustrating putting questions to this guy... 🤣🤣 I agree @Mduduzi Xaba The only truth this guy has told since yesterday is curry. Akana mpendulo chair caught him in the corner Why are u always falling back between black and white...idiot "yes He is stupid but brutally HONEST. I like him for that. 
43:38,44:41, @JacquiO Orr - I think it could be strategic. Certainly not irresponsible some people are haunted by certain parties in the process delude them mxm "@JacquiO Orr That also worries me. DCJ should just chair lying is the problem "@JacquiO Orr​ 😎😎😎😎😎 @Mduduzi Xaba i know a lot of white folks owning some farms and failed matric dismally but have a lot of millions and even give me some transport when i come to school and drop me at my room Shame ANC depolyment 
44:48,45:45, he was being used this guy because he was too confident and energetic....that's why he was not even applying for jobs Hlaudi should be worried when the DCJ laughs "@yolo hahaha Judge Zondo "Hlaudi defied the odds and he became Coo despite not having matric They dont want to show black people burning diwn our vountry. ex what ? country "Hlaudi 
45:50,46:57, @Dumisani - but do they lie about it? What does Hlaudi do for a living at the moment? a lesson to allow the international world in a country @Lex😀 If this man represent “black excellence” then there’s no hope. @Pheladi - he heads up the ACM at least he's the president of something @Pheladi Lamola apparently he is shooting his own show like Somizi's or Zodwa's for channel 157. I want him to host Rea Tsotella @Johnny cash..this time i agree fully 
47:02,48:32, "I heard of Lab-dogs I thought that ACM project was stillborn @Jacqui. Johnny Stop being so insightful with the truth of our country Hlaudi came to party here!! lol....ja neh !! "Chief Justice was appointed by President Zuma and he didn't have that Matric. No one says no it was unlawful appointed shame on nepotism WMC!!!!!!! moron "@Thando Nkutha I agree we say no to corruption. But what are the chances of NPA 
48:33,49:49, There are millions of ethical talented South Africans and this is what the ANC deployed? How is it possible!!! Lomuntu uyazizwa ma ekhuluma?🤔 "Where is that guy with a stunt ""imagine it was in your mounth"" ?? is he coming to testify" hahah child @Lex Luger looking at his performance here I think I'll give his show a miss then. Moja Love must find someone else The problem is not that he is uneducated... the problem is that he is CORRUPT pleople of satafrika @funicanz 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 "Lol! if you listen to hlaudi with a sesotho war"" 
49:52,50:37, "Each of his answers talking about citizens like talking about children 🤔 Corrupt and incompetent 🤣🤣🤣 When is he going to tell us about him illegally increasing his own salary? @Mr Fridge Sandile Mogoeng doesn't have a matric? Rubbish. He's got a masters in law hahaah He took that decision alone you will have your decision his brain is disconnected from his narrative 
50:46,52:44, yes he did If his brain was 🧨 TNT he couldn’t blow his hat off. ANC appointment 🤦🏽‍♂️ He is at least is not avoiding the responsibility about the decision he took . No wonder there’s not a single functioning state entity left in SA😂😂😂 The guy is frying himself with his own fat. who is not corrupt bcoz these so called messiah they bought judges even Shamila batohi has been bought by WMC the most corrupt ppl in mzansi WMC!!!!!!! moron MSUZO Hlaudi ruined SABC to dust 
52:59,54:13, I have a problem with this Zondo Commission now! who do they want to find wrong here? the guy is taking ownship of leading the SABC @Hloniphani Ndlela What utter nonsense. Do you perhaps have any evidence thet the NDPP was bought by WMC??????? "@Pastor J when you use the inane term ""WMC"" you don't need proof..." this guy WMC was invented by Bell Pottinger. It doesn’t exist. yes she was given 1 million by CR..nd 36 judges were given cash hlaudi is having fun in this chair. Lol "HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY The only monopolies in this country are the SOEs 
54:16,55:43, @Jack Sparrow Very true indeed. alll other monopolies are illegal "in every organisation WMC was invented by Guptas so they could continue stealing this country blind. That’s a fact. Thando He couldn’t understand the truth if you hit him over head with it @Hloniphani Ndlela And that was denied by her and not proven otherwise. Does that make any sense to you? he is having fun indeed because when he saw that the avident leader is adv norman he was celebrating @Hloniphani Ndlela Fake news the reason SA MUST look for intellect and skills not nepotism 
56:06,57:31, "this commission was created to target certain people because if this was about fighting corruption and crime this guy was dumped in an office and forgotten The Commission is a joke anyways. Not a single person has been charged. Answer the question.... even in his mother language he will still rumble and rouse sis dididi "nobody says that you need a matric to have a job. HOWEVER Hlaudi is a clown I think its time to charge those found guilty already 
57:49,59:03, "eeeehhh you no che-peson black mr bean lol comedian SA can’t recover until the guilty are in jail. @Thando Nkutha My friend....Clever compared to what? Yini ngathi kukhuluma ipatient yase life esidimeni le efunde kakhulu yaze yasanganiswa yizincwadi he is leaving it to the chairperson dada Do ANC look in mental hospital 1st for appointees 
59:07,1:00:19, Johnny SA cannot recover unless the nation accepts reality Rinsponsibel?? "Hlaudi agrees with Chair's thorough explanation yet he hardly agrees with Ms Norman's questions. He agrees with everything Chair says. ""#in hind sight""" Che...che...eh eh eh eh.....this commission is going no where. "saying Hlaudi is clever is very poetic they always deny..you want to tell me someone facked bank statement on Shamila..Y CR wants the info not published..doesn't that make sense to you I think people are being hard on the guy for no reason.. At least he can give reasoning behind his decisions.. Meaning there was some thought to it The commission is trying by all means to push him to the corner...cause Adv Norman is dancing to his Tune😢 "Now 
1:00:38,1:02:37, @dada ngova As long as that reality is one where the ANC is no longer in power. "@dino ceegage it's mandate doesn't permit it to go back to 1970. doing so would be ""untruthful""" "Whenever there are visuals Not the Commission's task to charge people. Task is to hear evidence and expose potential wrongdoing. Police/Hawks to investigate. NPA must prosecute. That will happen. Commision is not time wasting. laugh Show it....but when a white man and african lady has a quarrel in the Spur...the whole world must see it. @Derek this where you are wrong..leave pointing fingers at wrong people...these things are done by individuals not organisations """Wrong or right"" ; ""agree or disagree"" ; ""may or may not..."" ???" this inquiry is just a worst of money no one is gonna be arrested..by who.?.bcoz all got their skeletons worse those who are in charge now 
1:02:45,1:04:03, "horsesh!t. An invited guest isn't a ""lecturer""" ehhh ehh ehh he got the book Hlaudi Motsoaneng is taking us for popeye's neh Wits business school turning somersaults in denial "His just failing to express himself well in english "European Broadcasts "A very clever guy....but maybe "@Ben Cole I agree with you 
1:04:10,1:06:01, @Jack Sparrow Very true. I have done thousands of sermons and written many more thousands. It will never make me the Pope. he is unable to do it even in his mother tongue "@Jack Sparrow @dada ngova Are you still peddling that old lie? The entire ANC is responsible for the mess SA is in. What about collective responsibility? You can't pick and choose when it applies. he is saying if i understand properly that what ever the chair understand is he agrees but he is still confident that what he wrote is right "@Jack Sparrow Thando Nkutha you are on point. Sometimes I think this guy is intentionally misunderstood. so even if the chair finds him guilty i wont change what he believes on 
1:06:40,1:08:35, yeh yeh yeh yeh "@dino ceegage the world has changed since 1970. we need to understand and fix what's wrong now "@Thando Nkutha Then I'm a fool. This is exactly the argument the NAT government used for their censorship of covering protests. The more things change the issue is the constitutionality of the decision.. we condemn censorship by SABC of what was really happening in SA. @ Derek this is a typical example of stereotypical mindsets SA is suffering from..blame the ANC and leave the legacy of apartheid which chained our people's progress "So hiding destruction of property from the public Seriously we watch news with kids and personally I cant stand to see gruesome visuals on TV and yes visualising distruction creates a chain of events. Look at what is happening now with the looting @Thando Nkutha It's he truth isn't it? 
1:08:46,1:10:47, The guy is too green in the judicial corridors. The Dcj is driving him to a corner. "i agree with the Hlaudi for not showing this destruction of properties. Even myself Is GNH (Gross National Happiness) as important as the GDP.?????????????????? Angeli "Hlaudi abused his position @dada ngova SA will only recover when more people use their votes wisely and don't vote for a party that is corrupt to the core and only interested in filling their own pockets. Wake up man! we heard that sir South Africans have a right to see the truth. Who are you to hide information from South Africans? by showing distruction of property is like promoting it..nd telling others to do the same when they strike 
1:11:02,1:12:14, Zozomphahlele you're on point 👌 Lol!!! hlaudi brain is so all over the show @ Derek..how do you get them to do that when inferiority complex is at play his hidding the atrocity commited by his people I differ with my counsel😊😊 "@Derek Main interestingly it seems that the DA is falling apart "@Thando Nkutha To me "Hlaudi knows his story whether right or wrong. He remembers everything and things went accordingly as per his understanding.@Thando Nkutha  Ntate Zondo ha bone hantle ha abala a roetse mahlo-a-sekhooa 
1:12:23,1:14:06, He is trying to take over the commission😂😂 this is pathetic "@H S as a South African @Jack Sparrow I wouldn't be surprised. Never trust a politician. The only thing our government responds to is a riot. "@Derek Main hlaudi calls them ""protests""" "The problem with people is when they say the following visuals are not for sensitive viewers Hlaudi avoided showing all news related to state capture not just burning of properties. educate the nation and incite paradigm shift B 
1:14:12,1:16:28, @zozo i totally agree with you some visuals do add the violence and riots to spread Adv. Norman is weak. Zondo is now doing her work of exposing the lies of Hlaudi. To wrap this up he is guilty of mishandling funds and not having the qualifications for the position. He knows the ins and outs of Broadcasting. Amen next please. The man is delusional Is it possible that Hlaudi and the ANC didn't want these visuals to be seen because they didn't want people to see how badly they were governing? Get back to the point Hlaudi Zuma wanted to break the structure of the SABC so he just lobbed this crazy-bomb into it and took cover we are led those property belongs to people not of south Africa but foreigner 
1:16:32,1:22:13, SEEMS ONLY THING THE COMMISSION DOES IS DRINKING TEA AND HAVING LUNCH...HAHAHA "@H S check the presidential inaguration Hlaudi for president Jack Sparrow ​Zuma wanted to break the structure of the SABC so he just lobbed this crazy-bomb into it and took cover - ikikikikikikikik kwaaa Niek tabl ​SEEMS ONLY THING THE COMMISSION DOES IS DRINKING TEA AND HAVING LUNCH...HAHAHA.. Do you have the ability to concentrate on every statement for hours on end? Its tough. Regime change? What nonsense! He seriously intends becoming the next president... delusions of grandeur I’d say. The problem is that destruction during protests is the only thing that makes the government sit up and take notice. "@Gee Peex1 From what I've read 
1:23:40,1:37:02, @Gee Peex1 Exactly - so then it's no longer xenophobic - it's just plain old violence. @Gee Peex1 And that's because people are frustrated - no other avenue is available to them for their grievances. It's a last resort. "@Gee Peex1 Like I've said Our views expressed about Hlaudi are subjective to the background of what is been said about him. in search of the truth you will have to use an objective mindset. When are they coming back DCJ can we proceed. "Zondo o rata dijo DCJ o shapa 6-9 too long "Am afraid we will have to wait a bit longer 
1:37:43,1:39:45, @Gee Peex1 I think you'd be hard-pressed to find many who will admit to being Nats. I disagreed with just about everything they stood for. It might explain why so many vote ANC - they are so similar. ok the man is back now SABC-had catched big fish in me - Hlaudi 🤣 here we go 😂😂😂😂😂ubenzani uComrade I heard this venue has cost this commission R13 million already since last year @Gee Peex1 I'd be interested to hear what you agreed with. This State Capture started on teh 20th August 2018. Doesnt anyone else feel this taking to long? 
1:40:17,1:42:39, "I mean its all about corruption Forever We dit bot ben the benning of property..you know che pesson 🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Quintin Middleton I strongly agree this commission is really taking long 😂😂😂😂😂 showing the benning is unlawfull "whenever a jury laughs or removes glasses to look at you at the dock burning and banning 
1:42:51,1:44:16, Is Hlaudi Motsoeneng treated with kid-gloves🤔🤔 I can't can Understand The South African Circus has arrived... the Greatest Show on Earth "@Kgalemang "you can not just decide to ""Glamouritize everything"" this man though😎🤔" Showing dying people is wrong its coz he cant digest for himself as an adult...thats why the chair has to break it down for him and semi digest it for him The banning of da Benning was for the benefit of the ANC so they would not seem ungovernable. Thanks @Nomsa Mdhluli 
1:44:39,1:46:23, Maybe he should speak Sotho......🤔 Nomsa Mdhluli ​ EXACTLY Why is the Judge entainting this clown? is this a comedy show? we need a translator now his decision not to show visuals in informed by the act. the statement read alone suggest otherwise but if read in the context of the act that governs SABC it makes sense. This guy does how to present his innocence this man must be carrying serious muti on him.. zondo has circumed to him.. Kgalemang Makgone -its coz he cant digest for himself as an adult...thats why the chair has to break it down for him and semi digest it for him "There he goes 
1:46:25,1:47:31, The man has created a new word...glamouritizing..He must have learned that from WITS students...😂😂😂😂🙈 I understand his reasons for banning these visuals the same way I understood why FIFA banned visuals of streakers during matches. Does it boil down to his lack of Matric @bonginkosi masiwa? TSHEPESEN! gee are u for real bud... Gee Peex1 hahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa would love to have coffee with Hlaudi lol hlaudi for president 
1:47:59,1:49:27, But Hlaudi just wanted to control censorship as the boss!!

He will die.....Malema will die.....what's with all the death wishes?? advocate Norman really wants to catch this fish and fry it.. he became a judgement caller and moral refree Altogether at least R10 per hour 😨

To not show protests i still submit "Hlaudi's answers are meant to confuse the commission now things are interesting he DIDNT and still DOESNT 
1:50:25,1:52:01, Mhhhhhh motsweneng Surely the Public has a right to know what is happening in their cities and to what extent. @Quintin Middleton i dont think so Hlaudi is still in Control SABC is independence This guy doesn't understand his role in SABC! "Dont the SABC have the right to cover whatever they want? I dont know Hlaudi was everything in SABC "@Born free thats your opinion 
1:52:05,1:53:04, no violent protest should be covered... we need to see he understand....it very well ...he know the his job The lack of his Matric Certificate is evident🤔 viva Hlaudi this guy is a flat footed hustler... During 9/11 the American media never showed dead bodies "But SABC may not deliberately shun covering It's a reality why hide it. But yes I agree that there must be dignity in death regarding the Benning of an individual. deployment 
1:53:05,1:54:09, HLAUDI IS A VICTIM OF NYAOPE they only reported on how many ppl died 😂😂😂😂 "I am sure it was a very difficult task reporting to someone who is always ""right""" "Who is he to decide for us what to watch and not to watch Thanks @Gee Peex1 but how do they decide whether they cover something or not? I don't want to see a person Benning Reign of terror Hlaudi's email at SABC was sabc@hlaudi.co.za 😃 😃 (#VT)

"So they cant cover it ""live""?" "Thank You blind didn’t you see bodies jumping and falling 9/11 eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh This is embarassing for the SABC

If you really want to catch the Tokoloshi just use simple primary-level english Hlaudi is a comedian that's his talent not to be a business man or heading broadcasting company like SABC "@Born free @vuyani - so you respect crap hlaudi has blind hyper confident........ 
2:00:47,2:01:43, There is so much violence and Benning that we have become accustomed to it. "Hlaudi is Bluetoothing while his speaking All I ask is that you do not allow that respect to turn into blind belief. You cant televise Zuma live on TV because he might say somthing else....that was Hlaodi point """chase them away""" @dino ceegage why are your kids watching CNN😂😂😂 He needs a fresh start n dt will be pre-shool @ Aubrey Thalane "He keeps looking at his council lol CNN
