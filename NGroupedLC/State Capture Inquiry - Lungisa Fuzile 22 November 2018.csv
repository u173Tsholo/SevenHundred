Things have really changed. No more midnight resuffles they should not take it personal 
38:06,40:50, "when the music ends Enca has better visuals @lee royal did you ask about Pretorius? it is personal if it affects ones career... screw comradeship "@Quinton Van Den Bergh Hy beskuldig ANC van korrupsie @lee royal he (Adv Maleka) is south African anyway "@1000 @Michael Mpagi @Simphiwe Dube guys apologies i was just asking @Sam Vanguard Ek het gister met Heinrich gepraat dat hy sÃª sy ouens is op die proef as hulle probeer om na die land se eksppropiasieprobleem te slaan 
41:35,46:39, lee royal we should never attack our own people for the white man to benefit "peter your tone is very condescending "have you noticed no one so far @Thando Nkutha i was just thinking what do the Zimbabweans have to do with South African matters thats all "@1000. it's not. they must admit @Sam Vanguard do you think this inquiry will bear anything other than more looting by ANC @Quinton Van Den Bergh naaa boet ANC is rotten this is a cover up by the ramaphosa faction to cover they're own tracks State Capture has been a CCMA rebellion of disgruntled employees!! lee royal why do indians and whites who are less then 15 percent run the country 
46:56,49:20, "so as he reshuffles this evening all should step down! Fuzile was trying to be professional and attempting to allays the nation and international fears about nene dismissal but gupta minister has non of this "all we have been listening to do far @Sam Vanguard waar ANC will never arrest itself from looting S.A infact the ramaphosa faction is happy to blind the average south african @Sthakathi Khumalo CCMA hearing lol. I'm getting the same sense. I particularly remember feeling the same way about Ms Phumla Williams' testimony @Michael Mpagi dont worry we getting the land back soon... "Adv Maleka is the best evidence leader @peter pott I agree with you. We are caught in ANC factional battles and the commission is used as a mechanism to fight opponents 
49:27,50:34, "@musoliwa @Quinton Van Den Bergh my only fear is EFF rhetoric lately it has been divisive in it's agendas "Simphiwe @Thando Nkutha i was just asking thats all...making sure nothing wrong with asking "it's always about the ANC "em D Exactly bro we vote because we feel bad for the ANC hope so to lee @Sam Vanguard EFF should never taste power 2019 they will turn S.A into zimbabwe remember zimbabwe in 2002? 
50:45,53:13, We listen to news because we want to know if the ANC HAS STOPPED BEING CORRUPT OR NOT everything in SA revolves around ANC Zimbabwe is fine. white people just dont want to lose their wealth @Quinton Van Den Bergh yaaa you can say that many times EFF and its's big brother ANC should be out by 2019 we no longer need such threats to our democracy Morning guys @Michael Mpagi have you ever been to zimbabwe?? @peter protocol are protocol as set out to preserve the institution integrity of course protecting one job is a secondary issue against the national issue "@van see bergh Any news on any important arrests? 
53:55,56:31, RAMAPHOSA TO ANNOUNCE CABINET RESHUFFLE AT 3PM ðŸ™„ "That will never happened "@musoliwa *give @Sam Vanguard u talk about threat to our democracy but u comfortable under the apartheid regime which was autocratic it nature. @Sam Vanguard i am with you on that one this side we going for FF+ and DA western cape we own it just wasting of taxpayer money "lies maleka is auditioning here for Wilson B Nkosi job on metro fm hereâ˜ºâ˜º 
56:38,57:52, GUPTAS invited him lol told ya!!! @Thando Nkutha white people in SA hire people from zim while we have a high youth unemployment rate and then we south africans are considered lazy...im just for empowering black south africans first SA should learn to take hash decision & arrest all the corrupt people Am lost where u r now what charges@peter ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ How come people say EFF will turn South Africa to Zimbabwean situation but the same EFF expose all the ANC shananigans @Mkhululi Bushula at least under apartheid property rights were protected now ANC wants to destroy S.A Lungisa is now lying 
58:01,59:06, "Nissan CEO in jail now so "I think they design this process to delay justice and spend more money he know who this indian person was Are u talking white property. black south africans and black people globally are in a recession Who is funding the Zondo commission? Bcs black ppl didn't own any property under apartheid "@Louis Eloff My fellow citizens Zuma wouldn't mess up if he didn't have support from ANC 
59:08,1:00:19, "Parliament lied during votes of no confidence Unathi Notshata: power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely "@musiliwa ziimbabwe is fine if anyone tell u different theyre lying @holylady1000 I think hes lying too. Looking at how intelligent he is theres no way he cant remember who invited him @Quinton Van Den Bergh yaa i can relate also to that we thought ANC under Mandela would be willing to protect our private property but now we see they wanna destroy it like the PP's recommendations that were thought to be non-binding while more billions were stolen. there's probably more new capture taking place right now All Parliamentarians are pathetic lairs @sidwel is your tax funding zondo commission 
1:00:25,1:02:16, "R56 billions wasted by government departments Lied under oath by default his body language changed immediately they asked him that question "Please chair ask him a little bit more how Mr Godongwana knew and could pre-empt what was to happen He looks like he is trying to convince them with his eyes "@Mkhululi Bushula No "there is the problem. one person is given authority. pride @Sam Vanguard black ppl did not own property under the apartheid regime. and why would a random person would raom around parliament 
1:02:26,1:03:51, why is he mumbling now? @Peter ohoo it was not easy as it was a cumulative and perceived actions by the looters which appears to be systematic. I may be wrong. Who was the Indian guy Lungile?? subtle racism or prejudice against Indians here @Quinton Van Den Bergh we should continue our community awareness campaigns against EFF and ANC dangers Zimbabwe as a country may not be trading with the world however the Zimbabwean people are fine they are working in SA and other countries "@Mkhululi Bushula Perhaps which community are you going to canvass? "cool 
1:04:11,1:05:16, This is one just reciting poetry! Who is next after this one?? well done! @Sindile Dinabantu are u refering to those native yards. Zondo may ask Fuzile how the supposed guy knew him Well done my man "hahahahaha ""am working for the gov"" and you do not know your colleague" U call that property. Hapana chatiri kuvha isu @Sam Vanguard i will continue with the community awareness against DA and ANC 
1:05:27,1:07:33, @Sam Vanguard yaa i agree this side we conduct them on sundays so that our brothers and sisters are well informed When are they arresting in the latest discovery & stop deceiving us here????? "@musoliwa You see his boss is Trevor Manuel!1 @Quinton Van Den Bergh we are intensifying our combat training and fire arms training initiatives we have seen that EFF and ANC want to try the zimbabwe road which always ends badly Zondo takes more than 4 min to ask just one question. Was it not predictable that Des was going to bring the same advisors he had whip on the of Finance and of the Economic Transformation in parliament. Any one in the ANC would have known that the South African youth are unskilled most of them work in call centers ...Our education system hasn't changed since the so called rainbow nation change happened @Thando Nkutha So you are counting @Desmond Masilela 
1:07:42,1:10:04, these pipo are very cautious of the words they utter which means they are just acting....wast of our country's time and money really @Sam Vanguard if you study the zimbabwe case you will find that the government lied to the people for the sake of colonial revenge @sing @Sindiswa Moolman. LOL NO. @Sam Vanguard we are not scared of you guys with your guns @Quinton Van Den Bergh mmmm that scenario reminds me of how i should always be prepared if the worst hits S.A which is a genocide "here is another weakness. how does a political appointee like Fuzile @Sam Vanguard Asking Israel for rifles again? @Sam Vanguard Malema and his counterparts want destroy us but that will be very hard boet i tell you very hard 
1:10:18,1:12:21, Zimbabweans are skilled right thats why ur country is in shambles and all of you ran away to crowd us here in SA @Sam Vanguard why did u run to your big brother Donald Trump if u are so prepared for any combat. @Genevieve Pilz we don't need israel for protection let alone trump or our european brothers @Mkhululi Bushula He's going to farm in the snow in Russia for ten rubles "@Thando Nkutha i see your a pan africanist however we need to solve our problem first stick to the topic mense @Mkhululi Bushula that was making the issue international as it is and your were warned Zuma messed up the country and his fellow countrymen @Sam Vanguard Men and firearms are limited surely but I guess we'll see. Hope the verbal violence in this chat in general doesn't go anywhere 
1:12:26,1:14:28, so far this process is a waste of time untill there is someone taken to jail Who is doing the sub titles ?Thamsanqa @Sam Vanguard but u said didn't need any protection. @Sam Vanguard preparation is the best boet we will stand our ground defending our families friends and property You boys are hilariousðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ "@1000 U are suffering swart gevaar syndrome. @Genevieve Pilz do you think we will let you kill us i assure we are prepared we waiting@have you ever been in a war?? but he did Peter. Power is everything 
1:14:28,1:17:46, Eish this man is divulging some points here. Lets wait for the bombs. @Mkhululi Bushula we are well protected armed and ready to die fighting against any aggression on our community If u prepared u should not be globetrotting spreading lies. @Desmond Masilela How has he been since they started this morning? many of US are responding with reverse apartheid manner "@1000 @Mkhululi Bushula afriforum or any of our sister organisations have every right to go anywhere in world to highlight our case we are suffering because white people chose not to trade with zim however the zim ppl are still working in SA now that affects us...the white people are using them in our own country @Thando Nkutha Your case of defending stolen land. 
1:17:48,1:19:24, @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU. Morning Keith. His divulging some booms and I see his still continuing where left yesterday. Through your help i now understand what type of this man he is. BREAKING! Pres. Ramaphosa is expected to announce changes (Reshuffling) later today! "@Sam Vanguard waar it's true we go anywhere to plead our case of the coming""""genocide""""" Thanks Keith for that info. what going on guys i came late "I mean here is man we ought to view as hero @Mkhululi Bushula well if we stole it what did you do didn't you steal it from khoisan and khoi khoi "I still think this commission might be just another waste of money. our law enforcement agencies are not effective @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU. Thank you Keith. Do you know what time? 
1:19:41,1:21:40, biology break "@Desmond Masilela Great man At 15h00 @Desmond Masilela Khoisans are Africans @Desmond Masilela Around 3pm i think @Quinton Van Den Bergh ramaphosa faction wants to do gamage control from the fake expose by EFF thugs @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU @Sindiswa Moolman.

Drama king We will take it back. the land was taken and was never yours in the first place.. @Quinton Van Den Bergh yaa the ramaphosa faction is becoming compromised with it's lies i see the SAPS police in uniform are they there for arrest or what? "@Tony Everts didn't the zulus There's no white genocide in south Africa there is black genocide and we are tired about it @Sydwell Phakula. No i think for protection only. @Sam Vanguard lately most black south africans have misintepreted history 
1:25:17,1:27:38, most of the afrikaners are still very racist..just not in public....but they have their sokkie braais and then the real people come out....ive experienced it Lol at sokkie braais "@Simon Collen Mthembu No black genocide either @Thando Nkutha all im saying is that if we say the world isnt trading with zim shouldnt that apply to the people from zim? we separate the two like the Zimbabwe the country can starve...its land @Sam Vanguard thats the story of your life....#it wasnt me# never.... Truth hurts you know that most white ppl never admit that they do not like black ppl "@Sindiswa Moolman Vacant positions (i.e Gigaba etc) perhaps I don't know if I have the energy for this racist chat today @Tony Everts being racist is embedded in black south africans minds 
1:27:42,1:30:19, The Chinese are very open about their racism so that's refreshing 11:35 @Quinton Van Den Bergh your entitled that is why you would say something so stupid blacks are the biggest racist race in the world it's like the world evolves around them tnx Simphiwe andibaz aba basfundekela ngomhlaba ngathi nguMkhonto kodwa sibzy ngabadli mali "@lee royal It's not entitlement. It's a combination of severe stupidity @Sam Vanguard go to Europe why are you in africa? to use our people and live better? @Sam Vanguard lately in S.A its becoming a crime to be white or indian that what you think....Its a matter of frustration to see how slow things are change...the previlage once still have it... 
1:30:30,1:33:25, .Doesnt matter what you say ....that will always be your guys mentality....Until things are rectified.... Change are coming and no matter what friends you seek over the waters...change are coming and there is nothing you can do...And you scared of the change @don't blame whites for your own incompetences or so called poverty but blame it on your fake government the ANC He maybe need to go to Australia... "@Tony Everts They only take actual asylum seekers or people with skills. Sorry @Sam Vanguard i agree ANC has poor policies How much does it cost the tax payer for a commission such as this? The problem with u white folks u don't want to be lead by black ppl u still nostalgic of the apartheid days. i AGREE

But it is not all white people. I would support someone like Musi or Obama no problem... @Desmond Masilela apparently eNCA is better? I'll have to see @Sam Vanguard Swart Suid-Afrikaners is meer as baie swartes op die vasteland bevoorreg @ Fick Liebenberg your choice of leaders is very interesting.

I might even vote ANC if they start prosecuting the VBS looters and the Corrupt leaders.. EFF and ANC want to make S.A ungovernable as they always threaten 
1:53:00,1:54:58, those protests in mahikeng really shows you how the ANC is compromised "BEFORE 1994 WHITES WERE LOOTING THUS WHY WE ARE PAYING TAX  "great work by CR in aiding n abetting WMC I would never ever vote FF+ and never ever National Party. I would love to live in a place where people are judged by their actions and their character. "@liebenberg "hi i also had a meeting with guptas  @Fick Liebenberg by what you say i think you will enable continuity of ANC RUNNING SA INTO GROUND my stream just jammed!!! mnx Now NO sound

EFF is full of corruption @Sam Vanguard EFF is promising us genocide when they govern thando like to think we're fools n can confuse thuggery by the ANC for rainbow nation. keep chasing the illusion of a rainbow both literally n figuratively while we fight for land justice politics is corruption 
1:57:09,1:59:10, @peter you r 100% on point SA is economically misdirected @Quinton Van Den Bergh never not under our watch will we allow a bunch of deliquents to govern S.A under ANC south africa is going downhill economically hungry people are angry people thats ANC playbook to use against whites please voters Cyril is our only way back to being where we were before that clown zuma took over @Thando Nkutha dont you think that once the EFF wins the first law would be to remove the white and indian minority 1st @lee royal No. They are all talk and no brains "@1000 @peter pott The best predictor of future behavior is past behaviour
