time,11:33,message 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ Zondo is learning a lot were "True. He asks so many questions zondo in anything else Zondo will be implicated in this commission Zondo was spotted in the Gupta weeding enjoying currry😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 @mbuso. You serious Everyday Zondo reports back to the guptas instead of Cyril...so they can plan there next move 
11:49,16:18, "🤣 at the ""event of the millenniu""" We are tired of this commission. When will criminal case begin??????? Taxpayers Cash Lock up Zuma Now!!!!😤😤😡😡😡 😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬 "Since his previous appearance @brutos17 Locking Zuma will not solve the problem. We need all the monies payed back I think the department's deliberately allowed the Tender validity period to expire in order to run away with the money. No criminal case is going to follow. They will recommend tighter checks and balances. Just improve the tender system. Forget about anyone being charged with a crime 😩 
16:32,20:56, trying his best!!!! he tried his best to loot from our tax money Zuma must be hand cuffed to the Witness chair. @Mbuso Ndlovu every month they push back the trial!!! locking up Zuma is the first step to getting back the U$ 29 billion he stole!!!!!😡 Zuma's must be handcuffed to a super maximum prison and key thrown away @Chad Aimes i am with you on the looting but my point is he is nowhere near the likes of Nomvula in trying to cover his a$$ Nah Zuma doesn’t have that kind of money unless you can prove it beyond any reasonable doubt lol nkosiyami lobaba kodwa Corrupt officials spend the loot quickly akazizwa nokuthi uthin uyahema nje 
21:18,23:50, the money is spread across many countries And it’s usually CASH transactions "Lying we all do not understand either The money is being used for covid relief in America 😡😩😳 @L Ll South African news will never tell you how much money Zuma stole!! think about govt spending for South Africa and the Guptas... its usually hidden in a Deutsche Bank account in Switzerland!!! "The Chair can't understand Brutos yes you are right about that What we need to understand is what is this commission going to do with all this evidence 
24:13,26:21, Nothing lol Foreign Bank accounts must be investigated. "There is no acceptable answer :pog Malema was once a Tenderprenuer before Zuma fired him Swiss banks are actually using the money to improve their economy while SA people are suffering I don't understand prisons are full with petty thieves...so the law is actually to steal big to avoid prison "Why does nobody mention Porsche SA "If I knew so little of the department that I was appointed to 
26:45,30:48, Cyril must just make more copies of R200 notes then we we all be rich😂🤣😂🤣 lol my contractor also disapeared into qwa qwa and then i was asked to complete the project after an amendment was made how much was needed to complete the work "@Canis Africanis Its still a start. If ""Cloudy"" was still at SABS *SABC Everything is yes from the lame duck Mr. Mokhesi 😂🤣🤷 these are our leaders SAA must be sold "@A Luta Continua Mokgetsi has given up. He has already seen that he has been caught by hard facts. He is now voluntarily complying with everything 🤣🤷😂 
31:58,36:12, he doesn't need to hide..he is rich and he knows nothing is going to happen to him Lets sign the petition then to change the voting system then that maimane is advocating! "Correct "@canis Africanis I am getting the feeling the ANC itself is captured and rotten from inside. even if we vote for a honourable person..its more about who the person is going to be surrounded by...the people around them "I am waiting for a moment where is going to mention his principal it aint the light bothering him. its these sins bothering him 😂😂😂😂 
36:29,40:34, 🤣🤣🤣 we said the same for previous president @Chad Aimes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Blake Yogi the irony of the light and the sins🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 canis Cyril is just another face to the ANC..but the same outfit Commissions are part of accountability. So I will vote ANC again because they account through Commissions and other gatherings @Masego 🤣 "@A Luta Continua "@Canis 
40:51,48:02, "To get SA back we need to eradicate the ANC from every decision making office in our land this is commission does not deal with accountability they just showing us responsibilty of all involved @Bonang Sithole accountability without justice is not accountability. taxpayers have been funding this commission to run for a long time and who is in jail now? true "@KgaitseweM Exactly Chad. the commision is an inquiry. they bring facts. They will send a report + recommendations.NPA will take it from there to bring accountability. So glad someone finally understands the word which goes against every definition of what a democratic country is "since the banks are clearly refusing to finance black owned emerging businesses "If only everyone understood this is an inquiry only 
48:40,53:06, "Mokgetsi is collaborating positively "@Thabo "@Fred true..its a loophole for corruption "@Eric Sithole "All in all a Tender system must be scrapped "@Thabo "@Fred "@Eric Sithole thats my problem with the ANC 
53:26,57:21, "n to add on that jai India.................................... no we don't have a black govt.we have an ANC govt..they only care to enrich themselves who are in power and gain as much as possible while they in power Jay India.................................................Jay hind Jay India "It's been clear for a long time that the ANC doesn't care about black people... thry just want their votes and bring up apartheid as a red herring every time someone exposes them Ask another question....Why are ANC cadres buying property in Portugal? It's not about race... it's about corruption... they try to turn everything into a race issue as a distraction @Blake Yogi Exactly!! All these tactics are jusr messed up Well said @ Chad 
58:01,59:20, Its always about race in this country...Do you guys not listen to the cucumber in chief of the EFF ....Ace your time has come @Visibly do you still believe anc has made this laws? Nna I think this things were written n given to anc n the same anc acted like Jet Li's n told us they wrote the laws n regulations "and yet she was eating and had a birthday party of over R100 000 and came back to confess @Kevin I am waiting for that day I tell you I see this week being a shift in the ANC and how the top brass will shine @ a b c yep. and they like blame Apartheid for their corruption Well they make everything about race but what they really care about is the money... they just use race as a diversion the race card is old news now 
59:29,1:01:02, just stinking selfish thieves ALL ANIMALS ARE EQAUL BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS is that the legacy thats gonna be left @Angelo Doubel Exactly... and many supporters just go with it... thats how ppl will view the anc "@a b c pity the bad apples really screwed up this country ANC believe they were the only ones previously disadvantaged therefore justified all the looting yet forgetting about the current disadvantaged "ANC is 
1:01:06,1:02:32, stop Radical economic looting of Zuma and Magashule "@Kevin @Blake Yogi lol... she ran out of somewhat useful things to say... it's all so hypocritical @Blake Yogi agree on the race thing "@Blake "@Blake Champagne socialists with red overalls to fool the muppets...cameras should focus on the R40.000 Tom fords & Prada's. Unfortunately the masses see this as aspirational & keep voting these clowns in @ a b c look this situation 500 000 houses was never built. R 1 billion missing. how many poor people could have benefitted. 🤔 
1:02:42,1:04:05, WE are Not in ä Point of stop blamming the past without economic equality and Land equality. "@Kevin eish there is no excuse because if I must go now into a shop and steal a packet of chips I'm going to be arrested..how is race going to be an excuse for breaking a law I wish people would see things through reality... race/gender/age whatever is just an old excuse that has no bearing... corruption is corruption Then to be equal you must pay for the land because it was not free. "and yet Action SA is something to look at @Angelo Doubel they're heartles man 
1:04:47,1:06:40, Yes. But Actiin SA needs to start promoting itself. They knew Mr Zondo yet smart enough to create sly corruption plans and so elegantly cover it up from their own cousins I shortly listened to Al Sharpton on Sun... I think his mentality is just feeding the fire... "the thing about the apartheid government was that we knew they were corrupt @Ntyab Mninw Mninw You want land.....Go earn it. You just want a handout....Chances are you will sell it ASAP to go buy yourself a mercedes benz "a nation that looks constantly to the past and alwyas blames the past "yet these anc cadres think it's ok to rob the very people that put them there 
1:06:41,1:09:16, but what's the same is that nothing could be done about corruption then and now Yeah... some people may know they're corrupt but since they benefit from the corruption they keep the ANC in power... And when they're not blaming white folk they're blaming foreigners who are here legally I don't believe the apartheid regime was ever as corrupt as the ANC. SA is very corrupt "learn from the past "I fail to understand how earning a salary of millions a year disadvantages you  1Bil = 1000 Million.......................sheeeeeeu "@Val 
1:10:04,1:11:27, sa needs to realise corruption has no color...if anything it's worse when people indigenous to our land rob their own Two different crimes. "@Continua it's not ""chances are"" they will definitely sell the land after acquiring it... I've spoken to a bunch of people who want land and they admit that they won't actually use it but just sell it" Corruption and Apartheid are both rotten and disgusting but they cannot be compared. They must be treated seperately do these people have guilt conscious in them? I mean he's probably still enjoying state's services. What the ANC has denied the poor is Crimes against Humanity. we need to sue the ANC Blake apartheid was a system yes because his innocent untold proven guilty in COURT 
1:11:31,1:13:06, do they even get arrested after but that does mean its practices were not corrupt they looted money the very same way it's been looted now Zuma was the worst door though The ANC really did this country a disservice... I think both crimes are about oppressing others "Who you going to arrest "@Val Speirs : Difference is They helped their own 
1:13:15,1:15:08, The ANC stole taxpayers money allocated to benefit the poor..that is crimes against humanity. crying about white monopoly capital while he was selling our country to foreign interest Londiwe Mncwango 😭 ANC is like a mafia... whistle-blowers are either bribed or threatened val I agree or dead gavin watson Self consciousness prevails 🎃🎃🎃 "Val 
1:15:10,1:16:38, I wouldnt put this clown in charge of my household "like we are basically owned by China and Russia due to loans zuma n his accomplices took for state purposes wish list for over 1B? سلام ھم یک غریب عوام میرئ درحواست ے ایماندار ئ کام کرئ CR is also continuing the China takeover though... The White Monopoly are the friends of the ANC just as corrupt I.e Watson and many others just like him. However the ANC is the monopoly. hello I agree val @Val great point 
1:16:45,1:20:10, anc ..... hollow promises "in our fellow black leaders Très édifiant pour moi. Merci @anchor they all a bunch of thieves Corruption is like cancer.. eventually the whole body gets affected.... "the Anc is scared now though....mashaba is providing a real alternative the demise of the anc as known is near "Mr Zondo the entire ANC has been infected...there is no alternative within its current structures 
1:20:12,1:21:45, the anc died the day they recalled Mbeki "Thanx Ramaphosa won ANC presidency "I am fearing that SA might be ruins be the time we're grand dads @ Himesh yep. I am voting Herman Mashaba. he has proven himself. CR's hands were tied.... he was the fall man لماذا تسمي الآخرين فقراء؟ هل أنت غني؟ ماذا تريد مع الفقراء؟ اذهب إلى شعبك الأغنياء واتركنا وشأننا "if you recall lol that lady upsets me...like how can u spend ur life as a doctor n be unempatic to the people of our land "when the ANC rejected him 
1:21:49,1:22:52, there's just so much hate amongst the native South Africans so much that the rainbow nation is slowly turning into a mess unworthy of looking at Ramaphosa is himself a puppet to the ANC True Chair he is holding back. He knows everything What is this agreed @Chad Aimes 700Million in Water department I do have respect for cr....he put alot on the line for the presidency "corruption where was CR then 
1:22:59,1:24:32, "But Judge  @Himesh. no other person would have had the ability to defend CR is very shrewd bug question is where is the money ppl are still without houses and their party stole it to enrich themselves big where is the people's money as we speak now. Perhaps it's in off-shore banks right now "@MW spent on lambos 
1:24:48,1:25:37, Stutter stutter. Confess baba "h but he is the lesser evil The money is long gone and not coming back evil is evil ok. I am mistaken. It is 600m + 1B. can the tax man recover it buy using what we call the shortgun we could of maybe had arrests already no Kevin politics is evil Gordaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan will have all the info 
1:25:51,1:29:11, No politics governs us... people are evil "PPL are evil he ws finance minister Duduzane and the Guptas are taking care of the money in Dubai if there was not all the race hate devide pushed out the focus would have been in the correct areas to stop such actions. SA could've been competing with other nations right now... but the last time the dollar was on par with the rand was 1987 these people must be stripped everything and must leave in a flat somewhere in Point Durban and leave on government services they'll feel the heat ABC that's also the last year weed was legal Personally I'm getting a bit tired of hearing all this race and feminist nonsense... 
1:29:15,1:32:25, "Vasie @Himesh lol 😂😂 lol I was born in 87 @Vasie. I was reading an article in the daily maverick today. the US government is conducting investigation into Guptas accounts across the world. some members of the African national Congress indeed are corrupt but not the ANC it's self .if you disagree with me please read the constitution of the anc. Angelo if the US are in then it's ON Yes you're right Nkosi... but having a constitution just to break it afterwards is a problem Hhay Vusi baba yonkinto ngeANC nje gede :goodvibes: 
1:33:05,1:34:49, @ Anchor the net is closing on them. SA will get the money back. "they not gonna get arrested these ones "that women is an insult to the strong and righteous women of our country @Vusimuzi Nkosi true but we would rather have no corruption then have have mostly corruption "@Himesh Mothi You won't see her behind bars lol "LOL. Constitution of ANC speaks of dignity for one and all. One has to first respect the constitution of the anc Another case of not practising what they preach basically... it'll probably be a saxonworld sheebeen 
1:35:04,1:38:52, Vusimuzi YET the ANC is protecting the corrupt members That makes the ANC CORRUPT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ANC don't take their constitution serious why should we read it The risk of our country facing financial problems are real "A Nation's Constitution has to match its constitution Ministers are leaving slavish life styles. While some people drink water with pigs "@RAS Allusion 😅 is the world divided by who is rich or poor 
1:38:55,1:41:33, @ RAS it's not about being educate or intelligent. But having Ingerity to lead government institutions This witness has already admitted everything. Why pretorious is wastng taxpayers time and cash?????????????????????????? "in my early 20's I was arrested along with some friends for possession of narcotics "@A Luta Continua I am just a person who shares the knowledge that has been shared with me "my life yet I accepted it cos I was in the wrong as well "@Angelo Doubel  hello "Himesh..you can apply to a court to have your criminal record expunged after 10 years @Himesh Mothi Don't cry for a spilled milk 
1:41:49,1:44:56, "Likewise I know of a case in the US a few decaded ago where a guy was thrown in jail for 10yrs for stealing a chocolate... he was still waiting for his actual trial But they forgot about him @a b c Unbelievable Recent British financial grant to SA Solidarity Fund- from white capitalits.. Will this be accepted by politicians and their parties. Heh Cruel world cousin... poo0 poo0 "it's not crying 
1:45:28,1:48:07, "If you believe that you work ten hours a day in a farmer's field and you shall be paid for all ten of those hours you willingly work every individual needs to be equal in the eyes of the law In America being arrested is a fassion @Himesh 100% agree... special treatment shows that the world just ain't fair... In american prison you eat a very nice food Food that you cannot afford outside even here in South Africa Mr Ndlovu "this whole idea that anc cadres are special cos they fought apartheid is bs Generally yes... but some prisons are full of human rights violations 
1:48:19,1:50:06, American prisons are Hotels "Governments have been hijacked by factions benefit over the many others that sacrificed as well Weed is legalised now therefore any prior convictions or criminal record for possession of a small amount of weed for ones own use..should be expunged. "so suppliers were not approved hi val it's not state law as yet They were all aboard the gravy train. :sanitizer::sanitizer::sanitizer: Government controlling the means of manufacture/delivery (production) us COMMUNISM! It has never worked anywhere it has ever been tried. It always crumbles under its own weight.

Yet the people in power can ignore them at their will Will JZ appear on 9 Oct. Or is he going to Cuba for treatment zuma had it set so non of this would have been admissible in court The DG's evidence is meant to deflect and implicate the junior officials who were dismissed and the then DG redeployed to the municipality "Who on earth pays for something that is not agreed upon? and still has the audacity to wear a suit & tie (ala Malusi Gigupta)...Chucking out all my ties and suits.
