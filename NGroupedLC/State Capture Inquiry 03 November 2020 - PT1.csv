time,-13:39,message Who else thinks yesterday was lit That lawyer lady lacks decorum. Backyard lawyer. Jirre would not want to be her husband. She makes no sense in her arguments at some stage I felt shaim for her maaaan . But they really have it in for Ms. Hofmeyer. But she stood her ground well. Hofmeyer is well grounded and articulate """lotshani bakhozi !! let us accept dat by pushing the likes of mev.vetkoek paleis in top- notch positions we shot ourselves in de brain """ Loool """ we embraced mediocrity(mediocre) & frown upon meritocracy ( merit) """ 
-11:56,-3:33, Yes both the CA and Liar (a.k.a Lawyer at times) are both highly qualified. The high comes from the college being on the 12th floor of an abandoned building in Hillbrow.

26:38,27:42, @Tshedza Munyai Kwinana looks at Kate with hate in her eyes @ Musa Mabunda Indeed and their difficulty is that Kate asks direct and relevant questions. They get exposed.
