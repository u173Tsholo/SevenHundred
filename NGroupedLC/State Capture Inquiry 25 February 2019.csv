42:22,52:06, Got stuck now. "Eslon we can't relax Eslon Eslon Sorry the Koko story The ANC and it's cadres have become eye wateringly rich while the country becomes poorer and poorer. Waiting for arrests and expulsions from the party. Tjooo trillian No difference between ZANU PF and ANC and yet the masses will still vote for them Edwin Mabelane was at one point a CEO for Hendrina Power Station @ Walter Du Plessis it is madness I know 
53:03,58:18, @Dane hlasi .....same difference bet ANC and ZANU-PF....lol and when the country colapse they all want to run to the Europeen countries This needs to be fixed. People have to boycot ANC just like they boycoted Zuma "mara Jirre Most Anc voters dont understand these things its through mobilisation they will understand "Yes we will vote for ANC giving them last chance if they blew it it‚Äôs bye bye last chance? its been 25 yrs dude Now they tried to fix it so that whoever comes there no more looting including to sitting president @ makhosi nobhatyi eish you guys don't learn 
59:11,1:02:10, so the country must collapsed completely before reaction from the voters? it looks like it how about showing them now that this is unacceptable and bring them back later "just remember stay there and vote the cancer out only irrational voters would vote for ANC after so many years of looting. "I understand where we come from @ Joel Mzayidume agree It is really ieeational and irresponsible honestly Same thing happened in Zimbabwe 
1:03:19,1:06:53, our country is going the direction of the rest of Africa with so many corrupt grandpas and grandmas in parliament so is that not enough to show them that you are not stupid @ Makhosi Bhayi we are going into right direction now. the fact that this commission it is opening our eyes most of criminals they will afraid now to loot for our government "i heard from a black gardener the other day that the ANC steals so much so that when the whites take over Hope Tribunal established by the president will expeditiously and swiftly act within constitutional nd any legislative framework to redeem our economic and social position. "it is not true I still have no trust on the ANC. Betrayal of the TRUST. zondo commision is doing well to expose the wrong doing but we some serious bite with the bark lets wait for the recommendations from this commission after they are done 
1:07:32,1:12:06, "could we please not entertain race here "Khumalo just wait remember ex president broke ssa Nobody in their rigght mind will vote for ANC full stop The ANC corrupted the whole country through cadre deployment. African leaders are all the same They're not to be trusted. ANC needs Jesus not votes Why is it that Africa is not going anywhere? @ Makhosi he was protected by the whole ANC cocus including the present president so what does that tell you 
1:12:36,1:14:51, i think all ministers and deputies must be fired and new ones must be appointed. our major problems in Africa are our youth who refused to do the right thing Giving ANC the chance is suicide. Africans prefer suffering and smiling @ Walter Du Plessis It is governed by Idiots and Greed Anc is the friends n comrades of corruption but enemies of progress n enemies of developments our leader's don't care about the masses @ Walter as much as it is painful to accept this but i have to accept it/. We are dealing with selfish dogs "@khumalo I hope you would accept that Zuma was playing his card carefully doing right decision behind processes that is where he enriched himself 
1:14:51,1:17:26, who are not worthy to be rulers. Most importantly not forgetting western interference Tragies!!! Judge Eh-eh-eh-eh Zondo mors tyd & belastingbetalers se geld!! Die gedurige uitstel is onnodig as hy net wil rigting kry¬∞¬∞¬∞ Without concrete evidence "I wish if this type of Zondo Commission if not himself Stop this inquiry. It is a waste of time and money. Ppl need to be arrested. Everything is expensive due to the looting by ANC Khumbuzile is right race issue is so irrelevant here "Why does Zondo remove reading glasses when he reads? He reads better without them let the commission give us more looters 
1:19:25,1:21:41, the whole cabinet of JZ was corrupt to the core You may be angry now but one day you will cry once any party comes these many rights we have will be destroyed how did I get here @Bridgette Kekana 80% of that Cabinet is Ramaphosa's Cabinet today "@Nelson Musoliwa  The majority of people are so used to poverty they dont even know they deserve better that is why they keep voting for these mafias who are incapable and incompetent CR is going to remove all the wrong doers yes so very true can we please stay away from race please 
1:21:51,1:23:12, This guys are clever .One day we will hear that Zondo commission was another means of getting money of government corupt means.South Africa open your eyes @Bridgette Kekana when? Our leaders dont care about us. What they say needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Some people believe it's okay to be poor on earth. They anticipate better life in heaven. that is why the wrong doers hate CR @ Bridget Kekana CR is the worst of them all. Wait until his crimes surfaces CR knew what was happening and He did nothing !!!! @ Brigdette nothing is going to happen trust me. Who has been at least suspended in the light of all this masness? just onr? As well a BBE is meant to correct and balance business - it is the root cause of the countries corruption it‚Äôs so evident on the Tenderpreneurs ! 
1:23:41,1:25:03, @Joel after the elections CR knew what was happening and did not stop it. So that makes him part of the problem! Zondo Commission got security surveillance from BOSASA company.. The BEE needs a bottom up approach. All I wish is Bathabile Dlamini comes here to explain what she means we must forgive state capture as we forgive apartheid error does she know something or she was a beneficiary of this? President Ramaphosa is doing a lot to fix South Africa "CR is in the same gravy train Brigette Kekana .. CR is cut from the same cloth.. as he knew all along the wrong doing in the ANC.. but remained quiet... Corrupt as all Cyril removed the controversial head of SARS 
1:25:17,1:27:22, Le Raux SA need people to manage it purposefully for development no matter who the president is; race can not define and shape our destiny. CR is still ANC and has been for 25 yrs "CR  @Mzalwane Mzala .. what does that make CR ??/ a saint Crap... "CR was forced by court judgments to do what he is doing. Let us thank civil society groupings Cyril is capacitating the criminal justice system "@Nelson Musoliwa  CR is a public relations man...pretending to be different but really cut from the same ANC cloth "Guys open your eyes and start thinking deputy has less power than president and he will seem like waiting to take over by President supporters n fired 
1:27:38,1:29:36, @Mzalwane Mzala ..you missed out the in... No enlightened and mentally stable being will vote for ANC. Period! Cyril ensured that the post of the head of Hawks have been filled look at the Jabu Mabuza guy now...he maintains 30% of Eskom boilers...the rot continues under CR Le Roux i am happy that there are people like u lets canvass this as wide as possible to keep SA cohesive for the benefit of all SAns. The fear of losing elections is the only thing that spurred the ANC into doing what is right. For years they have been sitting on the rot.Go ask Dr Makhosi Khoza. CR was part of preparing the constitution and when Zuma broke the constitution he defended Zuma. Now south Africans must him another chance? a big NO!! South Africa is stuffed because race plays a big part "After many years without leadership in criminal intelligence 
1:29:44,1:31:51, Which McKenzie they are talking about? is that coloured guy? @Solly Mothabela ... you on the money.. well done @ makhosi nobhatyi i‚Äôagree with you waiting for a right time CR never attended Mandela's inauguration. Why? "Mzala i agree with you he is trying to redeem the country from shambles President Ramaphosa has suspended people who are accused of corruption in the NPA. "Now you talk as if there is problems with Ramaphosa "CR has now establish a special unit so implicated persons can go to jail "@Joel Mzayidume Cyril Ramaphosa and all ANC minions voted against all votes of no confidence against Jacob Zuma 
1:31:51,1:35:25, when ever a white person is appointed to a high position there is a hugh outcry from black people President Ramaphosa has established an inquiry into the fitness of two top NPA leaders who are alleged to have acted wrongly. @Sandile Khowane kufana konke lokhu kwamakhehla nezalukazi. aba voetseke ngikhathele! yes but to rescue ANC before elections you are correct @ Andre There was aCEO appointed and there was a hugh outcry President Ramaphosa is making sure that no SIU report is not acted on for 10 years after it recommended prosecutions like it happened in the case of Bosasa. "President Ramaphosa has set up a special tribunal to adjudicate in these corruption cases. Quick 
1:35:51,1:37:47, Ramaphosa can‚Äôt change everything at once he must follow procedures fair and transparency to everyone once all this vecant post fulfilled and you will see surprise people will be arrested "@Mzalwane Mzala meanwhile @ Thando Nkutha CEO at DENEL Did you know that Leshabane Papa an ececutive of Bosasa is friends with Zizi Kodwa... best friends buddy? "@Mzalwane Mzala your President protected Zuma at all cost on all Votes of No Confidence @Joel Mzayidume She still have to attend the commision @makhosi nobhatyi what procedure does he need to follow to fire corrupt ministers? please tell us "to recover the money and seize assets makes them guilty The likely person to have leaked NPA documents to Bosasa was suspended last week 
1:38:13,1:40:57, @ Thando Nkutha RACISM "Special leave as he did to moyane @ Walter please lets not talk racism today Ncukaitobi is in the house. Legal Mind another beast! Black excellence. @Thando Nkutha there is a outcry because he is white.Maybe we need more educated people running the Public sector Best of the Best 
1:40:58,1:42:44, ‚úäüèø‚úäüèø‚úäüèø Racism is not what most people understand it to be. it is far deeper than that love that guy .. One we can be proud of. ‚úäüèø "@Sandile khowane I think Nobatyi has answered thi CR17 at that time he was a deputy pres Hi everyone Like i said before when the country colapse don't cry refugee and run to europeen countries ‚úä‚úäüèª‚úäüèº‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèæ‚úäüèø @Joel Mzayidume Ministers serve at the pleasure on the President if the President was to fire one he doesn't need to explain him/herself to anyone. 
1:43:11,1:45:39, Vote for who you like @Lungisani Ntshonga . I'm tired of voting for perpetual promises @Lungisani Ntshonga power to do what? to vote No in Parliament? come on now we're not stupid. you can be proud of yourself no matter what colour you are I'm amazed at people who have access to information continuing to vote for crooks. after 25 years. I forgive peasants who have little access to information. hi and welcome @ Rohan JZ was not educated no formal education but he was the prez @ Thando Nkutha IT'S IN THERE GENES TO LOOT AND STEEL.lOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A TRUCK OVERTURNS .wHO IS LOOTING ...just don't be corrupt!!!! @Walter Du Plessis you are now defecating through your mind 
1:45:58,1:48:36, thanks @Khumbuzile Khumalo . What's happening so far? Any damning evidence as yet? Some more people implicated? "@ Walter @Walter Du Plessis i can't believe you can be so ignorant "@Joel Mzayidume it madness No i'm not.Its all over social media .Check who is looting @ Sandile Khowane like i said it's in their genes Look at Africa and tell me who is looting Too it's a major Genetic Defect that will exist for all time.. unfortunately "@ Rohan 
1:48:48,1:51:37, "Koko had lots to say with his first hearing outlined "@Walter Du Plessis that is totally uncalled for üò§ you are quick to speak about race @ Walter its not in the genes but in social structrues of this world Yet the biggest looters in the state capture inquiry is a white guy known as Gavin Watson Is Zizi not here today? thank you @ Rohan I have been asking people to stop with race "@Walter Du Plessis Corruption is not genetic now African countries benefit from foreign countries mining interests its just unfortunate that the African governments are looters. 
1:51:46,1:55:21, You are correct since the 1700s then you must find out why? @ Walter "Walter Du Plessis crime and corruption has no race @ Thando Nkutha i have travelled Africa and has seen a lot. I visited Australia and they have problems with Sudanese gang robbing and looting @ Walter that is why our saying racism is not what most people understand it to be it is far deeper than that White people are not the government of any African country. I would suggest you mngomezulu if you are man don‚Äôt laugh coz I have many questions Africa is a disaster Grow up @Walter. Anyone can use facts or make up facts without any convincing proof. 
1:56:07,1:59:04, They don't do it on a scale we see in Africa Really? @ Walter? morn ing. 3!. "I just have 1 question for everyone on this chat. We are dealing with the state capture @ Thando Nkutha tell me what i have said is not true!!!! It's facts colonisation was safer for all I am a realist @Walter Du Plessis we are you from? 
1:59:10,2:01:18, @Walter. Very one sided false statements "There is no truth in your statements No it's not it is all true .Go and google and you will see the facts hi and welcome @ cheryl Not everything you read on Google is true. @ Khumbuzile Khumalo it's in your face .You cannot ignore it @Walter Du Plessis very naive. @Walter You have one finger pointing at others and 4 pointing back at you and your cohort you associate with Go and also google how racism was structured against blacks in the whole world by white supremacists 
2:01:30,2:04:35, well if the truth is racist then yes Racism is a personal choice it exists amongst all fabrics of society. Mabuza is sent to smear Koko but angeke alunge @Walter Du Plessis Never apologise. Koko is finish Realist people @rohan barnard I noticed your question was not answered üòâ @ Val. that is a lie. Racism was structured and black people can only hate the process but cannot do anything about it so just stop with stupid ranting agree Thando 
2:05:17,2:10:28, "Mabuza Those whites are part of the cadres. And must be dealt with Sthakathi Mabuza was sent by Pravin and Mnchunu to smear Koko "In our democratic society Thando - it‚Äôs not western it‚Äôs Eastern China all over Africa ? Well said @Anne Please... back to the inqiry mandisi ntauzana I am really trying to comprehend what he is saying and the relevance to everything and yes it seems that he is on Kokos case!! My BP is up... 
2:10:31,2:13:56, Matshela Koko has some explaining to do...i can't wait for him to appear before Zondo Thando you should care ? If you mine minerals you have to sell them globally ? Why is that looting ? Think about it I agree all those involved must be dealt with. I certainly hope that Gavin Watson will be extradited from the UK to face the major part he played in the crimes. I mean emails can't be wrong - BLACK AND WHITE right ? Tetris Molefe stuff!! @Thando Nkutha It doesn't matter Zondo will call him and Adv Maleka will grill him The sad thing is that koko emails were not part of parly enquiry. He can easily deny that this emails were doctored Thando you made a bias comment about Westerners looting Africa - I just corrected your perspective - glad. You are here for the right reasons as all of us are @peter pott forensics can investigate that claim 
2:14:42,2:15:53, "@Joel "But Malekas accent is beyond phenomenal what is the real truth about Loadshedding ? he is only mentioning Koko because the new board suspended him. he was the only 1 the new board suspended this board has been in office for a year. They fail badly and they were exposed of not knowing what to do Absent of skilled people including you haha what happened to inscriptions Coal is being diverted to Mozambique Loadshedding is due to incompetence at the top of Eskom. no other credible story 
2:16:50,2:19:20, @peter pott you're right. none of the current board know anything about power generation Hi @Sofia Sofia üòÄ "koko got his sins. but he was and still is an engineer who knows much about electricity. shame here Why they can't just consults with brain and Koko instant of bringing people from overseas All the qualified engineers were forced to immigrate.. that's what happened to Eskimo. Can the witness put more than 2 sentences together without saying ‚Äúeeeeh‚Äù? "Brian was there WHAT is he was not fired ? Would he still be here spewing out evidence ? He is searching for the right word üòÇ 
2:19:24,2:22:46, @Sfiso Nguza you're right @Neil Fraser queens language is a hussle for some of us Sorry if i sounded racist but there are big problems with our black communtities. They will have to deal with it because it is destroying South Africa Or just habit as he seems quite confident Brian is every where even at Prasa his name had been mentioned "@Felix Muyoba eeehh.. then you should please @Thando Nkutha loadshedding began 2008. where were the Guptas then? I'm off to my CIC Julius Malema addressing live The Guptas came long bfore the the death of N Mandela 
2:23:11,2:32:08, @Joel - the guptas were working through Salim isa the guptas were background singer for many years... laying down the law for zuma They were introduced by Essop Pahad exchange their expensive suits to orange overralls hahahaaaa Did someone say Zondo subpoenad Koko already? Koko is a crook n she looks innocent @Bridgette Kekana it's worth waiting for his testimony. Prejudging him will not help you. "Is it conclusive that ""the businessman"" is Salim Essa?" these thugs must be stripped of their assets and money 
2:38:10,2:44:37, Ouch "Dane hlasi @Bridget kekana Koko is a guy not a lady Ouch! SABC what are you doing with the sound?? YOH!!!!!! Adv Pretorius is back...Agrizzi's man what wa mabuza doing as the chair when this mess was happening? What happened now to Maleka? "@Joel Mzayidume yes Hi

I just ordered Nando's @rohan barnard media seriosly!!!!!!!!!! su! @Thando Nkutha ok thanks. Did someone say he's only coming next month (i hope next week)? ok thanks @Thando Nkutha 
2:48:10,2:53:33, up* üêî+üêì+üê£ LOL @rohan barnard üòÄ O Brian Molefe as well? Yo kshubile Kipp Brian Molefe is a cry baby Thuli Madonsela solve him @Joel even at Prasa Brian had been implicated I want to see Brian Molefe at this commission 
2:54:12,3:01:22, The whole eskom board should be on the commission But why is he not speaking from his knowledge rather reading emails. e Eskom ese mazibene üôäüôà "I think Mr Mabuza is the man who will turn Eskom around @James Godloza Godloza Mabuza has said it in public that he is not competent to deal with loadshedding so I'm not sure where your argument is coming from. I ask the QUESTION AGAIN ... WOULD he testify if he was NOT fired ! ? So Bosasa IT department has a contract was this very commission of inquiry "Mr. Jabu Mabuza is exposing a lot OR am I wrong and he really is honest ? 
3:01:28,3:05:19, "He became chair of Eskom only last year He is be g questioned in what he found not what he did @Sofia Sofia that's what I'm thinking as well. Like is he only testifying because he no longer works for Candlekom? @rohan barnard CANDLEKOM LOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Joel my friend all I'm saying is that little element does not sit well with me i don't see how a father could not support his son and or the business he has started himself that's all The evidence is not given in a vacuum...there are affidavits produced by them before testifying i am happy with what i am seeing here Thanks for the cleanup president Ramaphosa 
3:05:19,3:07:04, Judge Zondo explained last week that they are dealing with the gaps of the portfolio committee hearings ok i get it @James Godloza Godloza . i also agree he has declared his wife's son is involved in mining and he does not sit on meetings that involve coal This is not a whistle blow this is vuvuzela Cashkom ... their personal ATM ... lol it' not his blood relative although he has brought him up as his own @Bridgette Kekana Vvvuzela üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£ #imdead !!!! I don't think any one has competent to deal with loadsheding unless they deal with corruption first This man must also go to jail 
3:07:06,3:09:26, Evidence is led from the affidavits produced by the people being questioned who is the boss? the boss Zuma Boss is aj Gupta zuma ESKOM was already bankrupt in 2015...this man could not have done a miracle I a few months to turn it around.The damage was already done and escalated to the billions of debt it has now Bridgette ü§£ Boss at Dudu MyeniZuma It must be put on record it ws not bankrupt 
3:09:31,3:10:50, "President Cyril Ramaphosa has in terms of Section (2)(1) of the Special Investigating Units and Special Tribunals Act 74 of 1996 ANC killed n stolen the money n now they want us to believe they have solution to fix He explained what he found last week...ESKOM was already in fast deline How do the legalities differ with a commission? *decline The establishment of this Special Tribunal is occasioned by the need to fast-track the finalisation of matters that the SIU refers for civil litigation following conclusion of their investigations. Mzalwane? true @Makwa Choma These are matters where the SIU would have referred to civil litigation contracts entered into by state institutions to be declared irregularly invalid or set aside. 
3:11:17,3:13:43, @Mzalwane Mzala Yes "my friends if at any point I have the right call or assume that those we have the interactions with via this channel are my friend's Ok. And criminal charges? "Commissions They bankrupted the whole Fast-tracking these matters will enable the SIU to recover monies and or assets lost by state institutions through irregular and corrupt means. But after lengthy court cases? "It will They bankrupted the country sudden we must trust them again 
3:13:45,3:14:31, The Special tribunal Ok. So it should be less lengthy "If SA was a desert the problem i have been struggling with for almost ten years now anyone who have business experience and or know how to get funding clean funding for a startup mushroom farm please WhatsApp me on It is meant to avoid the lengthy court cases ? Wow EFF won't steal.....ha ha ha ha ha @Makwa Choma this chap is playing leave him. 
3:14:49,3:16:18, The litigation process includes both public and private sectors persons and entities. Thank you mzalwane mzala u sound like u hv hope in it only an idiot could trust anything the anc would say @Makwa they bankrupted Prasa Saa Transet the list is endless True Joel nor do its like Hawks everyone was hyped up amd where the Hawks scorpions? nxa @Sendo Sityebi The majority of South African voters are probably 'idiots'. Be careful of isnults we are no longer fooools even a blind man can see "@Bridgette Kekana..Denel 
3:16:18,3:17:13, Cost plus mines... real capture!! insults "ANC will give u hope until u vote I can lead the eskom to light @Mzalwane Mzala thinks we were born yesterday. to vote ANC after so many years of corruption would be sick Joel shuddup anyone please James Now you can see ????.....so you now vote EFF ???.......kaboom !!!!!! 
3:17:14,3:18:14, well if count me out of thise stupid voters then Wassup you shut up lets form our own party ü§£ why did eskom not buy the mines. At least they would have saved money @Bridgette Kekana what will we call it ? The powers and functions of the Special Tribunal are to adjudicate upon any civil proceedings brought before it by a (SIU) in its own emanating from the investigation by such SIU. The Mines party 
3:18:18,3:19:23, "3 pit toilets for R4.6 millions tender andre how can they wen wat the anc eyes are on money Such civil proceedings will be based on the outcomes from the investigations by SIU. @Sofia we will decide n vote for me pls So the evidence is done.and assets can be determined and attached? The Daily Maverick published all the Gupta emails...the two whustleblowers who did the expeet cyber investigation are now in hiding fearing for their lives "true "Vote EFF....free farm "Don't be fooled by their empty hopeful wishes 
3:19:31,3:21:18, greedy ANC @FunaniüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ @Andre greedy ANC individuals mzwanele go preach to fools like u i aint no fool to be played by anc cz ramaposa is not in charge of the anc @Talloolah Moon The investigation is done by the SIU just like in the Bosasa matter where the SIU in 2009 already but the NPA did not prosecute until 2019. This changes that EFF ..... VBS was a mistake? But then that‚Äôs longer Oh. Sorry Lets put our hope on CR 
3:21:22,3:22:17, "Yes.....they were hungry THe ANC also to blame for covering for them ‚ÄúThis changes that ‚Äú "Eff doesn‚Äôt have any kind of leadership It is quicker as opposed to what is happend with Bosasa Yeah. Gotcha SO ANC can say ... It all was a mistake We live in hope "Factions fighting and exposing each other is wasting our time 
3:22:26,3:24:19, We will no more have a situation where SIU investigations are frustrated like in the case of Bosasa 9 years wasted........not Jacob or ANC fault.....Jan van Riebeeck was the cause of the looting "@Chris Bard Remember during Zuma‚Äôs term we didn‚Äôt have the President of the ANC and the country @James Godloza Godloza mushroom farming is an easy job. You just get to need the spores and horse dung. Literally. My uncle farms with mushrooms The special tribunal have been set up. If you vote EFF.....everything is free Cupcake is unable to sort out mess that he is swimming in.Remember Marikana ANC wil;l get you on your feet again.....they will steal your car

Judge Sirajudien Desai Rohan not that easy my friend i have been growing mushrooms for nineteen years now 
3:27:23,3:28:28, @Talloolah Moon Criminals will always try to defeat the system but that does not mean we should not act "Chris obviously u wont like Malema how long will Ramophosa last as the President of SA..???????.. @kabelo for ever President Till elections Two terms according to the policy of our movement @James Godloza Godloza small scale or commercial? You should be able to harvest weekly andre gerber and then they fools like mzwanele mzala who enjoy seeing ppl suffer cz they are well provided by the anc how stupid should u be to trust even a hallow frome these looters the SIU have already investigated many matters but there has been no prosecution. The special tribunal addresses that. 
3:28:34,3:29:34, Of course. Thanks for your help in this understanding ANC stole so much they can't even pronounce it.....7Trillion and elfty twelve +two hunded and cents Awesome.
