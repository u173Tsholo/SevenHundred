"@Angelo every corner you see shacks going up "@Mzalwane Mzala mminib its cool here in Klerksdorp The EFF contested all the wards (96) and won 0. Still the EFF was not the biggest looser. 
37:27,40:56, @Mzala yes let the ANC voters vote for them again and keep living in squaler. seems like they love to suffer so I have no sympathy for them when they cry about their living conditions. @ Valencia J don't u think SA in the most unequal society? There is big gap between rich and poor. Because the EFF had nothing to lose? 😂 @BanditZA GM @ALTA 🙏🏽 Valencia do you see me i greeted you earlier @Mzalwane Mzale who won the most wards? GM Dames and gents of the jury @Tom GM

Wonder if his health will hold to take his flogging. SanFran... thanks... trust that you doing well @Valencia J Surely one can use ID numbers to identify those previously housed at the states cost? Valencia j if you talk about it then you are branded a racist "@Nemabubuni Geoffrey yes thanks @Angelo Doubel I think the real story is the downward slide of the DA. @tommygun how if government officials are so corrupt. They are paid to be corrupt. Believe me people don't get caught and we the middle class keeps paying 
45:46,48:42, Tommy gun money talks @Mzalwane Mzale okay. so the DA is in second place? @Angelo Doubel The DA lost most wards @Mzalwane Mzale people are tired of the DA "Dlamini-Zuma details South Africa’s updated level 1 lockdown rules... keep updated and safe Al Jama-ah took a ward from the DA in Johannesburg :yt: "@Mzala did you also mention DA took alot of anc wards? I heard they lost alot and numbers has decreased alot @Mzalwane Mzale I think in Lenz

This is no longer about me or us ANC : Shaka Zulu created the Rooivalk I think Mr Burger is the next witness today @Valencia J There is a real lack of a decent party to vote for in SA @Valencia J I did not mention that because it is not true. I don't tell lies. @Piet Vast 🤣🤣🤣 @Sherwin Peters yes he is "I wonder why SABC is running two streams "@Mntase o was going to ask now 
50:12,51:58, The Freedom Front Plus took a ward from the DA in JB Marks (North West). @SanFran that's going to be fun... eish Mzala they so small will have to go into coalition with ANC or DA "@Mzala maybe you should do your homework thoroughly. I know you hate DA and trying your best to bring the bad news @Sherwin Peters yes indeed. I just hope Adv. Kennedy is on fire as he was last night. @Bandit ZA it's deal they made with Telekom anyways enough about these useless parties. Let me concentrate on commission 😉 I am looking at the IEC figures. You can name the ward or municipality @Valencia J ANC = corruption 
52:03,52:40, ANC = EFF guys the only way to vote ANC out of government is to start winning the municipalities. then they must start repairing the roads and clean up the towns ... ANC = starvation ANC = sun standards This commission is now boring.. "I do not doubt at all ANC = SUB standards ANC = LIES 
52:44,53:19, ANC = murder in that way people will see that things are moving for the better @Mzalwane Mzale so DA is the biggest loses 😂😂😂 ANC = political prisoners commission is not here to entertain you ANC = theft ANC = RACISM ANC = oppression yes Adv. Kennedy we want to know 
53:19,54:01, ANC = fake struggle double I wouldn't rely on mzalas info. Rather check for yourself Tooth fairies need to be investigated for stealing coloured people's teeth. ANC = deseases @Freddie van Rhyn and fix the potholes "@Anti DA - it is not as fiery as with the other work streams ANC 1$ 15 Rand @ Valencia J well stated 👏👏👏 ANC = Corruption 
54:08,55:28, ANC = load shedding ANC = plagiate 'science' Alta that's what I meant by repairing the roads @SanFran Arnold - I see...who is the toughest lawyer? ANC = mass murder African leaders fail to resolve conflicts and problems because of greed. ANC = child molestation ANC = HIV ANC = corruption 
55:29,56:33, @Anti Da will soon be blocked This Piet guy is a troll? "@Anti DA - They are all tough ANC= its not me ANC killed Sidisu Magaqa ANC killed Stompie ANC= I cant Remember @Nemabubuni Geoffrey for sure. 👍 Thabo mbeki was the best African leader @SanFran you are correct. They all have different strategies and so far; they have all done a great job 
56:36,58:03, ANC is Shiiiiiiithole @Freddie van Rhyn yes i know but some of the potholes are so big you can actually plant a tree in it @SanFran Arnold - Is it true that these lawyers are getting paid 36000 per day? ANC = corruption if we cannot convince ANC voters to vote for another party. then let's convince them not to vote ANC. every vote that does not vote for ANC and abstains is a vote for opposition ANC killed Sindisu Magaqa morning all!!! Just block the Piet Vast guy. He is just trolling. ANC threatened to kill Thuli Madonsela 
58:26,1:00:00, GM melds melds ANC constructed the 'Boeremag' from A to Z ANC = death cult ANC = 'normal crime' Pravin* @Freddie Van Rhyn That will not work if the opposition implodes like the DA is doing now. The DA lost 4 wards to smaller parties. 🙄🙄🙄 when will Ace be making a guest appearance? ANC = SACP 
1:00:08,1:01:30, Piet has had enough! 🤣😂😅 it is really sad to say our African politicians use their struggle credentials to stay in power for too long while looting the resources of their countries. "@Anti DA - Pravin is back 30 Nov. JZ Monday. The evidence leaders are mostly SC and some are acting Judges An arrest warrant has been issued against Ace Magushele. @Anti it isnt an enterainment channel. Listen to the info and follow it you will then understand why Senior Counsel is so pricy Malema : Never an own political party.......CORRECT EFF = ANC @Blake Yogi totally agreed PIET VAST is in love with the ANC Cannot wait for stephan burger 
1:01:44,1:02:59, FF Plus is dealing with the DA "The problem we have with voting is who do we vote for Just blok Piet. We all have tried to reason with him. I have no time for such negativity "@SanFran Arnold - What do you mean by SC? And when you say Jacob Zuma is appearing on Monday FF plus wants a succession from SA @Mzala i see u comrade ANC = carried to the thrown. no struggle no nothing Is @ALTA here today? If you are heeeelllllloooooooo ANC = Dope trade (with Afghans e.a.) 
1:03:00,1:04:07, I have blocked that Piet Vast guy long ago because what he is doing constitute as spamming. @Anti DA - SC is Senior Counsel and JZ is 16 - 20 Nov. It surely cannot be the Monday that has passed ANC can step down now... the only struggle we have is from the ANC ANC = the biggest murder machine on the continent ever I am watching Piet Vast and the live stream....so entertained!!!🤪🤣☠ PIET VAST = ANC @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee I was saying the EFF contested 96 wards and won 0 but still it was not the biggest looser as that title is reserved for the DA. @SanFran Arnold 🤣😂🤣 "@Yolo More my lady Y 
1:04:20,1:05:24, @Mzala i see u ANC = fat bellies and BMW 7 series for the Cadres who took DA wards lol @SanFran Arnold - Is he still moaning about this commission being biased against him? The Patriotic Front did well as they gained a ward and lost nothing. @Anti DA - I am sure that he is "@Carlyle Fortune they must be allowed to succeed PIET VAST = ANC engine DA won how many wards? 
1:05:30,1:07:18, @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee Hahaha some of his own medicine PIET VAST we still vote ANC ANC = Anene Booysen death was 'normal crime' only dumb people vote ANC ANC = NonononononBoers are not being killed in da Rainbow nation ANC is feeding PIET VAST ANC = corruption @SanFran Arnold - Thanks for filling me in. I am waiting for Jacob Zuma's and that crook named Pravin Gordon day. PIET VAST is having sexual relations with ANC members

1:08:31,1:09:26, PIET VAST is in cahoots with ANC is Pravin ANC? ANC = Stabbing the Dalai Lama in da baaaaack "The anc in the western cape is behind the "" makin" The IFP did well as they successfully defended all their wards and took the Nkandla one from the ANC. ANC = no morals on BIG bellies @SanFran Arnold - The problem is the commissioner doesn't have strong command of the English language😴😴 PIET VAST is part of the ANC and the corruption ANC = Death of the Khoi 
1:09:29,1:09:46, @Anti DA - I disagree with you completely Are you guys in this chat doing this political thing because people around you stopped listening? Or because you have nothing intelligent to say as regards the commission? @Yolo More do you see me @ Sibusiso Cilo Pravin is man of integrity. "Who's the Head of Elections in the DA? I like Piet The very same Pravin who pushed so hard for this commission to be a reality? ANC = Corruption Were these wards in Cape town or what? 
1:09:51,1:10:17, if Pravin is a crook .....what and where did he steal.....plse inform us all @melds melds do you see me ANC = plundered SAL on the ground @Zicelo Sokhela They really saw flames Ilan says hello "When DCJ says U r correct Angel. PIET VAST = ANC deciple @ALTA yes I do heya

He kept the Gupta's out of the treasury @Megan Diedericks Things are bad for the DA PIET VAST and his cronies gave the ANC what it is now ANC = police dealing dope @melds melds 😊😊 @SanFran Arnold - It takes Zondo 30 minutes to construct a single sentence in English 😴😴 
1:11:31,1:12:48, ANC = Marikana masacre 'helping the ppppppoooooor' Before started the corruption PIET VAST party was doing the biggest corruption Piet Vast = REALIST ANC = DEBTS DEBTS DEBTS RISING @Tay 🤣 Then the tough questions follow @Mzalwane Mzale DA is racist party they don't want change. PIET VAST never voiced the corruption before the ANC ANC = mama Winnie did not butcher children we only loan 2.1 billion a day as a country. The ANC is great for ZA. 
1:12:51,1:13:44, @Mzalwane Mzala - Was the voting specifically in relation to wards in Cape Town? Its behind making the western cape ungovernable. The will refute those claims but encouraging people frm the eastern cape to come down here to engage in the wrong-doings @Angelo Doubel Those who leave it for the FF plus say it is not pro-white enough. You are right DCJ! PIET VAST never protested or said anything before the ANC became corrupt DCJ yes yes @Anti DA - He does not do that. I don't think you and I are watching the same thing. He has so much law in his head that he runs his comments through everything. @Ismail Petersen you hit the nail on the head So clearly Zondo struggles with English. . 
1:13:52,1:14:33, ANC = BMW for the cadres while the ppl starve on ANIMAL FARM @Mzalwane Mzale 🤣🤣🤣 @Anti DA - you struggle with the law DCJ you are so right sir respect for you ANC = Corruption ANC = GENOCIDE "Piet speaks the truth ANC = theft "if you speak nonsense 
1:14:34,1:15:50, ANC = hypocrisy @Piet Vast ANC may be corrupt but it is not +mama Winnie and did not butcher children as far as I know. rather Mama Winnie was ANC while still alive. PIET VAST never made complaints about apartheid corruption ANC stands for a lot of badness. 🤯🤯🤯 ANC = fake 'liberation' ANC = Slavery ANC = poison PIET VAST is complaining but supported the Apartheid error 
1:16:03,1:16:49, "Anti DA Hello there everyone 😀 ANC = institutional RACISM @William Pieters GM @PIET Vast wants to join the corruption @Malbongwe Bandile 😂😂😂 ANC =BEE @SanFran Arnold - Can you tell the difference between Zondo and the guy that is being cross- questioned in terms of how long it takes between the two to formulate a sentence in English ? ANC = BEE = EXPENSIVE sub standards 
1:16:56,1:17:51, @Lynn Barnard GM hello @ALTA hope you well and happy. PIET VAST= part of the corruption why not sabc 😂😂 I dont think Chair struggles with English @Anti. His command of the language is excellent @Anti DA It is evident that English is not DCJs first language but he is “fluent enough” which many first language speakers are not and understands the law. That is all that is needed. ANC = 25000+ Murders per year Hello daar Alta "@Anti D 
1:17:58,1:19:25, there are comments here of Pravin being a crook. RSA would be properly effed up if it wasn't for Pravin and a few others who stood up to corruption. Anti-PG stories are propaganda. ANC = hospitals turing into shiiiiitholes ANC = Gupta corruption oil @Lynn Barnard goed en jy @Anti DA - again you are lost. DCJ has to be careful about what he says and how he asks questions in order not to jeopardise the commission. You remarks smack of racism ANC = Coldman Sars tyranny @Blake Yogi - All I am saying is they should have employed a better English speaker to head this commission. Zondo is slow in constructing his sentences and this makes me fall asleep 😴 ANC = Starvation in Zim @summer....I fully agree 
1:19:26,1:21:42, ANC = terror in Mozambique @Phakamile Khuzwayo For the first time since its formation the EFF contested more wards than the ANC (96) as the ANC chose not to contest one of the Knysna wards. The return was 0 wards for the EFF. "@Anti D @Piet Vast = Troll "@Piet Vast What position is Mr Sadiek ANC = Sol Plaatjie turning in his grave Piet Vast is part of the corruption "@Anti DA - Being the second highest judge in the land 
1:21:44,1:23:33, Piet Vast was pro apartheid ANC = state capture @mzalwalwane mzala nazoke Dit gaan baie goed Alta. Ek wil jou net vra hoe antwoord ek iemand spesifiek....ek sien mense gebruik @ en dan die naam. Ek is nie te oulik met my foon. Piet Vast = apartheid error ANC = 100 racist laws Ahh director at Denel Piet Vast = apartheid love Piet vast= apartheid crime 
1:23:57,1:24:46, ANC = development is 'lets kill all sparrows' (after killing all with half a brain) "I had to block Anti. Cos of people like that that SABC has another commission stream entitled ""Clean"" cos some are very disrespectful." all gov contract have a cession. the supplier buys the materials and the cession payment is 80% of the value. surprise the financial dept did not know this.the contractor should have sufficient funds Piet Vast = apartheid killings dirty @SanFran Arnold - Have you even listened to those interviews where you have judges butchering the English language because their command of the language is poor? Secession the only answer ANC = lets turn the whole of SA in a Sowetan shiiiithole Thats correct Sadik 
1:25:05,1:25:42, take responsibility for your outragous spend amounting to nothing Did not get the name of the fellow testifying now. @Lynne Barnard druk die@dan die persoon se naam sonder n spasie Piet Vast = Apartheid "If Ace isn't successfully prosecutated leadership challenges NOT financial Chase politicians in your SOE ANC = strong corrupt leadership ANC = oppression

Zondo is not even quicker when he speaks IsiZulu ANC = schools learning nothing "Freedom Front Plus performed well as they lost nothing but took a DA ward in JB Marks @Yolo More do you see me ? "Yoh @Yolo like they are implying this one has become dirty 🤣🤣 
1:26:40,1:27:47, "@Alta Piet Vast = Apartheid racist sanB please ask yolo if she can see me Fluent English is not a sign of intelligence. That is only a perception "Anti D @Lynne Barnard dis n plesier😘 eish man..... ACE hey.... whalalaaaaaa Piet vast = oppressor "@Blake Yogi 
1:27:49,1:28:53, ANC = Big fat Zuma fighting a fire in Nkandla with his floatable yellow duck eff concerns about racism is their big downfall +dreaming about USA. Anti DA account has been created solely to ridicule DCJ and the commission prior to Zuma's appearance. Piet vast= Apathied hate crimes @SanFran Arnold - No I am not anti - Zondo. I just call a spade a spade. It is very clear from the day this commission started that Zondo struggles with English. @Yolo More yes queen👏👏👏👏 @Sibusiso Cilo. If Ace is prosecuted at all. (Anything can still happen from dockets disappearing to witnesses deiappearing or getting intimidated). No way he will not be successfully prosecuted does any1 know if Ace is stepping aside? ANC = corruption at its Zenith

Yes bring on the Burger "ACE "@Thanda I must say I am with you on this. If it happens "Anti D @Phakamile Khuzwayo The EFF was never a ward winning party. It gets council seats through PR list. They have previously won 1 or 2 wards in the North West and nothing else. Lol Zuma is another fool if you are insinuating that I am pro Zuma. 
1:30:04,1:31:44, @Gerard Victor GM Piet Vast = Apartheid lover "@Gerald Victor Piet Vast= Apartheid ANC = police to fat to walk A ANC = SAA on the ground "Guys even if @Piet Vast is a troll @SanFran Arnold - I mean really taking 30 minutes to construct a simple English sentence like how are you is something Zondo suffers from.

So there you go I have learnt 😉 Zondo has absolutely no problem with his command of the English language - in fact it is probably better than 99% of SA population Big daddy: Why is PIET VASt a racist bully....I ONLY SAW TRUTHS....YOU PREFER LIES? 
1:34:11,1:36:41, @Kevin W - Really? You expect a deputy chief justice to speak English like that? "@Anti DA don't mistake his pauses as lack of English vocab. He knows how much words matter in court. Respectfully yours Who is Anti DA? Must have had a different name in the profile I blocked before.🤔 @Lynne Barnard 😊😊😊😊 @person of interest -thank you when does tea break end? @Person of interest - Okay let me just put it this way. Let me not say Zondo command of English is poor since most of his groupies are taking offence of that. Let me rather say he is not articulate. "Anti D He is absolutely articulate 
1:36:48,1:38:16, @A Luta Continua its clear u share alot of his personality hey . I do agree with some of the things but he is a ANC Hater and all he is doing for the last 1 and half hour is rant and rave on the ANC @Nemabubuni Geoffrey - Fine I will just say Zondo can't express himself clearly. from one ranter to another 😂😂 @Yolo More dis alta do you see me skat surely you are not a man anti da I have just blocked Anti DA.

Dont start a conversation if your not prepared to listen or attempt to understand someone else's opinion @Peet Venter - To be honest with you as a black South African I would rather vote for VF plus than the DA because the former doesn't hide it true colours and I like that. DA is a faux party. Thank you @FieliesSA Well said! @ Roza E I wish they would @Valencia J Absolutely darling. Just block them and be rid of the pests The fact of the matter is that all parties in some form of leadership position in this country has failed its citizens an we as citizens need to hold them accountable for that failure. more politics-sigh
