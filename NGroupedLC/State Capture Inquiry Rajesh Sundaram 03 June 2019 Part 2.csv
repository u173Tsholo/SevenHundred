35:42,36:57, yerr is this a hostile take over ? Why are people’s comments in codes now What’s happening🙆🏽‍♀️ Very hostile indeed you tube must act now This is sad Guys it’s not the same without the comments .

45:35,51:07, Someone cast aspersions on the new CEO of the IEC...and it may be correct This testimony about the OEC is a bombshell...watch the fallout soon nothing will happen to these crooks and zuma continues to laugh he he All have smallanyana skeleton says soo bathabile dlamini guys The elections were a farce...what about the boxes found and the bad ink etc...nothing was investigated The rotten 🦈ANC stinks from the head down Anyone who voted for the ANC cannot complain who said we are complaining? "Anc doesn’t send any one to corruption 
51:22,52:23, indeed makhosi Oh so you are not complaining that the country was stolen? do we have to await completion of the hearings /closure of the commission for justice to be seen to be done.? Complain for what exactly\ Not complaining is complicity any party is capable of doing such and even worse. But what is wrong if you want to have a different platform that will show a different version? Is zuma still refuting his special relation with the guptas You should be happy that you were propping up a corrupt party with your vote Zikhona Zindani 
52:40,55:06, "we are far from complain Future generations will be amazed of how some people flocked to the ANC in spite of state capture bunch of dumbasses here eeeeeeeh eeee "They will be no justice served after this ANC till jesus comes back. Being part of the solution and putting pressure on the NPA to do its job is crucial Oh I am very happy about my vote. very pleased with it. The right organisation is leading. now our hurdle is to deal with the aftermath of the zuma maladministration Spice Zondo haha Zokhona Zindani your ignorance is amazing to think anyone will be dealt with 
55:13,56:26, This commissions is an other wasteful and unaccounted expenditure. we must take law into our own hands and deal with dis criminals I also dont think this guy is telling the Trueth? The ANC owe us as citizens apology for what they did and also pay back the money they stole from our fiscas Focus on your party?What party?South Africa belongs to ALL who live it... This is guy knows his telling the truth "But you still vote for your Mafia leaders Doing same thing all over again is a sign of stupidity.ANC leaders are corrupt to the core People in ALEXANDRA are evicted just less than a month after voting for the ANC is the shame for Africans "i believe in traditional courts "Most of the implicated are still in the ANC 
56:31,59:13, "I am supporting all NPA what they will do "@Thando Nkutha How many years will this state capture last What happens if Zondo dies Tommorrow 4 years could be enough I really dont know how many more years this will continue. we kept asking urselves that last week "@makhosi nobhatayi that is exactly what Shamila Batohi said in her presser "Hai State Capture is honestly long dragging these people wll be dead by the time its time to act on them 
59:14,1:00:33, "NPA is useless .do u think if the guptas did this in China they would b in Dubai laughing like that . look at this churches in South Africa .will they operate like this if it was in Kenya  "It’s not just ANC leaders that can’t tell the difference between state & party "Ramaphosa might not even be president by then Evidence still remains @Cassius Mngomezulu zondo must be rush this thing we dont have another 10 years "Zondo's line of interrogation on quotes is trying to intimidate the witness  bushiri and this bo alph lukau pays the same people we elected to rob the poor with their evil ways of manipulating the poors But who will put the pieces together like how zondo is asking questions now 
1:00:42,1:02:17, definitely december 2020 end of story guys remember it was given 2 year only "@Solly 12 Exactly...they act on what they are told.Ace uses the line of party allegiance "We already know the tsotsis hiii whats wrong with remembering exact words like really Is he not supposed to remember why zondo is interrupting this guy or is he defending zuma who would remember the exact words of a conversation that took place 4 years ago Zondo is correct!! 
1:02:30,1:03:50, "I do "Ai mahn Ntate Zondo Zondo is losing it Thats what journalists do hehe zondo is becoming a problem here "I was about to say ANN7 Zuma designed to brainwash and steal even more from the simple anc voters Truth "The person who edited his book should have assisted 
1:03:51,1:05:05, @Thando Nkutha. He said there was no diary. Rajesh getting pireced on use of quotations put an Indian and Zulu together what mixture you get😅 even though we don't like what the judge is saying but is right "This exactly what journalists do "Zondo is correct I am systematically reporting this harassment bots ay zondo is grilling this guy. tjo what is this going to do to his credibility This is such basic knowledge!! me to 
1:05:06,1:05:53, We got the point let's move on Zondo is lecturing the journalist's work iam sure zuma is smilin right now by this Media should be held accountable!! "dankie Mr Judge unprofessional journalist Thanks YouTube for removing the bots and also exposing who it is well he did work for ANN7 MOVE ALONG ALREADY 
1:06:00,1:07:20, "Can he go back to India now zondo is running the showorld now what happened to this lady now "ooh my goodness The truth should be the bottom line- too many lies are occurring Zuma is watching this "This is really important becuase it borders on the credibility of this comrade CREDIBILITY is VERY important!! He should have said “ to the best of my knowledge “ 100% This guys is narrating what happened stop doubting him 
1:07:42,1:08:40, "people can say ""this is not what I said"" and put his entire testiony in jepoardy" Why is judge Zondo grilling this guy for quotations marks?? like really he is mumbling a lot Mumbling lol lol He sounds credible- he was trying to convey the Truth - not cover things up- Zuma is watching this and he's now smiling "@Zinhle Omontle because it's a legal issue "Is Zondo now saying because the quotes are not verbatim He never made notes as a journalists thixo 
1:08:42,1:09:53, "and the Judge is right Thank you let's move hez shaking "This guy may have a recollection of what transpired then. I guess Chair's issue is he cannot quote but to say: "" to the best of my knowledge Throw him out Zondo zuma is being defended here for free This man was only at ANN7 for FOUR months off course he will remember everything What happened? no facts written down tjooo 
1:10:01,1:10:52, uZondo wenzan manje Pipi time for Judge very likely @Tharaxis Nope....legal matters come later....this is a commision of enquiry? @Michael Wild 😆 he is a judge and he needs facts 5 minutes break for the judge aaaaaaaaaawwwwwuuuuu u Zondo Zumas defence is getting thin...you can see how his previous lawyers disappeared...he will have no place to hide only maybe Dubai 
1:10:53,1:12:09, 😃😃😃😃 no wait there are more that is coming email and phone Who is the victim?? "I don’t believe Mr Zondo is implying that he’s lying watching from Brooklyn in Pta "Zondo calling Zuma and he is like Judge wanted to peer one of the reasons I don't buy a news paper @Tee Makara you are correct @magda sequin lawyers will “ disappear “ when they’ve been threatened for defending the truth too remember 
1:12:16,1:14:31, dont trust this judge He is an authentic Judge he should have brought basic principles of journalism and give it to Zondo simple Zondo's attitude towards this guy is similar to that of Adv Pretorius as Agrizzi was concluding his testimony. Behaving like a defence attorney of thieves. If I was this guy I would be discouraged. It’s over for Zumagang. Please help me comprehend who is the victim? If Zondo doesn’t bring Zuma to testify then he can forget bout being Chief Justice Zonda is making sure it will stand in court. must remove the quotations he is throwing the book out of the evidence submission 
1:14:34,1:17:11, Who do the people want to defend?? went to get cup of tea what happened is this tea break? Thando Nkutha obviously u haven’t been paying attention to commission poor guy is risking his life and we still say he's lying wow i wonder 😂😂😂 jett888 do you know what is going on here? Defend the person trying to expose the truth! Help protect him!! "@michael mbatha I remember every persons biography is questionable 
1:17:36,1:19:46, we want our land The guy is knows how Guptas behave behind the Scine and board room Judges are human beings and also has biases it seems Thando Nkutha might help u to use your brain a little bit The Truth is what’s important- those who are brave enough for o expose it should be defended!! they are just clearing the smoke which is a right approach @jett888 100% correct Too much corruption by big elitist and corporations- please protect human rights! We all need to unite to defend the truth! ❤️🌹❤️ In a sense I agree with the Judge but he could have been a bit nicer and not so rough on the guy.He was very lenient to other witnesses like Manuel 
1:19:49,1:22:29, "These people have a backup evidence @jett888 Finish and Klaar Millicent blocked Whether Zondo is biased or not on asking the credibility of the quotes is immaterial. Remember Zuma & company will defend themselves. Their lawyers will definitely ask that question. when will Zuma be on the hot seat Propaganda is on the rise- the UN /NWO Depopulation Agenda is on the rise- please protect those defending our human rights and honesty. ❤️ Zumas lawyers was not up to the task in his last appearance..SC Trengrove was far above their argument Are the boys still at work? Too many people are being intimidated 
1:22:37,1:26:24, Bots* @jett888 true look what they are doing to Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning @khanyi what bots Are there interpreters there? Zuma will say I want testify in Zulu The President is a public figure- photos shouldn’t be hidden- @Magda Seguin you are so correct- we need to defend those exposing corruption!! Always! 🌹❤️🌹 "Zuma will say ""I want to testify with forked tongue""." CJ Moegoeng has stated after consultation that English only must be used in courts...the judge in the Zuma case overruled his Zulu request This affects all of us - whistleblowers and truth tellers need protection- corruption needs to be exposed But this is not a court 
1:27:06,1:29:28, I just saw this on YouTube. what's going on? can anyone explain @Solly 12 the TRUTH doesn’t need a “ court” it only needs to be defended Is this Judge a judge the people voted in? It will go to court...Batohi and Cronje was in fire in their press conference @Caitilin C same here- trying to figure it out- but this person seems to be willing to come forward to expose some sort of corruption Poor guy getting a bit flustered!! "In SA the judiciary is independant He looks like an honest man "Jett888 true 
1:29:43,1:31:14, "Yes we trust him Thank You @MagdaSequin 🙏🏼 wow this is the first time I'm hearing of this. why is this not on the national news it seems very important @barbara broadbent but he’ll be okay- anytime you are telling the truth- it stays consistent. 🌹❤️🌹 What crimes?who must go to jail @Solly 12 Truth or Honesty?

1:31:49,1:32:40, does no one remember this happening lol 🤣🤣🤣 What is the mans name being questioned? @MagdaSequin Twitter Banned me for a Honest Joke I assume he meant 'him' who is our ex president Magda Seguin everyone who participated in this grand corruption called state capture Rajesh Sundaram Rajesh Oh very!! really? for a joke? ZUMA IS CORRUPT 
1:32:47,1:34:32, @jett888 @khalid Mather in the USA- much of mainstream media doesn’t show all - so I have no idea what this is about I agree wholeheartedly @Solly 12 @jett888 watch and learn! @jett888 State Capture Inquiry of South Africa guys you're all seemingly new here @Magda Both in America We use humor sometimes to help ease the Truth from hurting too much It’s like the Steele Dossier- look at how corrupt that was and how much corruption to keep it under wraps- the truth will be revealed! ❤️🌹❤️ We have a very strong constitutional democracy..but the criminals still have ways especially when they have absolute power like our ex president 
1:34:56,1:36:25, if anyone understand please explain I'm confused. this sounds serious but what happened ??? How is it possible that there are people who haven’t been following the proceedings of the commission ✝️⚖️✝️ yooo @barbara broadbent I’m trying!!

1:44:51,1:46:46, "@Magda Seguin Even Trump's lawyer Bathathe Zobdo izinja zegame Justice Zondo wants to make sure this witness can be trusted. He seems to doubt a lot of the information he is giving as published in his book. "dcj @magda Sequin they are ALL propaganda! Only 5 Illuminati families own all the USA mainstream media- this man/ writer is being intimidated for exposing the corruption-I fear for his safety ❤️🌹❤️ @KQ Proud American Woman Are you from the US?

1:57:12,1:58:51, eita Thanks @Shaun Lukhele but the guy is right..why does the dcj and the advocate want to grill him on this? @millicent Shizuoka - anytime someone seems willing to put their life on the line to expose a truth- seems pretty reliable ❤️🌹❤️ @jett888 Hmmm....maybe. He should have been scared after what happened to the guy that filmed a Gupta in Dubai?? If the witness had to write what he felt in his resignation letter he would not have been alive today What is the problem with Zondo today? @makhosi nobhatyi This Musa guys implies corrupt leaders should not be exposed. and...now he blames white population for the fact that the corrupt rot is on the open?

Manyi indeed must be subpoenaed The Chair is between s rock and a hard place- wants the Truth- intimidated - corrupt powers corrupt I wonder why? True @KEITH Agreed jet888. This chair looks confused today

Gupta physically abused a staff member @Magda Seguin American law is so unique. Trump's lawyer have ensured he avoids a subpoena because the law grants him that opportunity. Democrats are between the hard rock and hard surface imagine "maybe he sees an opportunity to market his book in SA it was a terrible working environment been watched all the time while doing your job "I am fully aware about Trump 
2:22:37,2:25:43, It seems like he is not interested about the abuse people suffered under the Guptas. @Keith sindile Dinabantu it corruption through and through- from the UN- NWO Zionist psychopaths running this world- taking down America is the top goal now - Weather & bio warfare has been unleashed Ntate Zondo are you gonna ignore the ABUSE.!! when will the ace magashule book author come to a stand The Guptas flouted BCEA all the time wish they can get the guptas back @jett888 Agreed. its rampant! hang on hang on Zondo is obsessed with the book?
