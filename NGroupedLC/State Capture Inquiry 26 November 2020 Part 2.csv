Not correct nor right. But an ANC murder squad killing them all........Some countries have courts. 
4:00:02,4:02:41, @Louis 😂 😂 😂 @Kopz Koape Exactly so et's talk about it now. "Before Marikana miners massacre Ramaphosa was partially responsible for that incident (DLS) + LMT <> VRL. Kaope if you worked there you'd say different @mzalwalwane mzala even if it is secret Atm iyadakwa ibingeke iphumelele.Atm is another faction used by RET PPL. @Aubrey. from certain sources that police were sent to marakana mines to kill..I dont know about that That kinda Ghostdancing wasn't helpful no. but its no crime is it

Hang on @Heather Durr. He'll park both feet in it... @Aubrey.. Right.. There are so many rumours in relation to marakana. One may never know the truth amco used people 100% media took their side cause people died...which was painful ofcourse but..... :elbowbump: Ramaphosa may lose that motion of no confidence 🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️ 
4:09:05,4:12:51, Well with hindsight but at that time we thought..... @lufuno shumani muloiwa How do you get to that conclusion? Well done DCJ Zondo!! You've got the bottom line argument spot on!! ...THEY PAID HIM TO APPROVE THE CONTRACT. @lufuno shumani that will be the anc funeral @Phakamile Khuzwayo It will not be a secret ballot. @Mzalwane Mzala remember many of the ANC MPs & Deputies will soon be facing criminal charges & evidence is clear. if they keep Ramaphosa it will be suicide for most of them. The worst is yet to come what will happen if cyril goes @Helene..David mabuza will be president 
4:13:02,4:15:31, @lufuno shumani muloiwa It will not be a secret ballot so they can not defy the caucus position. Go Adv Kennedy Go!! @Phakhamile Khuzwayo Remember its now about avoiding jail time by most ANC cadres including Ace. this commission exposed most ANC MPs shenanigans as Bathibile has said @mzalwalwane mzala no I was telling shumani that if ramaphosa removed from the seat that will be the funeral of the anc "we will all be high if Mabuza becomes president Exactly Adv Kennedy!! @Phakamile Khuzwayo I am not disagreeing with you @Mzalwane Mzala maybe that but it will soon be a secret one.. they are buying time. Do you remember Zuma's motions? @Heather Durr Indeed! 
4:15:58,4:18:00, Sigh Yawn @mzalwalwane mzala Amen mzalalwane l would like to make you assure Cyril Ramaphosa is going nowhere. He must clean these mess done by ANC. There citizens want to see those who are guilty in orange jumpsuit 🙈👍🤣 @lufuno shumani muloiwa The courts said the Speaker is the one who decided whether it is a secret or open ballot. The Speaker have decided on an open ballot. Jy lieg! but ramaphosa is also a bee millionaire just lik his brother in law Motsepe ...a king sits back and take credit for managing his kingdom of fools. "@Heather Durr Maybe for you but @Thabo its just a matter of time..most ANC NEC & NWC members are implicated they cnt keep a guy who will soon send them to jail one by one..thats what ACE is fighting for 
4:18:21,4:20:15, luckily the speaker is sober not like that hypocrite elingu Baleka "@Heather Durr And yes @Naledi Barron Yes absolutely I wonder what kind of president mabuza will be if he is elected..Is there anyone clean in the ANC???.. Will he be worse than his predecessor??? @Mzalwane Mzala Yess but remember the ground must be created first to assist the speaker to decide rationally soo. thats why i said they are buying time & this motions is the first of many to follow @Heather Durr Respect!

"@Heather Durr I know sis. Which gives a unique perspective when observing what is going down right now Jabu u are spot on him and Ramaphosa MUST thank the white man whom they now openly ridicule. @lufuno shumani muloiwa There is no such EFF case but a 2017 constitutional court judgement (UDM)and the court said 'Speaker of the National Assembly has the constitutional power to prescribe'. "@Jabu Malinga he fooled me last year when he appeared before the commission wow 
4:30:43,4:34:28, Ramaphosa must get his marching orders. Sadly the capacity to replace him is nowhere to be found in corrupt SA. @lufuno shumani muloiwa United Democratic Movement v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others (CCT89/17) [2017] ZACC 21; 2017 (8) BCLR 1061 (CC); 2017 (5) SA 300 (CC) (22 June 2017) Ramaphosa has poor judgement why retain Ace magashula and bheki cele and aaron moatseledi in his cabinet Mr. Ramaphosa is a lame duck. I think he is lazy. :dothefive:STOP BEE:dothefive: @Val yes "@Rory Lee Farnham :dothefive:BEE IS CRIMINAL:dothefive: ...Ramaphosa must not irritate members for fear of having to answer that he might incriminate himself. 
4:35:38,4:37:13, No powers to remove but isnt he the president????..Who is Ace??? ramaphosa is a bang broek @Lee D. Hendrix do you think he will stoop that low? Shoulda Woulda Coulda ...Not yet @kopz koape ace was elected by branches "The other company known as TUB "War against corruption: AFU freezes R111m from businessman who claimed TERS for 6 "because they know things about him and if he lets them go they will expose him. remeber Bathabile ""everyone in the ANC has skeletonyana"" Ramalockdown is not clean either."

Ok but why cant he remove bheki cele or all the useless and corrupt ministers??? @Heather Durr BOOM! @Phakamile..Do they have something on Ramaphosa??? That Ramaphosa doesnt want anyone to know about? which minister has been found to be corrupt by the court of law? @kopz koape he is scared shame 
4:41:25,4:43:49, @ Fezile Willem Ramaphosa IS a rand billionaire worth about R 6 billion from several sources. How he raised that money?🤷🏿‍♂️ @Heather Durr Not you personally - just the developments as exposed by Adv Kennedy LOL @TW. Bheke cele was found guilty of corruption that's why Zuma was forced to remove him @kopz koape 99% of them are corrupt HE WAS CORRECT BUT NOT RIGHT 😁 @Phakamile..I wonder who are in the 1% who are squeaky clean??? "public servant means what? a minister Which minister is not corrupt? @Heather Durr I've never found any of your comments to be offensive. You're a smart cookie. Let it go!! 
4:43:49,4:45:50, @Kopz are you referring to a PP report that was overturned by a court? No court has found Cele to have been corrupt!! Mr Kennedy is rightly offended by this issue "they job of public servants should be given to retired doctors THESE CROOKS WILL ALL RECEIVE A PARDON 😡 "boom you see "should Ramaphosa be voted out the cabinet ministers and deputy ministers are all out  @Jabu that is the way they work in Switzerland. ...

"@Goaten - I stand behind Pravin Gorhan and Trevor Manuel.

6:41:25,6:43:15, @Louis C What then?:goodvibes::goodvibes: @Naledi Barron - Pravin Gordon has just threatened whistle blowers who exposed the fact that he appointed a Chief staff with only matric qualifications and you want to support such a tsotsi? @Goaten - go play with Koko "ANC business similar to FRELIMO @Thanda Sibisi I respect your P.O.V! @Fezile Willem Ghee is used in indian cooking @Goaten - Facts please. @Naledi Barron - LOL Queen B is colored and they don't do the lobola thing in coloured community😆 @Goaten - Don't care.

6:44:05,6:46:31, @Goaten - you maybe mistaken there "@Goaten - Sweetie @Andre Gerber Zuma should drop it first as he is the mastermind @Naledi Barron - You aren't aware of what Pravin Gordon has just done? Go and look up what I have just told you on the Internet. Type Pravin Gordon breaches whistle blowers ACT and see what comes up @Fezile Willem 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 lock this crook up. haaibo wena! "@Goaten - Alright This guy is sweating or he's got diabetes! He must accept and move on 
6:46:36,6:48:50, That is why people are losing respect they initially had for him. He is just like the rest of ANC corrupt officials. Media has just treated him well because they are captured. @L. M You also going to do the homework Goaten has set for us? Can we go through his bank statement "Saloojee must just cry😭 - maybe they’ll let him go I don't think Mr Salujee will be able to wake up tomorrow to go for his specials in the BLACK FRIDAY🤔 i know that`s a community with dynamics @Naledi Barron @Lerato Moleke 😂😂😂😂😂 "@Naledi Barron - Not sure about Trevor Manuel but I think that insurance company he was a chairperson for old mutual 
6:49:01,6:51:36, "...It sounds like this guy is paid for nothing at all No problem @Naledi Barron... @Goaten - and @L. M I will definitely do my homework! Thank you both! Is there Black Friday specials for arms and defense items? Maybe he's conflicted. To go or not to go! Yeah thanks Old Mutual. Trevor Manuel acted suspicious in that case...very very suspicious. All these media darlings are turning out to be not as the angels they were portrayed to be. i think he was appointed as GCEO because he met the affirmative action policy Can they investigate VR Laser's bank account?. A pattern of non compliance exists in all the procurement processes. @L. M - What do you mean that I am mistaken? 
6:51:57,6:55:05, Is VR Laser still a registered company in S.A? @Ntokozo Dube @Goaten - and @L.M Old Mutual = Nedbank. Maria Ramos = Absa. @Ntokozo Dube they already working on their accounts (Vr Laser) Joh:shelterin:lol the whole day😅😅😅 I also used to respect Pravin Gordon but everything that is coming out about him which most of it is suppressed by the media because they treat him with kid gloves is just proving EFF right. I mean VR Laser has been trashed and smashed against all corruption woes at Denel! a coloured community depends on the specific household to pay lobola or not but not generally @Goaten - stuff though Guys what is the name of this guys being grilled ? 
6:55:22,6:56:55, Well @Goaten - I'm on Twitter. How can I find you? @L.M - Yeah you are right. But mostly those are the coloureds with black heritage... "Mr Saloojee @JM it's Salujee VR Laser was duped into partnership by the Gupta's . Hope this answers all your questions. Thank you Walter. "@Goaten - Careful sweetie! Pick your battles "@Inspekta Dope.... m not sure state capture comission i want to know all people who were found guilty waht will be their panishment n outcome thankx 
6:57:04,6:59:35, "i`m glad that you agree with me hence the term ""coloured"" "@J M @Naledi Barron - You are right. One must apply logic but based on the latest developments you can see that Pravin is guilty as a sin cos his own advisor resigned after challenging him. @Maria s what important points did Deputy president announce during parliaments questioning and answering session? @ Bongile Sango.... glad if they are on it.... VR Laser is a Benoni based Steel company. @Goaten - Want to take this onto the Tweeter forum? @L.M - No you are right. I just completely forgot about the dynamics in the term coloured. Atul and Salim left you to carry the can Mr Saloojee 
6:59:46,7:00:47, I don't wish i was Salujee. Will he sleep tonight ? @Naledi Barron - Yes that will be okay.. @Louis C Indeed they did! Aai angelo basicly nothing. Just they gonna take money from uif to bailout Eskom again and saa will go semi private to save it from liquidation @Goaten - You have a Twitter name?
