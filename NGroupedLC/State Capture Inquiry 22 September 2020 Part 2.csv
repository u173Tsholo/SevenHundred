47:12,48:21, This is the ANC at work- we love our people- and does not use the excuse.... i dont recall Thanks ANC for all this this witness needs protection the time is now to call those who things they are the lords I agree Kgotso Eh eh eh Mr. Mokoena is using this space to hit back to Zwane. sonder ons #ANC sal jy langs jou skoene loop. haai shame. LOL 
48:24,49:49, POLITICS is not dangerous at all if done the right way! It’s the people involved in politics who are dangerous! 😡 advice HOD's refuse to sign the documents send the advisor back to the messenger ANC has no quaams about taking out one of their own "This people are cruel Kgotso no protection needed we need snipers now kill them all one by one sies @Monica uAce ufuna icuticura for lamachubhabha wakhe results of corruption is jail Well ‘some’ of the people involved in politics are dang! Not all of them (correction) @kevindbn007 I hope he has security this will not sit well with thieves at Lootfreely and Cele will be very un-happy.-being fired himself for corruption

53:15,54:22, "eishh he signed @makhosi nobhatyi this is I guy I love to serve he is the real ANC! Politics has always been ruined by greediness and corruption in my opinion Kgotso..Ace and Mosebenzi will duck all this till they die like ubaba. He should've called Zwane's bluff. Obviously Zwane didn't have the balls to fire him I thought he did not sign....he signed even though he knew... but they were going to make his life difficult "@Kgotso Mpete  hes being open.... 
54:24,55:29, how refreshing to have a witness who answers the questions and remembers. tough situation who is the current witness Mr Mokoena didn't want to walk beside his shoes shem They will fire him by colluding with everyone on the department He signed under duress Lost his innocence just when it called for strength @Serepa Le Mabona yes i agree with you. Children come first in this situation. when you think about the starving of children you will not sleep at night. "@Kevindbn very tough 
55:37,56:18, This bastaad is also corrupt. He should have refused to sign😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Mr. Mokoena is answering questions with gusto😂🤣🤷 he looks like Mbkei's younger brother from on angle "this man seems innocent in his face He signed voluntarily he had no choice "NPA is so week How disgusting. @Mbuso Ndlovu this guy ibicinga emva ekhaya 
56:19,57:17, @Akhonamandla Gala his integrity was tested big time 😂😂 Mbuso were you going to help him pay his bills? lol @banda one always has a choice Poor people still have no houses. true Joan "very tru Joan "indeed "NPA  @siphumliso mbidana Where is he cinging now😂😂😂😂😂?????????? 
57:19,58:22, this whole inquiry is smoke screen to fool the people. now the real looting can continue It is easy to say that. Mr Mokoena was forced to sign under duress and if there was legal support within the department I think that would have given options the MEC can take a report on suspension and for employee will be frustrated with huge legal costs to prove innocence "@Mbuso Ndlovu yey ungaphantsi qgithi ngoku "@Kevin Davis who is this MEC ? eish legal..... the fake inquiry 
58:27,59:27, Molekoane yes absolutely 👍 "Sies these politicians Zwane? "😂😂😂he says 'traditionally' meaning in FS corruption was a tradition lol doors "@kevindbn007 I do. This guy will be marked man The power to appoint resides with administration not politicians the fake inquiry No that is not so 
59:32,1:00:33, @Canis Africanis he is sweating chair I'm also confussed . And where did procurement regulations fit into all of this "@ Mike @Bizana Ngesi I agree with you Here comes the Sotho expression😅🤣😂 After this revelation Ace Magashule will ask CR to resigns lol interesting People are dead refusing to agree to illegal processes under this corrupt government 
1:00:41,1:01:35, 😂😂😂 MEC comes with the list of contractors who supposed to get tenders which province...I guess FS O tla tsamaya thoko ha dieta tsa hao unbelievably sad Zwane was a Tsar of FS defended by Ace. the processes they have outlined should be legally challanged "why looked shocked mhmmm interesting "lists 
1:01:45,1:02:58, devastating testimony @Makhosi Nobhatyi..utheni ngoAce Magashule? Otlaba moputsoa. im sure no tender processes Oh LOrd ANC I am beginning to doubt this guy ANC is now a very honest party thanks to the INQUIRY """Otla tsamaya ka thoko ho dieta"" - African Proverb" I can imagine two gentlemen with identical voices threating each other😅🤣😂 
1:03:02,1:05:12, "@Thabo Mokoaleli  this mlungu is calling constructors contractors @KC simply meaning?

"please believe this guy he is smilnig... he is so friendly smiling @Thabo Ditseho he was a chairperson and regional executive committee member at Thabo Mofutsanyana (Local municipality in the FS) This guy is so relaxed @FieliesSA more like a smiling assassin Free State was the Capital City of State Capture project and yet Ace Mag hasn't appeared 
1:12:16,1:13:30, "@KC  why is this bloak smiling? Is this a joke to him ? Ace will be the next president Oh no Tyrone. Why do you accept to be appointed HOD on paper and in practice Zwane is telling you what to do?Where is your integrity? @Tyrone Askew I think so too. if not ACE ZUMA will be the next president eh chair lomfo yacuma phambi kwakho🙄 does CR have COVID?

ZUMA can't fall. otherwise no more ANC @Tyrone Askew is positioning himself to be the next president and he is on track. Very manipulative and conniving. Too many chiefs. "Zwane and Ace are not for black and poor people nyani nje @thembisa "NPA and the Hawks are not useless. The information is useful in building cases. Without information @Y vD we have to deal with the same issues in private sector as well...no integrity watch the space 
1:15:44,1:17:44, KC I wanted to know if he was a pastor or a school teacher "This is exactly what's happened in PPE scandal/corruption This guy did wrong in co operating and signing! I however feel sorry in some way for him as it must be tough and cold for him outside the ANC. You're right @Pontsho Mosiea @Serepa Le Mabona in the 80's he was just a mere member of the ANC and around the 90's became a secretary of the region (Frankfort) and then around the 2000 he started going up the ranks. @Cerebis I agree... You guys are disturbing🤣🤣🤣 @Thabo Ditseho i have no idea It explains the desperation of the Premier league as to why they wanted NDZ hoping everything will be swept under the carpet 
1:18:04,1:19:45, 😂😂 Tyrone Askew a failed state does not carry out such processes. there comes Vrede 😂😂😂 "@Thabo Ditseho Free state is corrupt to the core "this hearing is a symptom of a failed state is ACE ever suspect any Person for corruption. if He who?
