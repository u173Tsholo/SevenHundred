9:22,18:09, why is the hawks not arresting this people "@Lucky123 Thwala Thing is "@Lucky123 Thwala I am sorry iyho 😷😷 @hilton modike Hawks are still trying to entangle themselves from state capture. They were deep in the state capture ditch as well. what is this issue about vincent smith. Please fill me in @keith sindile dinabantu i have a feeling that zuma was right when he said he will expose most of the politicians who stole so much .its will take 10 years 4 the Anc 2 clean itself "Are there any high profile cases that Hawks persued "Just one question  
19:28,33:41, @mfumo Maluleke nwana mhani there was a corrupt tender given to bosasa at the airport and they were paying vincent smith R670000.00 & they did his security upgrade @his home 4 free .at a cost of k200 "They should also ask Cyril Ramaphosa what he knew about state capture the guptas were real mafias the story that they employed fikile mbalula to b a sports miniter came up again on weekend .i guess made it a point that they put dirts on all the ministers The position was vacant for 6 years cause the Guptas were still looking for a stooge. "What happened was the always accessible cyril ramaphosa have got a women to work with i c a courageous women like thuli madonsela in her .this women was bullied so much & never succumbed @amanda watson i guess there was a way that she could be accessible with all this pressure on her .because i guess she feared that she have to explain things in a way they wanted her to the manner in which she was treated by faith muthambi as a women is embarassing . i cant believe that some women help men to perpetuate patriarchy against womens OH OH 
34:47,40:42, Thando lots of posts vacant but unemployment is high?? Eish! Talking of efficiency? 👀 UMM with all this evidence why dont we have these officials being on the dock. We were made to believe that the inquiry wont stop prosecutions but nothing is forthcoming. SOMETHING BIG SHE IS COOKING ayikho iphunga yehlathi isizulu sisho njalo kuthen abantu abamnama besenza nje A 6 year vacancy on a country with so much unemployment.😒 "to.all the womens in this country  I don't say they must be sent to jail but this evidence should be running parallel with evidence before a judge. Remember this evidence is evidence before court yet. 
41:26,47:17, "I said it on Friday and I'm going to say it again No Thando you dont seem to understand. I like Me Williams Gupta leaks were enough prima facie evidence and readonable prospects of prosecution. successful prosecution did anyone implicated deny authenticity of allegations so detailed the only denial was that Saxonwold could have been a shebeen Is she still there at GCIS ? 
47:29,53:16, "the lawyer is so cute. if she was questioning me No Thando Hawks is the investigating unit not the commission @J Ganasan I'm sure you would.....lol so you were sidelined from your position os DDG - maybe were incompetent @j ganasan .i guess it was fair to let her remain on her position if she was not comperent.the fact that she was acting for this long it tells that she is competent. @j ganasan i thought u could c between the lines that she was treated unfairly. if she was incompetent - then the minister and DG did the right thing @j ganasan .i think u would have felt much bitter if it wad u .because what was happening to her was unfair .and she was bullied by ur brothers atul's puppets It seems like she is angry 😀😀😀 
53:58,57:15, philane u can say that again .i would have felt the same they were bullied "She loves her power and positions shame. it seems to me that had they given her the nice promotions Is angry crying typical useless public servant - now claiming stress. eix so sad "very sad tortured - no one touched your body. seems like u had nice meals. too much food in fact 
57:35,59:56, j ganasan u r a typical gupta puppets .why dont u ask the guptas to return home Lawyers for the defense will use her anger to ridicule her testimony. hilton - stop making false accusations. Gupta and Zuma shd be behind bars. But this obese lady should get real 😂😂 "when you principled if ur mom was obesse were u going to say it .who u are to charge how she looks .that tells how stupid u saw her "Yeah that tells that u are stupid .since she refused to b a puppet for ur master """this woman""" 
1:00:01,1:02:24, "I respect Chairperson of the Commission Yessss this commission is starting to heat up now. Some comments from the likes of J Ganasan are just pure immoral The State capture did not only damage the Government's monies but it actually emotionally abused our Mothers. It breaks my heart seeing Ms Williams holding back her tears. Herman he is highly professional is his job. Funny how many people here are now assuming that she was a victim just because she says so. "Yes "This is what I observe Booi they tried their best all of them it wasn't easy 
1:02:31,1:08:50, @hilton modike Spot on! Zuma was correct! That shows there is a lot of corrupt to be revealed ahead of us. This calls for a lifestyle audit for all these corrupt fat cats this chocking stories we here people will be surprised when the hear another version of how this Willams lady tormented here staff. she is setting the record straight. believe me this is unaccepted at all "I don't buy that Madluphuthu why should we just take her word for it? these allegations still need to be tested. @Philani ngcobo it just shows you how easily people are persuaded. Just shed a few tears and you'll have them eating out of the palm of your hand. Will Faith Muthambi come before the commission? 
1:09:21,1:16:45, Yes she has to thx cool @Amukelani Mdluli M- It seems u know something? mutambi people are these j z supporters don't cease to amaze me . they will support you even if you kill . they will try to find something to defend the indefeasible Mutambi was serving her boss those supporting Williams must all be fat lazy public servants too I seems straight. it 
1:17:55,1:22:39, tourched? Can we all block this Ganasan dude - He's got energy in discriminating other folks just because of their skin colour and how they look. It just can be..mxm J Ganasan this is how Gupta get in government to loot government resources It turns out that some people here have already pre determined the outcome here. Maybe the commission should just conclude its business cause its seems that we now know what happened. im blocking u Marvel and Makhosi. Ure rude haibo I've blocked them already funny how people are so aggressive towards people who do not agree with them. ey you guys are funny yaz. what a courageous human being. 
1:22:48,1:26:13, Amandla Miss Williams. Fearless in the face of adversity Protection for Ma Williams please Thando - ure loss. No skin off my back baby "There’s zuma faction in this comment section childish Ms Williams is no fun to look at “Bought Champagne”😂😂😂😂 Madluphutu... you are so disappointing with ur defence brigade role which is not goig to earn you anything...there's enough evidence to corroborate Pumla William's testimony... rofl 
1:26:14,1:29:40, you are right miss /mrs William. muthambi is the enemy of the people of South Africa as a whole not only South Africa the continent as a whole. You are right @Thando Bring it on mama Williams very proud of you mama Well done Phumla Williams. Expose the scumbags. "Let's fight against corruption/irregularities wherever we are. We owe it to our country! Yes Wow wow Miss William’s on point. "Its clear that she is exposing corruption what did we expect... the ministers who were in replace we obvious in work with the guptas 
1:29:43,1:33:30, she has taken an oath..and her testimony will form part of a report and thise accused will have to take in on review Madluputu...this is so so sad bra...get off ur horse... corruption has to be uprooted absolutely "Chetty she is well educated and has experience we need from a person "I'm guessing most people here are not familiar with the principle of ""Audi Alteram partem rule"". they just listen to a witness and make a conclusion. Unfortunately Faith not faithful? we can't be so dumb to praise those who steal our hard earned taxes "Well done South Africa Why are they even fighting a crime is a crime 
1:33:34,1:35:54, our taxes are been stolen hle banna☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹☹🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 sure David. @madluphutu elaborate for us Whats sad is the apparent lack of respect that our government officials have for citizens/taxpayers intelligence. Thinking that we cant see through what they are doing. thanks to those sons and daughters of our beautiful country for their bravery and courage "..and I'm not praising anybody here Thank you Julius Malema for fighting corruption corruption is evil "@David Masupa the problem with corruption is that 
1:36:09,1:38:03, "@Hardus Schoeman true dat The truth will come out eventually its just sad that it must take so long for us to get back on track as a country 😞 Malema is not a saint here... he was part of the corruption nobody has denied that the guptas received a refund from says . that is just one of many. "This dude is out of order ssrs "Corruption is every where "She really knows her story dis 'n katnes! 
1:38:11,1:41:25, According to a recent report the CIA warned the South African government about the Guptas's illicit activities as early as 2009! so it must just go on This woman has that struggle attitude "And take into account that Williams is being lead. None of her allegations are being challenged. Surely if she was talking about u i remember jimmy manyi telling us e - toll is not a dream it's reality we have to live with it. I would like to tell him that commision of inquiry is not a dream it's real he will have to explain. Mr Manyi send a text sms to Ms Williams to tell her what and what not to say... ha ha ha He will be called in to oead his evidence as well she is ready to be cross examined. are they ready? volume please 
1:41:27,1:46:33, Interview for a position that Ms Williams never applied for ??????? Is procedures followed on her current position ? "Uncle cyril must also come in and give account "Its so annoying when people pre-judge the process. You might think you are being smart by so doing including Gwede Lol Fernando serious Zuma was president not Cyril "the guptas said they only want white waitresses because blacks are not clean enough for their liking "@David I was so furious  
1:47:40,2:02:49, "HE COULD HAVE BEEN OUT BY NOW Absolutely @Dalu this women mara is amazing...she knws her story R u ppl on lunch? faith muthambi banna. yerrr That voice is too deep. "Honourable Muthambi where is she from and what qualifications she possess Faith Muthambi??? Stay safe Mama Williams.
