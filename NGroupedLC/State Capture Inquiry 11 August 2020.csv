4:48,7:59, Happy woman’s week and woman’s month to all South African woman. I hope there won't be any postponement today and the rest of the week phela time is money. Morning everyone we now know guptas circle of lawyers 🤔😂😂😂 Who is writing these letters? I think it should be one person same format coz now secretary is pushing back just have to take leave from the depressing yesterday afternoon about the passing o Bop Mabena "Morning all Beds made May he rest in Perfect Peace we need a copy on that paper coz of any imegency people not to think much including addition:yt::yt::yt::yt::yt::yt: Always coming with Victim hood excuses... same strategy all crooks are applying... 
12:41,16:16, "Money TK  "Dear Judge Zondo. Please "@ Dave too true aingeke deputy chief justice your voice box😂😂 what noise is that it is irritating. "plse the rules must apply accordingly hi bho same Nkandla strategy 😂😂😂 
16:31,16:59, hip I agree that these may be delaying tactics but the commission is clumsy and opens itself up to credibility issues. HMMMMM Did someone just fart HMMMMMMM HMMMMMM HMMMMMM HMMMMMMMM HMMMMMMMM 
17:01,18:06, hip HMMMMMMM THATS ALL HE KNOWS Simple the truth will set you free. hahaha he is making justice zondo laugh gupta boy wasting time hmmmmmmm hmmmmm hmmmmmmm 
18:10,21:19, hahahahaha Mmmmmmm Mmmmmmm Mmmmm and get paid month end. morning all we are back here again. Who is evidence leader? u people and your biasis u end up sounding dumb. why is the chairperson refusing to do the basics of conducting the process? Mr Roy Van Rooyen Let's apply a rule from a childhood game called Monopoly. Go directly to jail. Do not pass begin. Do not collect R200. Tear up the get out of jail free card. what is this I thought those who want to cross-examine have to give their own version first. Or did I get that wrong? 
21:27,22:52, These lawyers are wasting time ngoku the chairperson must play by the rules. why is he changing the rules when Fuzile must be exposed of his lies 🤥 what is happening here @Nyameko Gqadu also want to know lamola there are rules of the commission and we must play by the rules why trying to defend van rooyen for giving his side of the story... The DCJ needs to answer the question of precedence as raised...he should be thinking about his report being challenged later on and therefore must ensure as best as he can that he adheres to them. hmmmmmmmm....mmmmm correct Mnguni the DCJ is losing his impartiality 
23:04,25:57, "@Nyameko Gqadu  so e want to cross examine before we give evidence? Nah Surely the Judge could have recommended long time ago for Zuma and the Guptas to be prosecuted to recover the taxpayer's monies that can assist the poorest of the poor. Dave notes he should also have recommended for de klerk and your land thieves ancestors to be jailed too "Hi @all - just cam in De Klerk wangamubala yena LOOPHOLES Des van Rooyen THIS GUY KNOWS HIS STORY 
26:14,27:30, Breathe u are about to have a heart attck Unfortunately there is a pattern of disrespecting the DCJ developing here... and rude too HE HAS DONE HIS STORY @Cain very true - he's giving credence to some like me who are suspicious of his inclinations. bathathe Masuku THAT LADY JUDGE OPEN A CAN OF WORMS NOW ZONDO IS A CLOWN try something else Masuku... Nkandla strategy of victimhood won't work this time around 😂😂😂😂 
27:38,29:00, Indeed now he's shuffling Ashley he brought that onto himself after the ridiculous situation with Makhubele v o2xp "hau Masuku Masuku has got this wrong. 8.1 and 8.2 are clear. It’s not about normal court processes. This is a commission of inquiry. What he allowed there was unavceptable I am no fan of the Guptaz and their friends but I think Advocate Masuku has a point. I don't understand why Justice Zondo has a problem with Van Rooyen Cross-examining Fuzile first. u now want to fetter the discretion of the DCJ waste of time. time is money 
29:02,30:39, "Masuku is a clown... Derik Hanekom 1 - zuma 0 But the commission communicated a process...it must explain the deviation. bathathe Mr Masuku No deviatiin Zondo can do what he thinks suit the situation correct the DCJ is losing the plot uyindoda Masuku bathukile manje THIS COMMISSION IS THE PITS "This is not a trial masuku is an embarrassment to black excellence 
30:46,31:46, Exactly MGati F Remember..... The Strategy of NKANDLA team is to the render the Commission disfunctional van rooyen must give his side of the story first Zondo Commission is nothing else but an institute design to targert those who have been identified as the enemies of Neo-Colonialism and their white associates. A black SC is called an embarrassment...... Tebogo u r the embarrassment BRING BACK APARTHEID Masuku doesn’t make sense coz his client is going to give evidence whether he start giving evidence or cross examination 
31:50,33:49, Ag Zulu get a life. You do not even knpw what it means so u came here with a clear intention Makhosi be quiet 🤫 u embarrassing yourself THIS IS A JOKE someone must report masuku to the bar. ANOTHER PROSPONEMENT this whole state capture is just a set up Another delay if he will tell the truth what difference does it make - do they want to coax him with answers so tyhat he can lie more convuiincingly 
34:00,34:45, The commissions legal team is an embarrassment beyond imagination. amazing how the law helps criminals Mr Masuku's tactics of delaying at its' best. If the commisiion does not do their work @Cain chuda I don’t see his inclination for his submission No postponement at all They open themselves to thos It takes time to fabricate evidence... problem is they are not through! 
34:49,35:46, Kind of crap too much heresay Adv Masuku one of the best SC in the country is making solid legal points You should have made sure all paperwork is correct!! wats the cost of this commission so far? THIS MASUKU IS DROPPING BOMBS Dominic Przybylski I agree - anything to get more rtime to yindoda uMasuku uyayazi intoyakhe correctly so Masuku is excellent. he's won the day 
35:59,37:27, What's happening here? MASUKU TRASSHED ZONDO indeed MASUKU TRASHED ZONDO ZONDO IS ACLOWN Zondo has been badly found wanting. uyindoda Masuku 👌 UYINDODa masuku 1.9k 💃 
37:30,42:14, masuku is the man "If cases lost..Wasting state money that could go towards all our poor communities masuku thank u zondo loopholes Masuku the King kube niyabona ukuthi imali idliwa kanjani The RET brigade is on fire here. Stalingrad tactics becomes a norm by SC representing Gupta stooges i.e. Adv Maluleka last week The evidence leader is bumbling along and the chair is not interjecting... 
42:47,46:54, 2k💃 DCJ most probably will use his discretion and reject Masuku' application. yes Monde the DCJ is really embarrassing and I don't know what happened to him masango u an embarrassment I'm sure u wouldn't even know what the Socalled stalingrad is everyone in sa is an embarrasment for letting this slide Van Rooyen's evidence is important because his evidence could directly implicate Zuma and Guptas. SA is a joke now keep looting guys 
48:01,50:38, Cain hope you are an example of excellence "Money talks the report will be released on 2024 This evidence leader is incoherent...at one stage the rules are important and a breath later not so much but the most disappointment is from the DCJ himself. Why can't these people get their act together and get basic things like documents sorted out. van rooyen interacting with mkhwebane... report written by mkhwebane in 2018🤔🤔🤔 I agree Monde Indeed Monde u correct Mnguni @Melvict you would think they will make sure of such. 
53:58,56:48, procedural fairness is very important making money Surely he had a copy of that document.... "the legal team is making the work of zondo difficult if i may ask; did Mr van rooyen testify before? "bavikela ama client abo kumthetho ofuna ukubagojela "@Zamile Hina  "Thanks "Mr van Rooyen should only come forward and state the truth 
57:02,58:35, "@Cain Chunda  where r the con artists that were attacking n insulting Masuku here? "Manuka is right @Zamile Hina not according to my knowledge "An hour in and you have tea time ..start at 10 time wasting Zondo is allowing himself to be manipulated. @funiciaz the DCJ was asked to implement the rules "to me Zondo had dropped the ball. I know he's trying to be fair but honestly he seems to have very little control 
58:38,59:47, In the Beninging can they adjust the focus but why he can be allowed to question MR Vuzile first en testify later? Another 1.5 hours gone 🤔 This is just another stalling tactic. Tell him to go and sit down!! THIRTY MINUTES TEA WHAT A DISGRACE play games No wonder the courts never get their job done. I AM BUSY WITH DOING PUZZLES ON THE PC 
59:50,1:18:12, You are setting a very bad precedent Mr Chair.... that will disturb your smooth running of this commission 🤔🤔🤔 No Paul only started at 10:00 Surely before any questioning begins Van Rooyen should introduce himself and give some background to who he is and what his qualifications are? "He a had a copy of the documents last year already Weird that his testimony begins with a cross-examination of somebody else. "Grant Pannewitz; there are extended charges ...not announced + "Morning Everyone "..In this Place tea time 
1:20:06,1:34:46, @Stronger together ; what was the tool used to by the Catholic Church take God's authority from Him? @Makhosini Floyd zwane Inquiry resumes at 11H30 "Just joined Wow! Only 3 minutes late! lol he looks scared shame what is this going to help "...@Melanie Maritz compilation of SIU Heya @Pastor J and the gang! Sorry I'm late! "We usually start this way..spent the whole 15 minutes on files 
1:35:55,1:36:59, so they gonna waste more time now Mr Zondo wasting time What was that?! what was that ? hebana 😂😂😂 This guy must calm down. Hebana Hebanna!!!! 
1:37:00,1:37:24, SABC doing SABC things.... 🚮 SABC dont want us see the cross examination @T.K....Just wat happed haibo 😂😂😂 😂😂😂Haibo 😂😂Shania twain is still a thing in SA? henana!! sign of a drama thats about to unfold 🤣 Hhahahahahahahahahahahha

1:39:37,1:42:45, time wasting Zondo 1billion and counting l. where is shanaia twain now Waste of time !!!!! They were given 30min to sort everything out...what’s the delay... DCJ :dothefive::dothefive::dothefive: Zondo mannnn "Perhaps the Chair ought to recommend that PowerPoint be used so pages can be displayed easier and quicker. The filing system can be confusing to one who has not compiled them zondo must lecture then before the state capture is televising:elbowbump::elbowbump::elbowbump: this is what my fear as first day as an advocate looks like 
1:43:02,1:47:06, One hour only DCJ please allows the question to follow. Who is dumber here the attorney or Fuzile? mr weekend special van rooyen this man is using siliva while opening pages then touching his nose nose rubbing brown nosing? What has this got to do with anything? This Evindence of Fuzile Is very Important To Zondo wow 
1:48:05,1:51:06, We are all over the document todays I heard about ppl impersonating advocates and taking on whole trials n cases in Ghana until they were caught This guys is disorganized. Was it not possible for Masuku to do the cross-examination? "We are moving South African Democracy is very expensive indeed. Volùme Mhlekasi! can we move to a question part uh ehh uh eh eh uhh this is bad 
1:51:07,1:53:23, what s this guy trying to do? Seconded question time please """...before you proceed...""? It is council's role to proceed Such a Brilliant Lawyer Des has a master's degree Already the Gupta family were in the negative light in South Africa. Shows that a degree is no protection against corruption or a lack of ethics. master's degree in Public Development and Management from the Wits on what capacity did Godongwana call the finance directo? who he was to him. 
1:53:43,1:56:35, most qualified minister of finance to date !!! This is a very difficult life for Blacks with degree in South Africa:ONLY CONNECTION NOT QUALIFICATIONS MATTERS. Quaklification and common sense don't necessarily live in the same body having a masters degree from a south african uni does not mean anything So he arrived with so called Advisors. Highly educated person cannot claim ignorance when he becomes part of a corrupt situation. advisor = handler i know that but he was actually qualified for the job the 1st in modern democracy "Melvit Melbourne 
1:56:52,1:58:13, "it is not a wish Des van Rooyen was the best qualified ever... If he wasn't forced to follow the script of the Guptas it may have worked/ Success is the ultimate qualification. @Laban Vilakazi - experience counts and he did not have any THEY NOT LOST A BABY CANT RESIST A LOLI This lawyer though.....the the the the.....can't he read properly? mind you his other advisor/handler was JZ? What Is The name of this adv 
1:58:29,1:59:56, very inexperienced Not following the questioning by the Advocate. "Does he know what a ""spine"" is?" the red file "No i beg to differ this Advocate is weak Guy's..we are not even enjoying the cross examination.. What's all the reading about if there will not be questions? he doesn't knw the spine When Trevor Manuel was appointed he never had neither qualifications nor trail of success in Finance... 
2:00:16,2:01:34, The hour is gong to expire without anything happening ? Try and migrate then you'll see Dont worry Cyril doesnt know what a spine is either.... searching for 2mins UCT is top in top 40. Lets hope that Des doesn't waste as much time as his attorney does Mr Fuzile has made it clear that he can't wait for cross examine by Mr Van weekend special Royen udlize u van rooyen lomeli agreed @Elneamo 
2:01:48,2:04:06, Give him time to adjust I don't understand where the Adv. is going with this questioning Adv must seat down please and soon it will be lunch time and NOTHING will have happened. The tax payers money pouring down the drain while these people discuss what's on the spine of the file. this advocate is trying t find a corner on d circle he is restless this van royen adv this is painful to watch Silent Scream:chillwdog: These people are making noise. 
2:04:12,2:05:24, Fuzile comes out a bit over confident and arrogant. seriously!??? "I'm in Qatar as we speak This advocate is not prepared. They assumed Chair was going to postpone. This Adv is out of other guys Us viewers have absolutely zèrò context to go by! How long is going to take? This Adv is out of order guys @Lucky Dlamini will act that way as well if I'm being cross examine by a crook Can't these guys get something as basic as numbering files properly 
2:05:24,2:07:04, spineless "UCT is in South Africa Melvit Surely only 2 -3 files per witnesses pee pee "I don't need to undermine it are u happy with our adv guyz what a shambles page numbering has been a thorn at the Commission. I know UCT is in SA. It is also no 39 in the world 
2:07:48,2:10:12, the chair is gonna adjourn nw because or numbering kkkkkkk lol "Stronger together comfort break chair Lucky Dlamini i m a bit confused by ur assertion that mr lungisa is over confidence nd the likes wht dd u expect from him whn van royen is duck n diving 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I just tuned in what chaos is this ? But our post grad qualifications are recognised globally QS world wid eputbit at 220 "this committee must be closed 
2:10:14,2:12:29, QS Global World Ranking ranked UCT at 220 in the world "Daysman UCT IS THE EPICENTRE OF UNIVERSITIES GUYZ this advocate is useless...Mrs Matanda was just trying being polite kuyaliwa apha noted Mr Dlamini probably i misunderstood u lol van rooyen is a criminal "Now you are talking about somethimg else 
2:12:41,2:13:52, fuze lamafuze fuzile is angry at this slow dude Wow "Mthathe CHAIR IS PROTECTING FUZILE :washhands: Arrogance Does that one has a Masters degree to begin with probably we reading information from a high school dropout fuze lamafuze mudle

2:16:49,2:17:37, I am struggling to follow the story of today... Am I the only 1????? Kushubile (the tension is thick) KuLit hehe corner somewhere Why did Des Van Rooyen even bother asking for a right to cross-examine? Mr Fuzile is mopping the floor with his Counsel! "Kuwarm kuBurrrd :yougotthis::yougotthis::yougotthis::yougotthis::yougotthis::yougotthis: kuyaliwa apha wr call it cross examination 😂inomsindo ngoku indodomXhosa 
2:17:48,2:18:18, awa Mr lawyer 🤭 this is a trainwreck it will end in tears what was the question...hehehe lol yes he does not like it lol correct Ongama👍 wasting time i c english interpretation

Zilwele Fuzile💪💪💪💪 
2:18:48,2:19:54, Why is Zondo talking on his behalf???? Fuzile is standing his ground The attorney is unclear of cross examination KUNZIMA Mr Fuzile is far tooo sharp for this attorney. He is waffling now Fuzile should just excuse himself from this mediocre lawyer who clearly is here to provoke him and made him loose his cool thats a tactic used by liers and looters "Fuzile has lost his cool Mr Fuzile was an excellent witness last year INDEED 
2:19:55,2:20:31, I was hoping that you will support your statement with facts He doesn't even know a SPINE Probably a Gupta Advocate "😂Vusumzi they All He lost the fact Des lost here:goodvibes: time out This one is straight out a Gupta Advovo Problem is he prepared this examination following a different book - unprepared even 
2:20:31,2:21:11, "Mr Fuzile is credible and articulate Is this what his senior council fought for??? What a waste of time meant hey all what's been happening? Zondo coming to Fuzile's rescue he was close to tears ur left with 5 minutes Mr. Mathipa team gupta is under pressure here score 1- 0 The attorney is all over... I'm unable to follow his main objective in questioning. Can't even put a question into the witness This Advocate is not seeking the truth but wants only entrapment. Fuzile needs to calm down. I know it can be very annoying when you are being questioned by someone whose IQ is lower than yours. I sense that Fuzile is becoming a bit arrogant. 
2:21:12,2:21:42, "@Daysman "@Esme Van Heerden  When would this commission end? Keith odwa is a troll! Seems this lawyer is trying to twist interpretation of witness statements. Some of these lawyers are a joke stru... I am not going to suggest but I am suggesting that.... focus on important issues 👏👏👏👏 The Advocate is an example of 'Black excellence' or Radical Economic Transformation 
2:21:46,2:22:49, 😂😂😂😂 @thando yes he is a troll. he was at our chats aswell "is this ""delay tactics"" ??" HEEBANA Yes DCJ the nation wants the facts not sentiment Only has 3 minutes left now fuzile is also on the comments is this guy mathipa a lawyer? I can do better 🤣🤣🤣 "circles 
2:22:53,2:23:57, We are all confused MR Fuzile you are not alone. The lawyer is not making it easy. Keith you suffer from ignorance This lawyer is going to look bad because he has no leg to stand on! "watch The purpose of Cross Examination is to create doubt. Van Rooyen's lawyer is failing to punch holes in Lungisa's testimony. Van Rooyen's Digging himself deeper in a hole. No such thing people like Fuzile agents of reactionary forces Calm down old man:washhands: "Keith listens selectively @Margaret i m lost now i knw this lawyer guy who is cross examining Fuzile is doing so on van rooyen's behalf right i m not too sure about the clarity on ur side

I agree you do much better I think Fuzile is going to make mistakes coz he is loosing his cool This guy.. Des Van Rooyen’s legal team spent so much time arguing for the cross examination of Fuzile prior to Van Rooyen’s testimony and this is what they come with Absolutely @Estelle Kruger "viva Mr Fuzile viva  
2:24:44,2:25:22, Fuzile must remain calm in all aspects becuase the lawyer is doing this on purpose Van rooyen is a liar Fuzile is lying Silly questions indeed Fuzile is a liar the Chair may might as well do the cross examination as this Advocate is clearly useless hostile witness only if he is your own witness I'd also be annoyed by a stupid lawyer who's wasting Fuzile's time Fuzile 💪💪💪💪 
2:25:26,2:26:19, Why is he emotional when he is telling the truth? he is getting exposed "@Estelle Keith is just one of many south africans who choose to live in obscurity "lost billions when Van Rooyen was put as finance minister This lack of press statement from Weekend Special causes the Rand to crash and SA lost billions in forex I will never be misled by enemy agents spine is the back... spine is the back of the file...
