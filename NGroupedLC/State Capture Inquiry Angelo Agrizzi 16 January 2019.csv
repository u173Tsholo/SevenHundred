Not a day goes past without us hearing of yet another corruption scandal involving the ANC yeah there is no ANC without voters and voters are majority All those voters are hoping for their time at the trough. Otherwise why would they support clearly corrupt office bearers? Let's move on from politics and have some fun with this. Somebody has to enlighten the ANC voters ANC Sheepel voters have been complaining about allegations of corruption in the ANC which doesn't make them corrupt. some even left the party due to their unhappiness.
