time,34:46,message watching it please teach him how to pronounce 'determine' You sure you can not teach him yourself hahaha. Clearly failure to pronounce that word does not change the overall point they set to articulate. I am still straggling to understand why some South Africans particularly those lenient to a particular individual not want the state capture continue and these mess known to the Public Hoping after all the state capture is finished we will see people on the wrong side of the law will go to jail Hallo @Khaya Nkonki are related to Nkonki Inc? Just asking for a friend. üòÄ So according to news reports ...there will be no arrests for state capture. It is the law... Agrissi and five others are out on bail. They were arrested. 
36:47,58:50, "@Jean-Pierre Le Rocks in the head likes to talk shyte. The full statement ends with ""until at least the end of the year""." ‚ÄúIt would not be prudent to act on information and evidence now until the Commission makes a determination on the matter ...‚Äù unless on cases where a witness admits to having committed an offense in line with tje terms of reference and the evidence is concrete. .. üëç At least she accept that she did deserve to be in jail @Luvuyo Zantsi "@luvuyo They should all go to jail...te whole board!! The problem in exonerating Dudu is that she has been involved in many shady activities and she seemed to have political influences 
1:02:21,1:13:16, this witness is protecting the other bribed beancounters. true lol@beancounters "examples "Obvious coverup Vuyo you think someone is at least informing the judge on a c. "Dont be so surprised that the audit firms were corrupted "Do not think judge is advised on a/c issues Sars should do an lifestyle audit on Dudu and that will put her in jail sooner than later. 
1:14:17,1:40:07, true I am layman. But appears to me that is going to be laid bare later. The guys leading are quite methodical. """11 alarming charts that show the South African economy is in deep We are going into governance(law and order) shedding. This is just fiddling while the country is on fire. "but Vuyi Zondo was born confused My father used to attend the same skool with Zondo. Zondo was not the fastest learnerüòÄüòÅüòÇ @Luvuyo Zantsi Mbuso is just trolling to get a reaction. Do not discredit Zondo. No need. He is just chairing and directing the commission. Any one could chair that. Zondo asks for the general population to follow. He is cool. Respect. 
1:41:17,1:45:44, This is what is needed in Zimbabwe now. All found to be corrupt must be jailed @lordmore Karanda Sorry we can't run Zimbabwe for you Not called for @ Mbuso Ndlovu ‚Äã Zondo is a judge now. Your father? @Phillip Cwazibe üëè "Hi all Ndaa ndaa Le t me get back to work. This is what i get paid for 
1:46:35,1:54:36, please tell me what is this guy saying A very long tea break?? @Maryann Diamond This guy is trying to be famouse here. They must let him go he is boring We need action 86%üò≥ thievery "With such a high number of irregular items "Please note what is going on here. If 80% of a sample selection is deemed non compliant Anc is in charge Bet they all got big Bonus as usual üí∞ 
1:55:07,1:59:14, "DCJ of cause they should have expanded the sample size and carried out substantive checks Agreed This seems criminal. This person who is an auditor has an obligation to report criminal behaviour to the police. There is a practice in this country to give the real thieves a pass on criminality. Can the judge seek clarity from witnesses not guide them on what they can say to justify shoddy work. @Marcus Mmola .......i say the same etc Non compliance simple is their langauge to indicate serious irregularities which clearly in other words is stealing was rampant. @Marcus spot on! "Problem with AG 
1:59:19,2:15:18, "All key words ie Workshops The DCJ Zondo.....does this very often etc... "Also IRBA is just a dog without teeth to bite Police and NPA and govt depts in general steal public money because they can and worse still how there cover each other and we as the public are powerless. Honour among thieves and f# the people. The PIC commission was combative but this one is too accommodating for toxic info. Bring Mrs Hofmeyer back. She and Zondo has much better chemistry. OOEEFFF! Bombshell!! Miss Hofmeyer is a darling to listen to listen to. Havnt' admired anyone more. hollywood should recruit her. Loved to see her compassion when handling Mr X application for in camera hearing I realy think DCJ Zondo is great........but often he is just toooo accommodating....... 
2:15:32,2:22:06, "No DCJ is sharp. Look he is proving his mettle! "@EDWARD ZVAVAREYI Yes MAYBE....giving all of them rope.....to hang themselves etc...... ü§£ü§£ü§£ "I also think Judge Zondo is the best candidate. He is slow DCJ is really clear "The ""mess"" is thieving and you did not report to the police? Then what can one say about you and your duty as an auditor." Not really he is not giving these guys any rope. He is just helping so as to give a clearer picture! 
2:23:12,2:28:30, "...Polani Sokombela IS SPEAKING ABOUT THE ROOTS OF EVIL. THE WORLDWIDE PUBLIC SUFFERS FROM THE CORPORATE EDUCATION SYSTEM's VENUES I just hope and pray that he will not be captured/influenced etc later on by the ANC.....in SA...Anything is possible.........but I hope not.. AG has come to testify on what they found. When I see jail time......I will then believe etc......until then.......not too convinced amen I don't trust The System...at all. me too there is no law and order in this country yeah Mike don't hold your breath. Commissions in this country has been a TV Soap . No real accountability. Isidemeni is proof of that. 
2:29:14,2:37:42, @Maryann Diamond .....too true.......very sad indeed... I want to believe.......but I just can't.... I think many South African will feel the same way.....dunno ...The US Dept. of Commerce mirrors Price Waterhouse and eat SA its true we are still waiting hopelessly for VBS circus to be resolved if any. If we could only get rid of the Commies/Socialists....what a great country this will be... Its sad how the government is opposed to react on these for a better future. Yet they are so involved and implicated it makes sense they want to stay silent. And this as we put them in power stop on "Well 
2:38:04,2:46:13, true this are the very funds looted to be used to sponsor political careers for some politicians and their organisations.We are in trouble. Tjo Is he saying 2 hundred and 8 or thousand? "Judge Zondo is such a fair and bright man along with his legal team. I am proud of the work they are doing at this commission. I hope people will see the inside of jail cells "@Ricus Ellis The majority did nothing wrong by voting ANC. is better than those who disenfranchised and discriminated against the majority. ANC liberated us from apartheid 208 There is 8 Million plus unemployed people in the country who will again vote for the ANC since it is the only Party who historically speak to their plight @Moshoeu Mabusela ....So you will vote for them even though you Top Bra's are all corrupted etcetc...... 
2:47:38,2:53:42, Cause if the DA did that......i would totally not vote for them.......now that is the way to think Bra..... "...If one notices "corruption has nothing to do with being an ANC official @ Lee...........better than Communism / Socialism.....ne @Chef Brown ....but the ANC are supporting them......true ...Cyril is President of the Corporation of SA South Africa really has money. Or at least had. People just allocated it in a corrupt and careless way "As John Steenhuisen said in the response to SONA ...ANC Corporation 
2:53:58,2:58:20, @FieliesSA ......spot on Bra @pheladi SA is bankrupt. They don' t have money There is literally corrupt people in the stop structures of the ANC. And nothing is being done. Stealing food out of peoples mouths. Yet people still vote ANC. "dudu just broke for lunch she hungry Seriously trouble is brewing in the corridors of power! "@mike Durban @Chef Brown .....absolutely...100% "But @Christiaan du Plessis "pwc
