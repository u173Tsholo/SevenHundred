I strongly believe we would be faced with international sanctions if EFF took over. Shut up DCJ-Why are you answering for this witness-Have you been 'cartured Bonjour @elton van neel ca va bien? 
35:19,36:54, Heya @Heather Durr aiy il stream via ENCA the sound qaulity ain't getting better EFF will mess up our currency as well @Ntuthuko Nene Does Mashaba take corruption seriously? @Elton Van neel Eff is the one who took Zuma down after his refusal to step down. EFF made this commission @Thukoko Nene - your are 100% correct. 😂😂😂😂😂😂ijo @Kukri Fire im also planning my departure from ANC "Haai kajeni it's not Zuma who gave Zondo job 
37:03,37:35, @Michael Markovitz thanks i hope so too. Also tell them they must up their standards. Some months ago the camera man was eating chappies he had to be stopped by Zondo. no Ramaphosa made this commission possible and soon we will see Julius in the Hot Seat 🔥 I agree Ruan "He hasn't switched up yet "I think you all saw what happened at Nigeria  @Tumi lol tell them true Tumi. truth prevail at the end 
37:39,39:41, @tumi 100% correct @Matthew lol freedom front does what for the black people??? @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee - the only thing the EFF has done is to bring Zuma down. So why have they stopped marching against corruption of Ace Magashule etc? "Mzala they have a full list of their core values on the ActionSA website. Mashaba has a proven record as the mayor of Jozi. He is for the people  Thank you @Val Speirs if anything happens to Malema there are plenty more fighters on the ground to continue the work for EFF @Ndlovu ure playing games Zondo always had a job "🤣🤣🤣🤣@Val Spier @Val Speirs yes I will vote FF+ in the next lifetime 😊 
39:43,40:54, Freedom Front + will never take this country forward just like BLF and the likes "EFF must never rule with those values @Canis are you sure? because it's long that the ANC is self correcting itself. @Nene EFF is the only party doing the work? what arw the others doing? they picked the cameraman and the sound technician by the streetcl I vote for transparent governance not based on race. @Val Speirs You just had to drag Julius Malema's name into this 🙄 "@Madolidoli Mahumapelo 
40:58,41:40, Julius the fool The Dagga Party ❎ transparency and accountability @Raun lol EFF is the future It's time people be put in thier place EFF stopped the sleeping in parliment @Ntuthuko Nene Mashaba says in his party there will be no leadership elections as he will choose the leaders except the president and provincial chairs. Is that democratic? So it's a political party bashing day today here on the chats. nothing to do with comission🙄🙄🙄 Estoy bien. También tú en Nueva Zelanda @Naledi "The ANC is completely unable to self correct. They protected Zuma for years saying he's done no wrong

"If you want things to be said The FF+ will rule South Africa @Val Speirs @Simphiwe Kubheka ​: They are.

45:35,46:10, @Mervin Fire!!!! "if you want things to be more corrupt vote for EFf  honestly I am not looking at a certain party to lead us from evil and deliver us to a healthy state but to reliable leadership "Steve hofmeyer the reason your discusing EFF it mean something . i just wanna see orange overalls ok cool .....I've only been in England for a day then went to cork Ireland for a month LOL @elton van neel I KNOW!! 😀 I miss my country so much!! instead of red 😕

49:03,49:32, @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee 😄hidden junk. we need to vote for candidates not parties cause they all the same and no one will account for wrong doings cause it's a collective There was a reason Julius and Hacob fallout because Jacob did not make Julius a beneficiary of his corruption When Zuma is coming to the commission? hey @Naledi Barron lol it should be some tropical island just the waves foreign language and the sun @ Naledi @elton van neel DCJ did some questionable things on Friday. I am watching him very closely "Without Juju sound is panned left and out of sync .. 
49:32,50:22, The EFF is the third biggest party in this country. I remember Zuma when he questioned the terminology of STATE CAPTURE. I guess he was not aware that the commission was actually gonna look at all the entities of the state being looted by the corrupt. DA run areas are doing much better than the ANC's i play fortnite😂 "daddy dee Heya @Teunis van Ree ! What about the townships @TheC4RB1N3 ? teunis GM @Yolo more ya there this too much info we never hear but Juju keep it real. EFF is the future

"Sure @Mzala they don't care about the township wena ovela kwi-jhb @Valencia j Only people with a matric certificate shoul be allowed to vote Are you saying the goodness of the DA ends in the suburbs @TheC4RB1N3 and you are justifying that? They don’t care about anyone not just there people we are the people they only for themselves to 
52:45,53:35, @Simphiwe doesn't DA still run Pretoria Zuma never understood what a Commission into State Capture really entailed because Prosecuters and some members of NPA had been captured by him. @Heather Durr what did DCJ do on Friday? That's not fair Gerard 3 suiker asb @ Alta People I actually don't have a problem about who is going to lead South Afrca as long as corruption is curb and they put people fisrt in their government administration @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee When they say Cape Town is well run they ignore Khayelitsha. "I think DJC goes to bed every night with a headache @Marvin Harrison i think we should be weary of assuming that @eff or @ourda or @myanc saved us... it was South Africans who saved SA... 
53:41,54:41, @Gerard wants attention ag shem @Ntuthuko Nene: Why when the ANC dropped a pass rate to 30% "@Mzalw ANC is causing unemployment @Gerard Victor - Correct!. the uneducated masses get bluffed with party T-shirts. @Mzala ure wasting your time on that one. He is biased comprised and seems like a racist @Sipho Mahlangu agreed mate The EFF ia actually the ANC Youtleague !! Cancer!!! I am not going to blame the ANC for what is happening in a province and a municipality that is run by the DA. @Mzalwane what about the townships in ANC areas 
54:42,56:03, @ Sherwin Peters: Does the truth hurt? @Mzala u know them mos I guess Gerard we as citizens could have signed a petition to have that pass rate decision reversed. if brains were elastic the eff wont have enough to make.a garter for a canary ANC TOO MUCH CHEESE BOYS Same Modus operandi used on Eskom executives 🙈🙈 fat cats @ Ntuthuko Nene : As citizens we mean nothig-look at how the ruling party treats their own and steals from them-disgusting @Nic relax this is EFF ure talking about the only party doing the work 
56:06,57:18, EFF WE SEE DONT NEED BRAINS LOL Are you agreeing that there is no difference in townships that are run by the ANC and those that are under the DA and you still insist that the DA is better? ANC GOT GREEDY...THEY NEVER SAW SO MUCH MONEY Newly crowned Miss SA 2020🔥🔥 "Yes @ Nic "@Gerard the truth is black people are more politically astute than you give them credit for blaming da for bringing services in townships is unfair hw can you help these ppl who are building shacks every day? IS THERE ANY MONEY TRAIL FROM PREVIUOS APARTHEID GOV?????? DA don't do nothing they even bought a black guy to help them get votes they are desperate and now lost without Musi 
57:44,59:34, The DA Should be dumped as a Political party because they support Apartheid Israel. This lady stood up against corrupt Mantsha Sound missing a channel? @elton van neel very true. @Phakamile Khuzwayo Your party must not be in government it does not want to deal with governance challenges. @Mervin TOO MUCH FIRE!!! "@mervin harrison Spot on! The NP was just as corrupt as the ANC is. Only difference is that the NP buried the evidence deep @Anwar .Not just the DA ...all of the politicians @mervin Harrison people went around the world stealing whole country’s and they want to come talk nonsense here 
59:37,1:00:58, @Anwar Syed You are right and @elton van neel is not being truthful as there are parties that are sensitive to the Palestinian plight. @mzalwalwane my party is anc the most corrupt and my next vote will be between action sa or da @BiG Zee it will just happen with the next government and the next and the next and the next This corruption is far worse than any previous government or any country. It is a blatant illegal entitlement to black empowerment. GREED They should be ashamed of themselves @Yolo More He interrupted Myburgs x examination to tell the witness that the witness who gave the affidavit was also untruthful. You NEVER do that-u may still get an admission by the witness under x is this Tau related to Supra? Self empowerment by corruption. :chillwdog: 
1:01:05,1:02:30, @Phakamile Khuzwayo loosing your vote will not make much difference to the ANC @Mzala all governments have too many secrets hidden from the people .as the people we ive the right to know what's happening in our country "I support Steenhuisen and Mashaba Country thieves ONE GOAL THE LAND STEENHUISEN is great. Are you arguing against having a government @elton van neel ? "ANC is still the favourite of all other parties @Mzala wars have been concocted Due to the fact of power Greed and money 
1:02:31,1:03:18, 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 "@Herb Tuck Yes Lynne Brown and her handlers must be dealt with decisively. Their underhand dealings caused much harm for competent executives. What happened at Denel also happened at Eskom and Transnet "I agree this corruption is unprecedented. No economy can prosper and grow with this kind of corruption. How can anyone be blind to this? SABC @TheC4RB1N3 Then why did Herman leave OP? "Currently the DA is the only opposition "@mzalwalwane loosing my clan votes would be too much for anc @mzalwane yes indeed you never hear about DA corruption and the better DA schooling & hospitals is causing a massive influx of people from ECape It’s impossible for DA to keep up I'm arguing Greed Secrets from the people power hunger governments 
1:03:19,1:04:18, +DP DA is like a camper they don't build they just want to sit and wait for a chance like a thief in the night.

Its why i left SA in 94 when reverse apartheid kicked in To think we used to build the Rooivalk. A respected attack helicopter around the world. Wonder if we can still do it with all this corruption. Your ancestors fought tribal wars. Tribal land very much exists today. The government owns so much land so there is no need to steal it from the farmers that feed this nation. has anyone brought a shred of tangible evidence against zuma yet ? two years later nothing nothing just gossip maevalwe lento ":yt:#Elton  "I like Myburgh SC but at times he is too ambitious and emotional "Yes
