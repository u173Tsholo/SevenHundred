UCT is full of new coming doctors "Yeah true. I learnt that even by watching.

24:42,26:16, "@bekithemba masa Yes we are oh masa....zuma is top dog.. @Thobani Mkananda Adv. Pretorius has been around but was working behind the scenes deploying other evidence leaders. he is the leader to all evidence leaders. "masa Zuma last appeared last year. and he has CAncelled every time I think 3 times now. it wrong for anyone to rude to the commission Low cost housing equals high opportunity for fraud Because Zuma is the one we wanna hear. He is the one who must answer many unanswered questions and been implicated by many witnesses. He needs answers. Pravin will have his turn @bekithemba masa . Is Gordhan the accused or is his evidence being cross examined? both Thanks my brother @Kgotso Mpete 🙏🏾 
26:18,29:11, "@Mfundo yes "Yes he has been patient. "@Kgotso Mpete "appearance is the issue  "the double standards just to get at Zuma are amazing  "@Mfundo absolutely Its prioritizing. oh masa...u got mentality of eff 
29:12,30:32, Just to clarify that Showerhead will have to confirm that he will appear from 16-20 October 2020. If he doesn't then Zondo will proceed with a summons on 9th October "Nobody said Pravin wont come again "Kgotso Mpete "if Zondo is practising such double standards @Blake Yogi Indeed... we're literally going around in circles if we don't interrogate the head of the issue... "The noose is tightening. The Guptas a troll in the house named Masa eff troll a mosquito even 
30:37,32:26, Ayanda Ngubane please unblock me on WhatsApp "@bekithemba masa Nah... he's pro-Zuma @cassim so I don't think he's EFF... "I expected that from Zondo  @Mfundo Maybe now they are not doing so because investigations are making them not to sleep at night😂😂😂 but using eff mentality "Only Zumas fans and lovers will think its unfair that he doesnt come. Justice yeah... that mentality worries me for the future of SA "I m pro fairness 
33:08,35:18, "We need closure in all this State Capture or Corruption that took place.Heads must roll "@Kgotso Mpete only eff gunning for pravin..rest of south africa acknowledges pravins attempts to fight the looters "Well it'll be fair if Zuma appears so he can answer questions @Freddy Pummer Was he not originally scheduled to appear this week? Instead of appearing he urgently sent a letter through his attorneys putting forward lofty reasons? "all gossip will not be admitted as evidence in any court  "@a b c I can already see we are talking against a wall. You are so right zuma not going to come...going to tell zondo he is going to be sick...lol ya ace magashule must talk there is a smoking gun...you will end like Muammar Gaddafi all of you... 
35:36,37:07, 😂🤣😂🤣 it was Carl's idea 💡 "@Blake Yogi... I've just realized also... a shame "Media has been singing about ARMS DEAL  whr are those two gupta's Guys? "@Mfundo yes @Freddy Pummer Hence the summons on that date for a fixed dates in November unless the chair receives compelling reasons for not being able to honour those dates. . . "@a b c "as long as #Zondo cant explain why he neva issued summons to Pravin  compelling reasons...aaaww..im old and sick 
37:35,40:06, Do we have a witness today? "@Blake Yogi exactly... it's one of the reason that some of these crimunals go free in the first place @Cassim Suleman I feel you 🤣🤣 "@ cassim sandf going to give sick leave again I wish this very same scrutiny is applied to tender corruption of Covid R500bn funds which is being swept after the carpet "yes The NPA can now use this information to prosecute in the future "The law turns slowly some times 
40:12,41:34, @ Andy . Exactly that’s why jz has a bee in his bonnet now "Prestorius talks about bidding process  "corruption this  @blake yogi...sick means ..u anable unable Reopen the Gates of Robben Island to all these thieves. dont insult robben island.. "the law turns only to those that are targets  "overdose of forensic reports? Where are the outcomes? Hundreds of millions spent on reporting corruption 
42:06,44:16, Sup Canis... @bekithemba masa how do you know Zuma has nothing to do with corruption Listen bekithemba very careful and the contractor disaperared i did not get paid because i was not on the contract eventualy i was put on as contractor and to complete the contract without any part on my side signing any thing the NPA wont be getting drips and draps. Only once things are concluded will 1 full report be given with prosecution recommendations of ALL those Zondo decides based on the evidence. pls understand the justice and police depts are captured..they get paid by looters to lose files ..ignore..etc "the first person who must go to jail is Ramaphosa "what if we start another sort of amnesty thing and then what happens after this amnesty if all decide to tell truth? Who get's prosecuted at the end of the day? 
44:26,45:55, shamilla batohi said that she doesnt know which prosecutor to trust...as a lot of them are corrupt...if cases not coming to court..heres your explanayion @Ricardo Chumani . Sounds like a plan "the SOE corruption happened under Ramaphosas nose  @Herb . Great question. We will only know once he has given answers and findings are unearthed Listening to Advocate Pretorius....this is a BIG MESS "Brilliant idea Ricardo @Blake The NPA are already sifting through the evidence in the Zondo commission as per the charges in the Bosasa case Richardo...Only if they pay back the money and do community service. 1000 hours for every year they should have been sentenced to. tbe reason why they wont be any prosecution is becoz investigations are done according to who media wants to lynch not becoz of corruption as a whole . 
46:06,48:44, Oh it's the old man again... I hope he had a red bull or two this time... Bekithemba masa stop blowing hot air Beki is a zumanite "This guy looks like he doesn't remember anything. Could be wrong Pay back time..Every cent taken must be paid back oh Zondo mntanabantu shame don't compromise your health ngobubunyundululu bababantu your children need you @herb...masa is eff..u cant get rid of him.. All the candidates received that R500k so does it make it right 
48:46,49:58, "yes chair ndz received from cigarette mafia boys @skeet you are right. I blocked. We dont have time for those who want to deflect attention from the heart of corruption "And it was not given to CR to use for himself Bekithemba whose son is in Dubai with the Guptas on that note of postponements did that Judge from Limpopo complete her testimony? "Give us the evidence that others recieved it too  Blake...:dothefive: oops..isnt malema living in cigertte mafis house 
50:08,53:14, the curry chronicles @bekithemba masa REMEMBER EFF VERSUS VBS BANK another disgrace eff troll...on a different planet logic cr17 Thumaminions never see thru their wrongs but will sift thru the exact wrong they are doing and make issue coz others did it . yah Neh @Xolile Titus 🤣🤣 That judge got the DCJ so angry that one 🤣😂 I can't seem to recall @Herb Tuck They are now in India claiming they lost everything and are just simple spice traders now according to a July news report I cannot remember the exact one. "@Blake Yogi thanks for that advice "when Philips came out to spill the beans about VBS look at how the story died down  Indeed 
53:40,55:54, @sam Monkoe the Americans are on to them "u cant accuse JZ of being corrupt then u fail to put that evidence to that regard  Off to that cheese sandwich again ey Zondo... Yep the Americans have given consent to investigate and freeze all Gupta accounts throughout the world tea break so soon?wow They are now on the Money Laundering List from Rauters "@Bev "JZ is still trying to avoid court at all costs "which court is JZ trying to avoid by the way  
55:57,59:24, "Yes... I feel like if they question JZ properly we'll make a huge step forward @ Bev freeze all the accounts as well as the kick backs to JZ and son-take away his apartment in Dubai. Send him back to where he belongs-the grey bar hotel. that is why chair gave the final say about that. He cant run anymore. @bekithemba trump is going to sort them out "@a b c very correct. Even lies "why ? Zuma  @Blake Yogi Indeed! "u convince any one thru evidence not gossip  "Btw guys if you ever get upset over people's opinions 
1:01:00,1:04:05, "pple need to be factual when debating matters  @abc Nice man my jazz of choice is Budaza Bo Mapefane "Zondo wants Zuma to answer Eskom issues yet it was Ramaphosa who was running the SOEs  Hi guy ejoy tbis a London court has given the IDC permission to investigate the Gupta financial transactions in 17 International Banks i mean guys for the sake of our country i think amnesty can help so that we start our country afresh and we can save a lot of money that we spend in these commissions "@Sam Monkoe Really? I should definitely search it out "there is nothing special about USA or london issuing anything over the Guptas coz they are part of the driving force behind statecapture @bekithemba masa do not forget Bank of Baroda that just evaporated as sson as things became hot. 
1:04:50,1:09:18, Do you have evidence of the Americans having a part in the state capture? @Masa Brian. It's an American court. the West poles its nose into SA business but hear how they squeal over interference in their own affairs . that's very lovely indeed "it's not news that the West was deeply involved in SA politics @Sam I read that article this morning. Shocking. Im so glad that it is not up to SA alone to bring Guptas to justice Bank of Baroda records are available with FIC or SARB by the way @Blake Yogi I know man the moves made were so advanced I could not understand them until read that thing twice. "pple want to ignore facts where it doesnt suit their agenda  What's happening with picture guys 
1:09:30,1:12:01, "Only way to stop state capture corruption is ohhh tea break I am still wrapping my head around it. This needs international resources and work to bring them to book. Imagine how many more will be implicated abroad "if Gupta did any corruption in SOEs how did Ramaphosa not pick that up  curry break @bekithemba masa think of government as a company the CEO is responsible for all of his subordinates actions and it is a must that responsible leaders take blame of the ship they were in control of. "I have to admit Ricardo we don't need that the IDC was given the keys to financial records of the gupta from 17 banks they keep our money soon will know all the info "that's better Francis  
1:12:04,1:16:15, If Ramaphosa was in charge of SOE's WHY did Zuma get involved masa okay alright @keith francis I agree with that he was involved in all SOEs. Who on earth could stop him? mankoe does that apply to Ramaphosa too or it's only meant for Zuma @Tumelo great question arms scandal companies already prosecuted overseas years ago. Those countries prepared to give over info but our NPA is very laid back or lack of political will to tackle comrades "Andre that's what we want Ramaphosa to tell us  "Keith do u know why NPA is dragging its feet on that info  
1:16:49,1:21:47, "Ag Cyril was I don't agree masa. then Zuma should not have gotten involved. Evidence leads to then Pres not V Pres "the problem in SA is that certain corruption scandals must be attributed to Zuma alone yet the involvement of many others is deliberately ignored  @Andre. You are wasting your precious energy. That is a superfan you wont get anything right there "We need change in constitution with 80% recall clause so if MP's "I know Yogi 😱 he wants to be careful 😂😂😂😂 Did this guy just say not everything that looks like fraud is fraud😶 
1:21:56,1:24:36, Keith...I like the way you think. not everything looks like a fraud is a fraud!!! heee banna "I would gladly be happy to see every standard required of Zuma being applied fairly to everyone  @Andre Gerber definitely by me. We are not here to defend any implicated peeps. They have legal reps for that Do you understand the word IMPLICATED masa Oh It was irregular. Not fraud. Ok nice Simantics Smallanyana skeletons 😂😂😂 "Zuma must take the blame as he was Pres  @Cain he must come explain to us then cos Im totally gobsmacked by those words 
1:24:38,1:26:22, "all of us have that ""Smallanyana Skeletons""😂😂😂" "@Andre "Andre there are a lot of pple implicated in the state capture but pple cant chose who to pick on coz they dont like "@Kgotso I dont blame Zuma. 🥰 some of these african politican men is Hella fine ipl @Blake Yogi yes indeed 😂😂😂 I need to move to South Africa and find a politican homosexual or down low man😍 
1:26:47,1:28:38, Perv alert @Matteos Rafael Negus Istafanos 😂😂😂yes When is your Secretary General (ANC) coming to appear before the Commission "Corruption in this country has always existed think of small abantwana running around and not knowing if they will eat tonight.State Capture Corruption stole from them. They tell us UBUNTU and IT TAKES A VILLAGE TOM RAISE A CHILD.Then they steal Just blocked him I've never been so close to blocking someone before Chairman look like something Naija spit out "This commission is causing taxpayers excessively now 
1:28:54,1:30:55, @Canis definitely. This isnt a room for that. He must sms 31314 for that "Statecapture has always existed in SA  @Carmen James You've done yourself a favor. He's one individual that is a liability to this community's intellectual bank 🤣😂 "George  Blocked the weird guy. "umgqibile @Thobani Mkananda . Eish....That is not what we are here for. I blocked too. Insulting chair doesnt make anyone greater or wiser @Carmen definitely not 
1:31:14,1:32:31, "Ya living a pathological lie as South african ya will never be free until u rename and decolonize Universities "@Masa maybe other presidents were clever enough to cover their tracks unlike Zuma who became too arrogant Who is this weird guy referred to? "@ Ayanda "pple hate the truth  YES CHAIR HE UNDERSTANDS THE QUESTION "@Carmen James He needs to be starved of attention by people who choose not to block Who is this guy? "just tell the truth 
1:32:46,1:35:37, We have manners and class in habesha community @Thobani Mkananda . Please starve him of attention. Unfortunately I have a very low tolerance threshold. LOL! nbn nonnnnn. n .m but be .. in . Pretorius studied them docs inside out. He is coming for you. These investigators are🔥🔥 "no Ayanda "@ Carmen @Blake Yogi . Hehehe..... ACE MUST GO "it's this selective behaviour that's problematic 
1:36:00,1:36:57, Pretorius is definitely on point with this one... 🤨 these Black South africans try to avoid telling the truth to White Massa 🙄 They need to be recolonized "Theres a reason why Pretorius is Head evidence leader. If you wanna lie to him "He's got a full understanding of the situation so it seems "@Blake Yogi Advocate Pretorius is the grinder "lo like any village we can call a meeting and ask Zuma or Mbeki or anyone to ask them what happened and where is the money. Then NDIYAKUBETHA. USE THE SJAMBOK. @Blake Yogi 100% 
1:37:06,1:38:20, The rest that Mr. Pretorius took did him very well. "thank you Canis  Well done @Thobani Mkananda 😕 @Andre Gerber lol that's true... Someone got to this witness...he's being evasive or acting dof "@Kgotos you are right. he will end up crying and confessing. Like a priest 😂😂😂 @Cerebis . Pretorius was not resting.....He was doing his research. 
1:38:20,1:40:56, @bhekithemba but if you want to kill the snake you hit the head I like his proper British accent The witness is very uncomfortable.... @Mdue he's a creep... pay him no heed... "Zuma agenda makes this inquiry a circus "maybe we should 🤫 I am no colonized african Abysinia "Ayanda CR17 is not an internal ANC matter when CR donors are found in gvt tenders  
1:41:07,1:42:32, @Ayanda Kunene is correct "@Carmen James It would help this witness to make up his mind to keep with the truth I agree @Thobani Mkananda "@Thobani The HOD looks very tired 🦧🦧🦧🦧🦧👨🏼‍⚖️ Please explain to us what has happened to change your mind! Mr colonizer check them 👌🏽 @Thabo his stacks of lies are too heavy thats why he is tired. 
1:42:49,1:44:36, 🤣🤣🤣 Ayanda as a taxpayer I m paying for tenders that CR17 donors are getting as we speak. their donations are far from a Pvt affair when their noses appear in gvt spheres 😊 "NPA is waiting outside Lies causing loss of hearing! Ya wanna be White men That is why u tamed R 700 MILLION ZONDO COMMISSION. THIS IS WHAT IT HAS COST UP TO JULY 2020. NOTHING BUT A LEGAL $JAMBOK HITTING AT EMPTY AIR WHILE THE IINYOKHA GET AWAY. WHERE IS THE CAPITAL OF SOUTH AFRICA. DUBAI? "He's prolonging the inevitable 
1:44:46,1:46:20, There is no such thing as a STANDARD contract was it not Ace Magashule tenure....hahaha no where to hide ..what do they do with so much money??? Speak up! whats up with this meek and mildnesss "NPA CARS. LIKE AUSTIN MARTIN "The commission has failed to provide facts on how JZ is implicated except gossip  His own counsel argued that the scheme was fraudulent!!!! He's tired from coming up with excuses and lies last night @Blake Yogi "Stutter shame poor man why why why the lies untu omdala 
1:47:03,1:48:32, The old man is being pushed into a corner... @thembisa odendaal . That shocks me the most. All these old people lying to the Commission. @a b c he put himself in that corner "There is one thing I wont deny  "But Masa we shouldn't be selective in doing so because this has been the culture within ANC why is my statement retracted .... your sins will find out out!!! no jobs for young people only for old and tired to be used as pony @ a b c. Pretorius is also an old man so let the old man put the old man in the corner. its only fair 😅 
1:48:48,1:50:12, 😂😂😂 Amen @ Blake "Listening to the inquiry no answer You do know!! ...wait 4 it... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 The 'department' ....since when is a department a human? This witness is soo soo intelligent. But now he is acting like he didnt even pass grade 1 
1:50:19,1:51:44, No answer Bekithemba as you are just spuing rubbish. "You won't lie to Pretorius so easily "As a Pres Zuma couldnt be every where or watch each individual who remembers how Ndezu said he couldnt mastermind a fraud plan cos he has zero education🙈 Do you know him @Blake Yogi ? He is so evasive. Seems scared. EXILE ANC CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR BILLIONS GIVEN TO THEM BY GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE DONORS. STEALING STARTED THEN ALREADY.EXPOSE ALL THE SKELETONS.THS GUY WILL STILL GET LUNCH TODAY WHILE ABANTWANA STARVE The evidence leaders have all the evidence at their fingertips @a b c he is back with fire. I think he knows this case even better than himself Their purpose is to give the witnesses the opportunity to contradict the evidence 
1:51:51,1:53:20, "if Ramaphosa cant be held responsible for R500bn covid corruption why must Zuma be held responsible for Eskom  lol yogi @Blake Yogi LOL I think so too... If they can't then charges are liable to be drawn up @Carmen what I meant is he is so highly educated. He understands exactly what is being said but his lies got him bound he is acting as if he only passed grade 2 Simple process "Zuma was the go to man during his tenure  @Andy Pett True... 😱😱😱 
1:53:43,1:55:52, "Andy they must provide it Thanks @Blake Yogi . Got it. He is so hesitant.....Reminds me of Nomvula's P.A.

Pretorius is only warming up. @Carmen that PA who pretended she was trying to be helpful who couldnt remember her birthday gifts poor jacob and ace they are victims of false allegations all 1 million of them are fiction ask diduzane "Yes Andy he is not required to remember everything

1:57:44,1:59:49, Blake yes indeed which means evennthough he remembered when he said it a second later he again forgot @Sifundo Mazibuko . LOL!!!!! "@Carmen the reason ""For the sake of completeness"":elbowcough:love all these phrases they taught us" "Andy why must he admit to things that had nothing to do with him  "Or ""I forgot that I remembered""... he said it in every way possible..." @Blake Yogi .

Lord help us! AMEN abc "@Gift I agree. It takes such brains to create this kind of scheme 8000 houses they forgot to build that's all 
2:16:40,2:17:58, Only confused people will vote for ANC AMEN abc when BEE is designed to serve the political elite while the true businesses that is spending thousands of rand to be compliant get tiny tenders that amounts to only a plate of food a day . @Kevin😭😭😭 poor old chap can't resist touching the mike when is under pressure @Tony that is his tail sign.

2:18:15,2:19:09, This oke got the Benjamin Button action going. hahaha lol Andre we need to punish them for not voting ANC The poor people.......no houses while contractors earned millions for doing nothing. The contractors have to be probed as well for their involvement in the scam. @Andre Gerber I don't think the world has such a supply... It is simple they did not build the houses and ran off with the money. A disgrace . If this is what Black Empowerment means...South Africa is in a deep hole. Maybe if the ocean was sanitizer... Amen Jacob enough 
2:19:10,2:21:02, @Gift Mazibuko The contractors were probably politicians masquerading as contractors. Yes and please tender outside SA zuma even forgot to pay maintenance for 16 of his kids let alone remember to build 8000 houses I just wish all South Africans can hear this ONLY MAD PEOPLE CAN VOTE FOR ANC hahaha Doctor lol Help me guys who must I vote on next election? "SA has a bigger problem This witness is trying to sanitize the situation 
2:21:07,2:22:38, When the poor in rural areas see those yellow ANC shirts they get excited and vote ... it's a shame because they don't see the light... ANC STAND FOR AFRICAN NATIONAL CORRUPTION DID YOU KNOW THAT? @ John Oupa thatis the problem. In rural areas most people don't listen to the Commission And RAMAPOSA IS JUST TALK SHOP "The irony of is that empowerment is to also stimulate the economy creating jobs and more suppliers  "Russell zuma told the commission he us suffering from amnes but could not remember the rest of the letters in the word @Blake Yogi that's the paradox that makes the situation complicated... people don't trust the DA and the EFF are warmongers... Also the other parties are also quite messed up 
2:22:52,2:24:07, That is very true Andre Do these people tell their children and grand children that they are CORRUPT mara? "In the last national election "@a b c @ Doctor start your own party and name African Natonal Collection..collect all the money will then vote for ...its possible tebogo they cannot remember to tell the kids 2 @Monica 😂😂😂 @monica WHY/ 
2:24:08,2:27:10, Coalition Gov would be the best way forward. Keep check on oneanother @ Monica 😅😅😅🤣 anc for ever we can not vote the white party for as long the as the economy is still with the manority in sa . If everyone in South Africa was given R2 million to change life was something better than facing high rate of employment and crime Oh no... another ANC disciple ANC MUST FALL @ Doctor just saying maybe this is your chance ...talk to Aunty Nomvula to sell her car ..register the party tell her she won't go to jail once you win...hahahaha ANC WINS ALL THE TIME. @Andre Gerber There's a case that the CC will hand down a ruling on in due course. The ANC is deeming coalition gov unworkable due to undue absence of its councillors in the council of Tshwane 
2:27:12,2:28:48, Prepare a plate of curry these sellouts will let you run the state/country. Our country is brainwashed into believing ANC is the only black party. And any other party would mean we give land back to the white minority I'd vote for a party that fixes the economy and gives out free burgers on Fridays... lol Ok... maybe the burgers are a lot ro ask for ANC is a USELESS PARTY THAT STEALS FROM THE POOR @ Jeronovin not this time .. @Ozzy Ozzy true that @a b c bc Forget about the burgers...lol "@ Monica 
2:28:53,2:30:57, Our once beautiful country is now dark and the laughing stock of the world. i pity the youth it is quite funny....the masses getting conned by their cadres @Cerebis 😅 Too many small parties in South Africa. What a pity they can't put their egos aside and work together in the interests of the country. @John Oupa Makgoka. that not how economies work. Mmmmmmm 2024 will be interesting however all the racial tension may also influence people's votes... though I'm for any particular party at the moment agree Carmen @visibly annoyed tell him... I don't know why people keep saying stuff like that 
2:31:23,2:33:35, Think carefully before answering Pretorius. He wont forget and he will uproot them lies @Andre Gerber Exactly they are determined to undermine coalition governance. What was interesting in those proceedings at the CC was they were not available to make submissions. What was that about? "Carmen James they all want part of the kookie jar  Time that certain people in South Africa stop believing in the money tree that keeps on giving? There is also no goose that lays golden eggs for free. NATIONAL PARTY STOLE IT FOR MANY YEARS Pity hardcore Anc voters don’t listen to commissions like this "All that's certain is that if something is not done @Thobani I did not follow the case. ANC wants outright power "If you pay careful attention you would notice that national treasury security majors were pathetic then as they still are today  
2:33:36,2:36:04, GUYS ANC HAS STOLEN EVERYTHING @Peter Staffen . Sadly we all lose😓 he is so involved in this ...sies he is playing a victim ..nxa No you cannot Parties win... but the people always lose... Imagine saying Chair said so "Lets all blame Chair "@JERONOVIN BAILEY Madiba said the the ANC must not do as was done by the NP of old. That did not work out well did it! The NP's corruption and evil is not on trail here "Mokhesi statement: It's fraudulent / Mokhesi testimony: Ja 
2:36:04,2:39:37, He bana this witness "The problem is not the ANC Admission of guilt 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Amanda. the signs of a liar deluxe @Gift Mazibuko He is redy for the jaill😁😆😅 "@Andre Gerber I followed all the way through. It's seems the ANC doesn't want to cooperate in coalition governance 😂😂😂 @Thobani Mkananda when will CC do verdict These a professionals of corruption Aces kids have joined ...Zumas kids have joined Nomvulas kids also the list goes on...so where to from here
