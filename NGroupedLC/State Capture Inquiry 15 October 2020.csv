16:23,18:03, replace the oxygen with nitrogen A specialist in labour law he also act as a judge at the labour court. I suspect he will bury Gama what do you think of the cANCer kickback scheme on News24 md "I know a lot of people who lost their Italian passports and they are behind bars But was there a conspiracy? mbuso are you legally blind? South Africa is our country That Ms Mbanjwa-I still wonder if she was drunk. But she signed documents for her client. Hofmeyer must fry her 
18:06,20:44, Whistleblowing appears to be the worst crime you could ever commit... This should serve as a deterrence to anyone contemplating of been a whistleblower in Sa .#Agrizi @ Diketso that's also my view How can you replace Oxygen with Nitrogen 🤷 because there is already 78% of Nitrogen 🤷 :sanitizer: agrizzi s water bomb 100% nitrogen in his supply @hirsitus Make him go faster! @win yep Agrizzi was denied bailed for lying to the prosecution and that did not assist with bail application. Agrizzis credit card had more than R4mil positive balance 
20:52,22:33, "2 for and the rest against What happens to agrizzi shows that no one betrays Mr Watson and get away with it. Mr Watson is laughing in Dubai now.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @mbuzo..watson is dead Yes we can draw inference from that.

25:16,26:22, A competent civil service must be built People hand passports over when they get bail so to hide that you have another passport is very serious. who be mr witness 2 day @ mbuso..your theory is far fetched..conspiracy theory bundle @Antoinette Meyer Director at Bowmans Gilfilan Attorneys: Mr Christopher Todd "@Mbuso Ndlovu Photo's on Google show him dead in the car Wonderful to have a witness who can promptly find the pages! Thank you Arnold @Brian to be expected he has experience perusing legal documents 
26:27,27:56, @Antoinette Meyer always a pleasure @Brian a breath of fresh air Eh Todd must not show off-Myburg is WAY more accomplished than him Wow We need Agrizzi in person in court to testify be cross examined to be able to have solid evidence against those implicated in state capture especially the top thieves I am hope his health improves Slightly unusual???

30:22,32:09, Without Agrizzi as a witness only his statements and commission appearance The court cases against the big guys and gals will drag on for years complaining that his version could not be challenged @EMANUEL KGAPHOLA Protect from what? "On the basis of data analysis and our understanding thanks @arnold We do have alternative party am afraid. @Douglas Masuku always a pleasure "@Heather you're welcome I dont think Agrizzi can bend over without cracking his skull. "The ANC used to be the barometer of government but given whats we heard 
32:21,33:13, malema:there is no scientific evidence that white farmers are targeted in SA @ Cruda Bex.

1:38:51,1:41:03, @Makhosini Zwane Depends on the time period... I'm specifically referring to the time of conquest and colonialism... but later on there were fair sales that were made... not sure exactly which parts a b c apartheid passed laws that enabled it to take land without paying it from its owners and that was declared as crime against humanity.as it was part of apartheid system @Naledi Barron A presidentialy (allegedly) sanctioned sociopath. @Sabelo Nxumalo Blame Jan van Riebeek for a start... @Tommygun Yup!! people were being dismissed by the dozen in this madhouse country. where were todd labour lawyer then? @Sabelo Nxumalo; it would snow the day we could logically address the issue of land and apartheid with our counterparts. Most just don't want to acknowledge the legacy that was left "@Sabelo Nxumalo True I think that it it can be proven by documentation then the land should indeed be restored 
1:41:08,1:43:22, The SOE's were run by thugs and kleptomaniac's "@Sabelo Nxumalo ...... and then incompetent people in government. so much vacant land ot there and they no not what to do with it . simple. give it to the people . @zip reeper Valid point. "@ a b c  @a b c I heard there are some land available to be occuppied mostly for farming purpose. i am not sure of the process. Human settlement again nah I blame our government and De Klerk and all those who supports these injustices happened to the black community as they agreed to embrace crime by denying black community rights to economy (land) @naledi settlers were uncouth vagabonds who could not cut it in europe Naledi they are all white😊 
1:43:40,1:45:22, "@Kutlwano Makhobotloane I suppose that's also true Let's just all agree that apartheid was one sick system to have happened in this country whatever the case guys corruption has no room in democracy agree This commision is a circus @mr zitha many blacks say things were better under apartheid "@zip reeper Yup. Whatever they were The black suprematist discriminate black dutch speakers "@ a b c ; I think the issue would be much much simpler if all races weren't chasing the furthest extremes. There is value in co-owning land 
1:45:38,1:46:25, @dee dee cocroft Not that simple a solution. @Makhosini Zwane You see that's the issue... remember that government can't just displace thousands of people to a land that is currently being used for food security... but it is complicated... @zip reeper some afrikaaners are supporting the eff now😊 Zombie Rockful we will ignore u if its a circus leave us and go watch cartoons @Kutlwano Makhobotloane Agree 100% "@Deidre Jacobs ; you might agree only those black in the buntu stance leaders would agree thst it was better in the apartheid days @Naledi Barron Absolutely...but a Rainbow minus the stolen colours unfortunately. Perhaps the reason for so much frustration and disillusion. commission is not a circus... unless you want the country to be run like a jungle where the law is.. survival of the fittest

1:50:27,1:52:01, @Jenny Whitewaves Sadly the past 25 years has shown us that all that is needed to capture the majority vote is the illusion called hope. Land has become a side issue amongst a few other illusions. @Naledi Barron thanks it is another 1/2 truth like the loss of grants if ANC not in power grammar hahahaha please let us show respect for each other. English is second language to many. The English do not laugh at those who have poor grammar. it's not fair to do that to others.. Jenny we want to be farmers.are our white farmers prepared to work with blacks as co owners of land? @Kutlwano Makhobotloane Indeed... and remember that we're in a generation where adults have grown in urban areas and know very little about land management or even farming... that's another issue If less money had been looted there would be more of an economy and more ambition that trying to eek out a living as a marginal farmer with a few chickens I want to build game reserve in northen cape and live in sandton or london Propose CCMA to be investigated "@Tommygun exactly

I'm not even really bothered who owns what @ a b c ; Sure man 😅 That's what I understood when you mentioned you knew black people who own farms Jenny how is the relationship between black farmers and white farmers? Nah let's not pretend... we all know full well that boers are NOT willing to co-own the land with blacks... that is just a fact guys... @Kutlwano Makhobotloane the governments extra mile for its people is extra looting "Todd answers well  @Kutlwano Makhobotloane Oh lol no! 😅😅😅 @zip reeper 👏👏👏 
2:02:10,2:03:28, when u tell the truth its easier to respond or give an answer @SanFran Arnold ; Which is why we're here 🙂 maybe a % should be given where ur farm/land has x amount of square km's not being used? @joyce tendai Zvavareyi yes the truth is such an easy story "@Sabelo Nxumalo They share experience and help each other. Some provinces are closer than others "@joyce tendai Zvavareyi U can tell he got nothing to hide @Sabelo Nxumalo if political parties e.g. The EFF would stop stirring up encouraging and manufacturing racial tensions for their own ends There wouldn't be so much tension @Kutlwano Makhobotloane great.
