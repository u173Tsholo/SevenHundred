1:32:07,1:36:57, Napers was created to be the mouthpiece / media platform to spread propoganda and uphold a certain narrative. Something that the ANC and black people are failing dismally in... Only thing I can think of is to but the country into business rescue under IMF and for democracy to be suspended until the economy is stabilised. Naspers speaks to its constituency wait bot the budget vote today guysüòÅ "@Stronger together hahaha "Budget is going to be a disaster "@mxolisi buthelezi Yes We will need United Nations to bring in peace-keeping force to maintain law and order because our police and army are likely to go on strike. ...The youth in SA will have to save themselves and rely on protestation to get the attention of those adults.

"The success of the Scorpions but he created the Hawks in return and the hawks did what exactly to fight corruption 
1:47:59,1:57:02, lol yea but then the hawks aren't really as effective as the scorpions "The scorpions were a Mbeki legacy which did not suit Zuma's intentions. The Hawks were his creation and he fswelled the ranks with his sympathisers they will be just give the teeth last year they filled almost 800 posts so this year the baby teeth should be canines "Yea we can give them time. but the fact remains that the scorpions was a very capable unit when Zuma disbanded it. What is the old saying..""don't fix it if its not broken..""?" Please if someone knows because we struggle since 2013 with the Department Rural development iin East London. It seems Zuma will remain trending for the next decade while our economy and land still resides in the hands of a few The many instances of negative news reporting by eNCA news against positive directions taken or to be taken by our government should also be brought under scrutiny. @Stronger together it would be nice if you substantiate that

"@Lady Bird so to the north Rob Nel clearly NOT ! He would have said it does not give @Lady Bird the right to tell black people how to respond to that situation. He is clear on that. 
2:18:03,2:21:09, ANC/SACP/COSATU have modelled themselves on the political elite in Soviet Union who used communism to enrich themselves at the expense of their gullible citizens.

Try to imagine yourself as an autonomous and unique individual. That is what ""empowerment"" is all about." Keith Din I am not eff member or supported but their ejection was unfair by EC speaker 
2:30:35,2:32:18, DOMINIC done that a long time ago ‚Ä¶.

2:34:26,2:36:23, How can we or I help Mbuso @Mbuso Ndlovu ?? The word racism is too widely and too often used today. It has lost all meaning. @Keith Din Who is this corruptionist testifying here EFF wears a uniform because they are quasi-fascist. Similar to the Brown Shirts. Hahaha... you mean haters ran out of data faster than those who're here to have a rational talk ? @Pastor J Why was the EFF evicted in the Eastern Cape? No speculation please. @yes. thats true Keith. @Gareth Hellyar That might be because racism is widespread. 
2:36:23,2:38:38, @Dominic Przybylski ....Heheheh....birds of a feather...flock together....ANC as well....heheh Its one of the SABC bosses that were quiet when they were seeing corruption happening @Mbuso Ndlovu @Ayanda Diliza not to mention that the 13% is all in land that is not usable Non-whites are uncomfortable when their 'masters' are challenged. @Keith Din They should all go to Robin IrelandüòÄüòÅüòÇ "EFF/ANC always talk about ""the masses"" they don't want anyone to think for themselves."

Those who lie also @Mbuso Ndlovu It's wonderful that racism and corruption have No colour.......can't play the race card here....it just won't hold........ @Gareth Hellyar Are you denying that racism is rife? @Keith Din ...way to go Bro... hi is too much a Are you racist @Derek Main ? Race is used to obscure the real problems of our country. As long as it is the basis of political power we won't be able to solve our country's problems. "@Gareth Hellyar I don't think so. If I have any racism in me 
2:41:05,2:44:15, @Gareth Hellyar ....Many many snowflakes in SA......just can't handle stuff etc...true She was on leave when Claudy Motsoneng signed the deal with Multichoice yesses who is the name of this lady....lets make her our president the way she seems so smart I am glad that you finally realised yeah @MIKE DURBAN ... we need some action and consequence management ! This lady was overlooked when she was the ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù of SABC But she kept quiet lol @Tshepo Mokoto Multichoice had captured the SABC and broadcast in South Africa Can't understand these so called South African leaders .... 
2:44:29,2:45:56, Yip @Tshepo Mokoto . Trying to paint herself white. @Gareth Hellyar To deny that racism exists is to live in denial. "so Oligopoly Mzalwana ... why she didn't said something that time .. People who do not follow South African news must not pretend as if some of these things were not raised previously. "she was not really a leader there outside the command of hlaudi motsoeneng who was acting in the capacity of board Multichoice is implicated heavily in wrongdoing. The CEO was and still is the Son inLaw of Gwede Mantashe. The same Gwede implicated in the Bosassa scandal "Keith 
2:46:12,2:48:03, That was when Hlaudi was in charge "It does @Derek Main . On both sides. Or Say it is'nt so Pastor J It is so@Lady Bird ...Sorreee I cant say otherwise Darling Racism is an inherent feature of SA. I am more comfortable with a person who acknowledges the inherited racist behaviour learnt from childhood & are trying to alter own beliefs than those in denial. @lufuno nema....she did and they pushed her out Google search her resignation in 2014. An article appeared in Mail and Guardian on 3 Feb 2014 "In this country Money money the root of all evil! 
2:48:15,2:50:41, The door never stops revolving@Lady Bird "'Mokhobo is said to be stepping down because her situation has become untenable'. M&G True. @Paul Buchel "We desperately need to escape our obsession with race. The associated emotions prevent us from looking at things constructively @Paul Buchel I agree it has a lot to do with respect and treating people with some dignity. "'Two centres of power have emerged at the public broadcaster @Mzalwane Mzala 101% correct Please lets all just stick with what is going on here. Reports have suggested Mokhobo has had her authority undermined on a number of occasions. It is understood that she has simply had enough of the political fault lines tearing at the organisation. M&G 
2:52:54,2:55:14, "I have always admired and respected this great lady after long time removed him that board though they were playing the Chess game towards their benefit forgetting they were a long time checked by that peanut head. Hlaudi. the clown. "Ideally @Pastor J she was also complicit-i dont see her as having the mantle to be a leader-Why did she not protest back then? I find Hlaudi very entertaining. Would love for him to come back. @Gareth Hellyar Careful what you wish for - you might get it. Remove Hlaudi 
2:55:20,2:57:38, Chairperson üòÇüòÇ Would be more entertaining this lady. LOL @Mbombo Maleka ...She actually did and it was widely reported. Read the chats by Mzalwana @Mbombo Maleka She raised these issues and finally left because the board was on Hlaudi's side. It was in the media in 2014 already that she left because of that. @Gareth Hellyar I thought you meant back to SABC but I guess you meant to commission. "Pastor J the fact that she could be pushed out is concerning  She did not raise this at parliament-i serve the PCC and she appeared many times-instead she would remain mute in the presence of Hlaudi and chrony ministers "Yes Thats why she went to the Media. She was helpless@Lady Bird 
2:57:49,2:59:48, that coo need to be taken to acountability...where is he nowü§î she was questioned deeply during the inquiry also and even broke down a coul=ple of times @mbambo I still remember Highest level of the country were involved That is the issue Pastor J . She should not have to go to the media . There should be structures inside . If that is absent thee is abig problem infact she was privy to some of the questionable decisions so i dont buy her crocodile tear-am certain they are in waiting as we speak pardon my bad spelling Pastor J padama charamadhara I blame my keyboard lolol 
3:00:05,3:02:36, She had no support whatsoever whilst the rest was corrupting the SABC@Lady Bird .Those that she could report to were the corrupt ones So board members were carrying out political mandates? @Mzalwane Mzala board members in state entities are political appointments Hit nail on the head @Mzalwane Mzala . so they pay their dues and forget fiduciary duties unfortunately Yes chair I know that they are appointed through parliament but they are not supposed to carry political mandates. But that's the Commie ANC agenda......control Everything.......true... No secrecy please
