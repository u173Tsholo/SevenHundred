JON JOHNSON @Diss & Dad and Bochum in limpopo Frankfort is a small farming town situated on the banks of the Wilge River in the Free State province of South Africa.

1:26:17,1:29:48, i won't call it strategic because they did not do this to their equals but to the vulnerable @ emmanuel chauke. "these crooks got nothing on Mandela .Biko SIsilo  "kkkk these crooks think nothing of the poor True Derek Main spot on My heart is at pain that Mkwebane decided to ignore all this simply at expense of protecting thieves who stole the poor people's lives. @david jacobs Tell these corrupt fat cats about nice suits and lying in front of TV camera Magupta how do we chant and insult someone who is telling the truth about what happened and we protect the corrupt people 
1:30:03,1:32:04, Our Government all of them must go to jail. our government is something else Disgusting what was Lesedi FM doing @ dt meeting? Ace must go to jail they used LesediFM to get people to attend 💔 assassinate ACE they must go to jail before they mess with our pensions if they havent already what you want?

1:34:13,1:35:36, I’m worried as well my brother @John Oupa Makgoka these days it is short @Diss & Dad You won't find those kind of people in the new ANC. The old ANC had morals and were prepared to serve the people. The new ANC vultures are only in it for themselves. "this is what malema and zuma is doing but sis Busi found nothing wrong the way Lesedi fm were so vocal abt ds project it raised too much suspicions.....can they talk abt their involvemnt in detail "mosebenzi zwane - he is just as big of a skelm if they dont go to jail then the pensions will be lost propaganda machinery @sebation nantsika 
1:35:38,1:37:50, "@david Jacob's Why everything can't just be in Zulu because they all understand Zulu to avoid confussion. @Davidjacobs so true Who are they pleasing in English @singi lol @Diss & Dad Yes - that and a T-shirt and food parcel. while commission going on they empty the coffers continually they dont even stop mazulu will confuse you big time no kwishishanyana lol

There are dairy farmers in SA who could teach them about dairy farming ..... 
1:39:48,1:41:30, @Lorna Kavanagh im struggling to come to terms on that too Lol @I am free i think cows in SA much better condition than those in india gangster state live🙈🙊 I'm enjoying babu zondo commission It was just an excuse to take his choir .... who got really sick @Talent P Sibisi why should i just learn isizulu while i'm still struggling to understand most languages surrounding me? "what happen to the legal route Ace was supposed to take on the book ""Gangster State"" any news on that" or was it just wind? 
1:41:40,1:43:15, @Boloka Madimetja whats your home language? Bell Pottinger created the wmc narrative so everything is blamed on it indeed its easier said than done@ david jacobs "@Talent P Sibisi sepedi Just wind @david jacobs how some journalist must ask him about that put the pressure on him 
1:43:52,1:46:03, @Boloka Madimetja here in KZN Zulu language is no.1 "to do what  "I must say i'm impressed by accuracy of the interpretations We need youth young leaders to take over these warm seats. Our tax money is being stolen every day in SA. wake up SA!!! This commission is a wonderful distraction yes "@Talent P Sibisi ok jail them now and ask question in court while they are being detained "@David jacob @Boloka Madimetja no I was just saying 
1:46:12,1:49:31, in 2020 more dirty laundry will come out from the current what's happening currently we are easily distracted by out leaders. "I think the polished head 🤥🚿is contributing to memory loss This was going to be a flagship project into dairy farming for the people in FS and now we wonder how will any farming project or land project will not fail as well ? @Talent P Sibisi ok We need women leaders who will care for us... @Lance Crawford anyone in mind? Yes women power @Lance Crawford Hellen Z. Thuli after Hellen 
1:49:42,1:52:21, @Bronwyn Esau you're joking right? @I Am Free Zumz also does that This live commision should be used to interview our women leader not try fix the past. @Michael Wild are u referring to Zille? agree @ Lance Crawford. unlike Constitutional delinquent mkhwebane who allowed herself to be used by these corrupt men. she will soon be on her own😱 Brazilian will take over for Brazilian hair yes @Singi Mathebula why are u convinced that she's a delinquent? Who is this white lady

1:55:52,1:57:02, @I Am Free exactly @Singi Mathebula what do u mean? This witness is highly disappointed about this project. He understands the malfeasance but now must give the facts in granular detail which is frustrating. Poor guy.
