Tune in to SA FM to deal with the sound issue SABC sucks nxa Doesnt sound like a cure. SABC wants to know why no one wants to pay TV licenses. Quality of broadcasting is at all time low

So whats the use of reading? Eishhh his eyes is scaring me really.. "after all is said and done 
32:18,39:26, Truth and truth alone will set you free. Also truth in this case shall set this South Africa free. Thank you @Thando Nkutha This is waste of time. what happen with Life Esidimeni @Lwandile Damane . Thats my opinion. Considering the Life Esidimini out comes. Qedani Mahlangu was re-elected at her position. And no one was arrested for the lost of our people. Ai Kanti were wasting time. Kakhulu @Mpilo Mthiyane "This time SA law will act accordingly "@Desmond Masilela  "@Desmond 
39:49,43:45, ramaphosa is very dignified .ubaba and his gangsters nearly killed the anc I fully agree with you 100% @Lwandile Damane no wonder why ace and supra are organising the mafias to fight back its because Zuma have got some dirts on him "ubaba was the best president we ever had "Inquiries are useless uBaba is an operative...a great leader. the corruption allegations just taint him. enquiry is waste of money people is paying huge money to taint ubaba image This inquiry also shows how uBaba was a REAL G😂😂😂 
44:03,48:04, The inquiry is not a court...it recommends... @Magic Thakeng but we have a right to know the truth regardless of the expenses.. @uBaba is the real OG!!! @Thando Nkutha uthini? Sound very bad! "Lol "prediction: Nene will be found to have been complicit in state capture @cecil thurston vanreenen ubaba was not and will never be the best president. They said he's all over them but yet nowhere... 
48:10,50:30, hey @Lizette van Greunen SABC cash strapped so let's bare with them lol. zuma is the worst president ever to come out of my Anc its only hitting him now that the guptas have stolen so much billions all the did is to give his kids crumps and they ram away with the real bread He was 1 of the best.. "on face value Noe we have to approach IMF... then block me Who cares about you....I dnt.. 
50:50,53:09, So thando is scared and a dictator??? "He was better than mandela spider-web :O And he's emotional??? Using appartheid tactics and has no balls??? Mourinho Out --- Agree? I dont need ur comments sir.. LOL...@Thando Nkutha Now back to business...I say under JZ there were no petrol hikes....I can barely afford.. 
53:46,56:38, Cyril enriched himself since 94... I enjoy clarity of presentation by Minister Nene the parastatals have collapsed because of him .so where must we get the money Prooof??? "We r still getting ther ask the guptas what they did at denel and the shelve company in china where they diverted the funds to dubai SOE were never meant to be profit making...their purpose to to meet the nation's needs of Employment and infrastructure without concern of profit margins... "All you guys know is the word state capture See????Phindile cant think beyond state capture.. 
57:19,59:23, "Do you know ""Bidvest???" 600 million? usually a benefector of corruption will fight to the better ends at the expense of their poor some people are exposing themselves on understanding on how politics affect economy Thats the budget of GCIS???? "It wouldn't have been a R600m transfer thats a lot of money... 600 mil wow Gives you an idea of how much money was taken out of the country through the Gupta's antics. "Also 
59:30,1:07:33, Why not? Did they ask him if he was ever at the Gupta Compound before he became the minister and after @thando nkutha all u are trying to say is that mcebisi.should have taken that evil money for us not to label him a liar the truth shall set you free Mr Nene from the red berets onslaught y PLO was deported from Zambia? all i knows is all in all someone would have had a courage to say no to the guptas .the anc of mandela would never have accepted what the Gupta's were doing in Sa.thanks to jonas can someone assist me as to when is this inquiry suppose to finish on msimango apparently it will take 2 years 
1:07:35,1:10:42, "No Today's meeting probably finishes at 5PM. The commission itself might take another month or two to finalise their report. This is not a soup. he should have let him answer Anyone with a crack of Filmora? So he wanted to buy us a refinery??? Whats the story with PetroSA and state capture? He wanted to buy us a refinery from some arabian dude.. some Arabian dude? I thot I heard so... 
1:11:04,1:16:49, Or from Saudi or sumthing... maybe we wouldn't be suffering petrol hikes could he have bought the refinery I think so... "They wanted to buy Engen Refinery S blind people always say... No..the refinery was being bought by Petrosa...so it was going to be a national asset....it was actually not a bad idea except for the fact that we wanted to pay 2X its value...overpriced that is "take a look at Operation Phakisa Engen= Petronas ......Mobil sold long time ago in 1992/93...... "Now atleast ppl r beginning to say JZ's decision was not so bad 
1:19:10,1:26:00, corrupt no 1 what's wrong about Cyril enriching himself if he broke no law or committed any crime "The proposal was not bad at al...in fact Some attack people for their success driven by vitriolic jealousy of ones success "Procedure was not follwed  @PHETWE thing is that we dont know who was going to own the asset government/Guptas. who knows the asset could have been bought at high price and sold to Guptas at price which is below market value. if there's any information compromising against Nene avail it to the Judge or open a criminal case than to play politics "I GUESS SOON WE WILL KNOW sound 
1:26:24,1:28:02, sound sound Sound? sound please!!!! sound sound What happened to sound? eeeeek sound

Believe me Nene has pocketed the R6m from Guptas. "Somewhere Nene is here to expose Zuma and Son and Guptas state of decay 
1:46:36,1:57:23, "EFF must take this Guy to Court those eyes what is happening the sound is poor 👌 Thinks are not so clear now... "let reframe from passing judgments "Apologies for the poor sound Male can sort him out @sabcdigital thank you 
1:57:37,2:01:21, @SABC Digital News Thank you!! Finally! the sound is back! thanks thanks sabc Now EFF must come explain and bring proof We need Malema to ask questions to this guy EFF have all documents. no malema should just bring the proof he claims to have. "they told him if he doesn't resign today 
2:01:29,2:07:00, so nene is lying ...eish mara these people are wasting time "We will wait for EFF "no matter what anyone can say i agree! "oh and by the way If EFF has all information must come forward not to make an accusation which is baseless they do so to gain more votes why is Nene reading his answers something fishy EFF must bring the evidence... one cannot make allegations and not have the proof ... We want all these corrupt individuals exposed Actually we can ... its the Fraud we cant. Im an Electrical Power System Engineer i can assure its the Audits were Rigged 
2:07:26,2:14:39, "guys do not be confusedwith EFF before testimony i mean sorry if eff have full prove they like to much to go upfront why they are not on the press conference ".. "Commission already had the evidence from EFF EFF + DJ Martinengo =🦍🐒 EFF was waiting for him to appear first and they'll speak after Nooo That EFF of yours think are smarter than who. What about their Dark secret. Renewable and alternative energy is so much cheaper than nuclear... But nuclear is required... a mixed energy grid would be great especially because fossil fuel is really expensive... 
2:16:24,2:21:51, nuclear energy produces nuclear waste. SA should stay away from nuclear energy. They missed the bullet with the apartheid regime acquisition of nuclear weapons from Israel to wipe out Africa. This whole excersize has a main objective. To allocate so called consultation fees worth millions. Its a blatant attemot to syphen out more state funds!! Sounds better now Will there be a conclusion that resolves this issue No it is not. The world is moving in the direction of non nuclear renewable energy. Anyone in possession of incrementing evidence to Nene present it to the Judge or forever shut up with gossips Read. I wrote that it would be presented as that. I did not say that blacks were incompetent. "if minister and former president Zuma are are attacking each other like this there are cheaper and bio friendly mesathods of energy production. Nuclear is NOT an option!!We have sun and wind as well as water energy generation resources to our advantage. DITCH NUCLEAR POWER! 
2:22:11,2:27:02, We moving to electrical vehicles we will need more supply... like I said a mixed source grid will be great for the economy... There is no such thing as black incompetence.. only poor leaders The Russians have nothing for them self. so how they can build anything in AFRIKA? look at there country. Africa and the Caribbean have the most conducive environments for solar and other forms of energy. We need to stop trying to be clones of the movements of others. "The issue was bypassing Solar especially because it was the most cost effective. but not conducive for labo Chief base Sheeben So Nhlanhla wasnt fired for not refusing to procure nuclear?? What is racism. Racism is the belief in human superiority. Stop echoing the obtuse revision of this practise. So u guys are disappointed??? I told you guys...It doesnt mean you are right just because you are a group???It just makes you a foolish group... If EFF have something they know they must come forward to the Zondo Commission. HAHAHA FROM THE THE THE FORMER PRESIDENT 
2:27:05,2:30:31, When you testify at any court you need to accurately so I don’t blame him reading his statements so that commissioner doesn’t correct him according to his statement this is where i learned that : goodread fanatics BOOK: The making of Russia: Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy: hate is a harsh word Jacob Zuma was not a bad President They commited (Thats what were ought to do) RSA1st ByAllMeansNeccissated "russia is a big place you cant hate everyone @Thabo Matlhabe The making of Russia: Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy: don't agree... he ruined SA... now SA is a basket case thanks to him... SA will become like Somalia... dont agree 
2:30:32,2:34:33, Lets Take Charge ts our Property. hard yards ahead but ships turning let's see what we can do to prevent that happening... imagine zuma won anc election Fraud like Cryli koi koi and san property only Not so! RSA Citizens I am of the view of Nene is a big liar. why you read things that happened to you instead of talking. Mcebisi never read he just talk because those things happened to him directly. "10 years from now if petrol is sitting at 25 
2:34:36,2:39:26, I agree with Eff to spell the beans for South African to see who is the liar about the State Capture When do we stop blaming Zuma? the world still blames hitler and most south africans blame apartheid - so - it never ends If it is not zuma is apartheid shifting of blame😎 when he is in jail When shall we stop pointing blêmes on Zuma the truth shall set him free Which decision did Zuma make that is still affecting us now @ Thando lets be respectful please. 
2:41:06,2:43:27, "In fact "@ Keatlaretse Thando all decisions that Zuma made while president are affecting us today and will still affect us tomorrow @Keatlaretse Phetwe procedure was not followed Its just ppl are not listening...Or just are obssessed with damaging Zuma's name.. "THats not the point Mogorosi The intention was the point... To defend Zuma says a lot about you but don't drag us to your level @MASAMBAG THAT IS SO TRUE 
2:43:45,2:44:34, "And another fact We should blame the petrol price to the government that adopted the ZAR/USD exhange and international crude oil price ...with this formula adopted by parliament .. it does not matter who is the presi Zuma damaged his name not people Zumas adminstration failed our country... Corrupt tribalists... Can't wait for the to probe transnet Of course these Communists are doing business with Russia. @ Thiza what makes u so sure that ur of higher level? "Thiza So much corruption. @Thabo Matlhabe we will know of those decisions once the commission has completed its business. 
2:44:43,2:46:11, Nothing wrong with comminism on paper but people do not practice it "I for one will defend my intelligence from being abused and insulted by those who saw what facts are you on about Keatlaretse ? "There most certainly is something wrong with it 1. nENE WAS FIRED FOR THE REFINERY DEAL... "Marxism is a disaster Are you listening to Nene. He refused to sign a letter to the Russian authorities that SA would not have to pay for the nuclear deal. What was the problem mos? Because facts are in front of us and if Zuma is of higher intellect let him appear before the commission or courts to clear his name What facts do u bring MASAMBAG.. 
2:46:25,2:47:21, but Nene has just told the country why he was fired and why do you dispute that ? I disagree with you Jeremy "Don't sign anything with those Russians; you'll really be speaking State capture Birds of the same feather always flock together I still believe nuclear was gonna benefit our country. Why was he fired? "I bring no facts I know it would.. "Look at every nation that has implemented it 
2:47:25,2:48:48, gone. .. By saying wat MASAMBAG? "Fine if you're in possession of facts come before Zondo and subject yourself to cross examination Marxism misses a few things. One thing I remember from a scholar of Marxism is that is lacks morals and ethics. "Avoid being emotional "Mao said the same thing Nene refused to sign the Nuclear deal. How does this prove that Guptas captured the state? 
2:48:58,2:49:59, The evidence thereof is the 50 million murdered by Stalin "I don't think the argument is based on whether or not the nuclear deal was going to benefit the country And others "1. Nene has indicated that the country was not going to afford the nuclear deal "You must allow people to self-govern and regulate It's not a debate but discussion and the difference between is debate deals with untested opinions that never matter while discussion is driven by facts "We know that MASAMBAG Jeremy you wrong... Where in the world has the west not interfered with communism??? Sanctions Wars Assassinations!! History is written by the winner "Indeed
