time,17:26,message What happened at the Vrede Farm? Gwede mantashed😂😂 im back truth or dare there was a bantu on my gate "typical case of ""dont take responsibility"" report a problem and dont follow up - I did my part" @greg its the Bantu way plz now don't confuse her nw 
17:52,22:36, okay🤔 @greg steward bantus are like children wislima wena thula so this guy Fils de l'homme is calling people Bantu as a replacement mechanism- we see through your BS ashlee what u talking about mentor doesn't want to commit to her answers what would you like m to call ppl? "block fils he's crazy just google the meaning of bantu 
22:54,24:54, cross examination will liberate us. I observe that white people in general suffer from a superiority complex eish why are we still calling him the president!!! the meaning on google and the way you use it are not the same "ashlee u are fils what is bantu? Fils has no idea how racism manifests itself in south africa i speak of ppl in terms of the cultural belongings 
25:02,30:06, "no one said you are racist "nope.The Bantu peoples are the speakers of Bantu languages if this commission is honest former president should be arested it could have a négative connotation but it shouldn't be négative "abongile @abongile if evidence was beyond any reasonable doubt then we wouldnt have needed a commission to start with. So on my FB oage I predicted Vytjies evidencecare all based on her FB page postings? Just block that Fils let the commission make a recommendation for arrest ! 
30:13,39:28, rakeep so u think u r smart now Fils is racial be deceive on your dates "with what has been presented so far understooded? 🙄🙄🙄 Social Media is binding in so many ways. Even your VISA is linked to your facebook account "@Ntokozo  it is clear now if why president Zuma wanted a period of 6 months when the ANC tolled him to resign volluntary.........He wanted to cover his scadals with the Guptas Fils de the information found in this commission is going to use in court of law for those who committed crim 
39:29,43:06, She is getting drunk of this Mp 4. 6.1 issue alshabaab so they can't b arrested then y are we having a stateCapture? qarax "The Bantu peoples are the speakers of Bantu languages @vinolia they will be arrested akakhoni kufunda Mentor - lamafarikigi afile This is a funny democracy ntokozo r u laughing 
43:23,49:48, kkkk ziya kubuyela cc this is not madibas democracy @Fils de l'homme yes i am. wat goes around will come around we want o know what is advert now ... eix Why is this advocate interrogating a whistle blower like she is a criminal? This will discourage anyone with information. unokuphaphanyana yet incompetent "@Bongani Zondo is boss 
50:10,59:33, . leave hr alone she will find it hard to cope during Question TIME... ey theres a somithing making a weird sound "please note: there's nothing that you do in the darkness that won't be revealed in the light supposed offer made to you??? wow the advo is bought by the Gupta How does he know an offer was made if it hasnt been established and tested that it was? if she was a chair of parliementary for four years than the président would have known her "ntokozo 
1:02:00,1:07:35, ĺ Maybe Zuma does not recognise her anymore "@Musa im saying her story will be thrown out of court attendance register hum zumanine sad but anc sounds totally rotten All those asking for inquiry will end up regretting it -JGZ the anc must handin all their minutes of their meetings for the past 14years @Arthur S'fiso Gumede wenzani la mkhulu? they looking at the credibility of zuma now 
1:08:02,1:10:12, Zuma was always ahead of time. anikaboni niks. "if Zuma says he never knew her n the minutes show otherwise "nnltokozo "H edid not say he doesnt not know here The ANC is the people @Greg Stewart "ntokozo LOMAMA UNYANISILE INYANI IYACACA NJE ZUMA WAS CAPTURED this witness implicated lots of people.and they all have to come and object. 
1:10:41,1:12:25, "zumamine will need to explain himself "@ntokozo mncube U people must be careful for what you are writing here because you might have to answer about it in the court of law. gigaba was denying many things. now vytjie revealed him. he is such a big liar Zondo is not on facebook "philani I wanted to add him he invited her to china how come he doesnt recognice her @Fils de l'homme Can I add you on facebook? 
1:12:38,1:16:00, yes silverster Your facebook name? @Fils de l'homme "for anyone on the testifying list This advocate cannot interrogate a lay person. she speaks like she is talking to another advocate. "godfrey Thando i agree.tsunami is nothing compare to what is coming "i wonder how she's going to copy under cross examination @Fils i doubt godfrey r u lawyer? 
1:16:40,1:19:08, "she isn't coping well  she is fine no bt the witness testimony is not credible enough to lead prosecution the court allows for human failings i think there is a lot that she is saying is true "@godfrey do you not agree or do u agree with me Fils? the Zuma n his group will try to attack her credibility by diverting n not deal with the issue i find her credible and please remember she has to worry about security all the time. 
1:19:13,1:20:25, "i dont agree i agree that she is a credible witness statement at home hahaa must be joking @Fils I doubt. Let's wait I feel Zuma is ready trust me she is credible Credible witness? Kwaaaaaaaa kwaaaaa aii "We should not miss what the terms of reference for the commission are; this is not a court of law zanoxolo being ready with lies ofcourse I think it's sad that political parties are fighting whilst all this is happening. Could deviate public interest in this case 
1:21:09,1:23:03, lol home statement in her comfort of a her home hehehehehehe @Fils 🤷‍♂️ i think u just biased n dnt realy care abt the credibility of evidence presented. haha she is guilty as all of them Sis V might be unsettled here at the commission but that doesn't mean she is lying in her testimony... "godfrey Vytjie is a boer or colored ? thanks Mosetja vitjie is definitely not a bantu name

HAWKS😎 
1:35:58,1:37:18, Vytjie Mentor separated from her husband after accordig to her post of April 2018.

1:39:43,1:41:02, holla Millicent the name that doesn't appear even once at the bible lo The advocate yesterday she says she will need only half day today. but she almost took the whole day. I supposed even tomorrow we might wake up with her> SABC employees do not even watch their own channels 😀😂 cheating there reading her answers so impressed with the advocate. SABC employees do not take their employer seriously 😀😂 @Desmond Masilela mrs VM is so slow like a crab lol @masilela why u reminding me that? cos real thats what's she said lol LOL@Isaac Phumudzo .....hahahaha

1:43:41,1:46:19, @Desmond Masilela ---- Amen ! haha❤ hello everyone who like Gupta's family "im wondering now if msholozi claims not to know this lady remember she has to recollect what happened in 2010 give her a chance we are all human @Sofia spot on lol @Winston on point thank you 
1:46:31,1:47:54, How many of you remember the 2010 World Cup ? why didn't she ask a copy of her handwritten statement then? I don't think it easy for anyone to sit there. at least the poor lady is brave enough to come on board to give us her own testimony though it possesses some discrepancies. 7 years is too much If this woman would be allowed to have so many memory lapses then Msholozi will also be allowed not to have ant recollection of her Paul she knows everything there is no need to recollect here @Millicent ..then I will conclude and say Msholozi is not ok ..up there @ntokozo mncube you are being very naughty with that last comment 😂😂😂😂😂 It should be easy for her to sit there. she use to sit with Zupta''s @Marvel Ramatshela ntokozo recollecting times n datez is not th same remembering ppl 
1:47:58,1:48:57, "Msholozi is a mafia 2010 I only remember chabala's world Cup goal and few fascinating things😁 """... I wanted to trick him...""" 🤣Will the old man duck and dive as he has done so many times "2010 It would be interesting if the Guptas appear before the commission This time .. there is no way @Marvel i find very strange in her to remember every single details o fb but struggle here I wish they re-instate RAPE case...
