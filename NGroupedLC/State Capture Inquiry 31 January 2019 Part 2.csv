"He looks more like Chris Hani""s killer" he looks like Oscar Pretorius @Amanda He looks like this other coloured guy. He acts a lot in these old Afrikaans dramas. Forgot his name. 
7:41,8:33, he looks like Walus .. Have this people come out of their own volition or have they been summoned? "The only IT person @Ewald Kruger Leon. Not Andries. This guy was summonsed a real all in one @Chuma Mtyelwa 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 "Ewald They must summon all of them! 
8:38,9:23, @Thando Nkutha Both of them are Van Tonder's He's the son to Panic Mechanic from yesterday They must summon Patrick Gillingham! "HE IS VERY SCARED LOL And Mti who's the adv? agreed thando i wanna see her volume plzz 
9:23,10:02, Ms Buthelezi They must summon Monkonyane's daughter! "But these Bosasa characters he cant smile as he is about to incriminate himself "this guy is going to commit suicide he doesnt look strong movie: no - you need series "Tjo weee "I Don die deeler is net so goed soos die steler... 
10:05,10:43, this soap could put sabc back on the map "Thanks Guys why is that it is ONLY whites in this BOSASA enquiry Thando they look alike "THIS GUY IS ABOUT TO BE GRILLED LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE he is white vol still v low.....were the technicians SABC SABC won't afford to pay those actors!

I can't deal hebana PLEASE INCREASE VOLUME ADMINS!!!!! Funny how Bosasa still relied on White men to do their evil deeds - wonder what their BEE status was lol ET sound plz sabc @Thando Nkutha I'm not sure. 
12:13,12:59, PROMOTION WITHOUT QUALIFICATION EQUALS BOSASA "Stuart "the volume is quite low @Sthakathi Khumalo he is trying to confuse the evidence leader with that tie AWE sidney demoted now i talk aweh Tiaan lol Lebo! She looks and sound nervous😢 
13:00,13:51, @Antonie Goosen Remember Agrizzi said their BEE status was a lie. This commission turn out to be more like a Bosasa enquiry it seems the Adv must do better HE OR SHE NONKANYISO ? "thando cezula loools It doesn't matter as long as he is talking! Sondolo Sondolo? What's that? What does Sondolo mean? 
13:57,14:42, "He gets employed @Thando Nkutha Maybe they are. @ Yandi Masina Makes sense as management seems to have been entirely white - and still they got tenders lol Sondolo IT. "Don't worry guys Okay i admit Ms Buthelezi uyathithiza Seems same Van Tonder family @Thando Nkutha ​Someone said they look the same @Yandi and looking closely they do look alike Sondolo is a subsidiary of Bosasa....they had many companies @Nthabiseng Malebo if only 90% of politicians realised they were incompetent 
14:45,15:58, Sound is low its not about competence of work its about competence of keeping secrets and being trusted on the shenanigans they were doing Thando lol so the guys at the video were not part of management ? "Mfundo watson mafia whose ADVOCATE is this ?? why abuze ngathi uyesaba Evidence leader ugqoke kahle!! iVoice yakhe kodwa ayikhona!! "I THINK BOTH OF THEM ARE SCARED 
16:01,17:15, Watson ran Bosasa with an iron fist from what I can gather...all of tge witnesses says the same thing He suffered his fathers sins. he looks like VT from yesterday guys Bloody ungrateful. he is complaining but he was taking money all the way. Gavin should employ me. Loyal all the way. "@Antonie Goosen Yes. He said it was fake Yes! @Amanda Bentsile Whats up vele? add more bro "@Ewald Kruger Bosasa was a family thing nepotism played a huge role ko Bosasa I dnt know bra yoh uyadika 
17:15,17:56, The other Van Tonder was ET's father "Yip watson ran a moerse Spzaz "Watson wanted to give everyone a chance @Magda Seguin Not to mention the fake companies. I like Watson too. Wats on Gavin? What is this guy actually testifying - we not interested in their employment history Is Watson the owner of Bosasa or is he's just a CEO 
17:57,19:11, Atleast they were being abused and paid well "There you have it He is the co-founder of Bosasa without signature rights imagine I think it is about the IT provided to the bribed entities you dont wanna ask the Adv check or savings when she want to pay... the untouchable Gavin Watson hmm 😀 Saba belungu Richard Mti and Papa Leshabane are in deep ish😂😂😂😂😂 
19:26,20:35, Quite right @Yandi Masina We must arrest he is untouchable 😂😂😂😂 @Eslon Eslon He was the CEO Why has there been no search and seizures of Bosasa offices yet...the SIU and Hawks have evidence for decades i think this inquiry is just a wast of money. This one was not paid that well. No fat cat here "When the sea clean its self Co-founder without signature what does mean?@Khumalo 
20:36,21:28, eNCA is no longer streaming? "Guys. Mti ayosaba amabununu dobuladula Nthabiseng hy is biki maer ja @ Magda Seguin they have protection from high profile ANC members @Magda Seguin They were investigated - they deleted stuff of their computers and paid politicians to squash dockets @Eslon: al in the mind... they owned nothing Nthabiseng Malebo😂😂😂 "@Magda Seguin There's been investigations etc but NPA would tip them off

Last number! All along we were throwing stones to the Guptas while Bosasa the main culprit was in the game long time This is just like when they catch mafia members do you want to go to jail or do you want to rat to save your skin Yes Eslon Agrizzi uhh They just want to implicate Watson these ones

The guy seems to be lying THABANI NOKEVA CPUT 😂😂😂 @Nokukhanya Thembane thats what i was about to say why even deleting from the first place This one is not a credible witness...

46:27,47:05, all of them cant answer simple questions because they dont understand english He does not want to incriminate himself his kying @Zukile Ngwena not at all Sound?! ndaa! listen to the question attentively Sir yes Timothy Allies hi david 
47:06,48:03, yebo Ndosi It's hard to hear all these Bosasa witnesses are the group of whistleblowers Agrizzi mentioned now where is Adv. Molefe??? @THABANI NOKEVA Because the SIU wanted to see what was on their computer "he deleted this man is CLUELESS "i do not think anybody is lying here I also think that it's difficult for him to express himself in english 
48:07,49:11, audio not the best This one was atleast wise enough to make copies I hope he has those copies in his possession till day "@ Ewald this guy believe in telling lies Audio is low today They should have allowed them to speak in Afrikaans. increase volume "Mr Chair Sound - please turn it up 
49:15,50:06, sound please @Eugene Ntela I agree with you. THIS GUY UNAMANGA I THINK🤐 Subpoenas are starting to have effect The sound is too low. This witness is either nervous or lying I think he is smart Where are the copies Oompie? "He's not lying There were other docs not only ywo documents - two backups. 
50:14,50:53, Please increase sound he is nervous I think Watson is watching all this chat ..

"lol if he is watching this chat 
50:54,51:48, because size matters Agrizzi got them all out and now they are paving the way out Chair likes taking over the evidence lead whenever it is this lady that leads evidence 🤔 @Timothy Allies 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀🤦‍♀ He said that the SIU was onto Bosasa...he was protecting himself @sipho cebo lol..watson is definitely watching this chat😀😂 @Nokukhanya Thembane i he gives you a bag .. what do you give in return? @sipho cebo 😀😀Watson watching and he'll victimise Were the black directors at Bosasa real directors or were they just a front to generate cash? 
51:55,52:19, @Motshekgetsi Daniel Motale he is taking notes Quite right. And Zondo is clueless about IT @Thando Nkutha​ See this is not a lie He is vele his stress levels are high@sipho cebo I hope they come to testify so we can hear their story. I am a scientist I can make his mpimpis vanish lol Something 🐟 the last time he even apologized for this "Mhmm @Lebohang Mathibela they were the smoke screens not directors

They where not told at the start that it is a criminal run business. @Thando Nkutha you can ask again. 
54:42,55:16, Do you think so. "After this State Capture's investigators are also going to be offered bribes to get rid of the evidence. "@Sipho Cebo Is this lady a wife of IFP president?😂😂😂😂 who is thz now i just joined ] @Michael Wild True. Watson groomed them over time. "@ Yose @PlaneLess Pilot yep and nowhere to hide hey. 
55:19,56:32, Did I miss anything?? Because they either don't understand what he is saying or how computers work 😃 @Thando Nkutha​ Why do ppl say his laying? "Tjo @Sthakathi Khumalo Yup biggest Tsotsi but he was instructed by the connected Watson gang! @yose not now again pls "@yose @King Vuka Nothing much.

I don't think he is lying but he trying by all means not to be jailed on his statements that he is making i think man should interrogate man and women interrogate women Mme Buthelezi needs the toilet yose you sound like a european DEMON bring back our Molefe "@Mpura Carlos boss 
58:26,58:48, Yose😈😈 The examination leader not fit for this job Zondo wanted to confuse this guy to say things he wanted to hear. He's certainly telling like it was.
