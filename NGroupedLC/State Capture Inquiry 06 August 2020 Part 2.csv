14:10,17:45, Zondo for president yes me as dp again I wonder if people know that eyes speak louder than mouths "@Zim news @Akhonamandla Gala - he only just woke up "@ Myburgh Robben Island is not only known for the prison . . it also delivered the most millionaires per sq meter than any other land mass. That should tell you something! I'm not white my grandfather is a sotho Myrburch I don't care whether you white or green 
18:10,25:30, Sibusiso he is corrupt that's why he is failing to stop corruption. 😂 "when they said to ace your son's cannot receive tenders from Gov he said ""why not others are billionaire from Gov tenders"" and ace is right. he ment cyril. Sibusiso" @ Myburgh Is Batohi corrupt she is also failing to stop corruption? "Wesley I think Cyril is outnumbered in the NEC for him to apply what he intend to do  the ANC makes it impossible for anybody to stop corruption because everybody in the ANC is corrupt Sibusiso "@ Myburgh be cautious of your generalisation  Dep Chief justice Zondo is the man.. Cyril Ramaphosa is corrupt!!!!!!!! 
25:40,29:24, "Batohi was deployed to protect Pravin n the current sitting President Sbusiso politic is a dirty game waste of a billion Another rule: don't present documents with a dark background. @Thembeka🤷‍♂️ Haak Free State it's not hate speech our biggest problem is the ANC. ALL of them even Pravin. All of them. look beyond Black and White and Indian???!!!??!!! evidence will set us all free... Thieves are Swallowed by Evidence..

1:59:38,2:05:10, even Lindiwe Zulu daughter opened businesses when she was small business minister @Wesley Myburgh Which sons of Cyril got business from the state and from which department? “Pay me what you owe me!” 😂 lawyer dry humour is the best! It sounds like most of South of Africa government is corrupt. You all need to protest the ANC. Stop voting for the same political organization expecting a different result. "@Myburgh it's TRUE concerning Lindiwe Zulu  "Next question Why is there no single case concluded by this commission for us to see the wheels of justice crushing and grinding the guilty? This is aggravating cheap talk by the president who I think must resign. R600k to entertain his guests 🤼‍♂️🤼‍♂️🤼‍♂️🤼‍♂️🤼‍♂️🤼‍♂️🤼‍♂️ 600 000 debt of liquor?

2:07:49,2:09:28, ANC cadres the way they're misusing state resources it clearly shows that they're naive... @Luvuyo Zantsi is right to ask Wesley to explain his lies about sons of Cyril Ramaphosa doing business with the state. "Zulu's voice is very low and I battle to hear him We need a permanent corruption commission to expose these state looters. Why is 600k on alcohol something difficult for many to understand? this sounds plausible how do you take out 600k from a liquor store and still continue to run the business? SARS must check him out I can't stomach such lies "i am from BD  SARS check tax for R600 000 payment. 
2:09:52,2:12:37, "Is SARS present "When they Squeeze the truth out of you ANC its not political party bt TAX syndicate No documentation to prove "@Mandisi plausible maybe but remember the margins on liquor are low SARS your customer:yougotthis::yougotthis::yougotthis::yougotthis: "It's bad DG lost this argument you know how much booze you need to go through to rak up 600k margins are low on alcohol 
2:12:51,2:16:33, 604k Sibusiso Lindiwe Zulu's daughter was the only one who profited from her being small business minister. cause real small business entrepreneurs got no assistance from gov. in her time sad "From DG of a Government department @Myburgh not only the daughter but they had ventured with Mandela's grandchildren and Lindiwe Zulu sons as well @Wesley Myburgh No son of Cyril Ramaphosa is doing business with the state. Tell the truth. "Malena also Mzala do your research Mzala how did Ramaphosa become a billionaire??? the witness came ready for the advocate 
2:16:35,2:20:11, I have done it. Which son? Which department? Those are easy questions. Before you run away tell us which son? @Myburgh I'm not saying they were corrupt but they benefited from small businesses funds Which state department? the one who did business with bosasa @Wesley Myburgh That is Andile Ramaphosa and Bosasa is not a state company. Which government department did he do business with? Am interested in his annual turnover that year ? Are there other customers who owed him half a million + This is still going on...Enough with this waste of time! Molo mfundisi @Bongani Finca 
2:20:13,2:21:56, @Wesley Myburgh .......Reckon all the investigators gotta do ...is follow the money....just assuming... Zondo is on fire... YES "The R600k is an illegal payment  For all we know many people were probably paid to keep them out of prison PAYMENT IS PAYMENT He must produce invoices and also his tax records. "It's funny Mzala and liquor purcase invoices 
2:21:59,2:25:09, NO THIS ONE WAS A BROWN ENVELOPE It's only because they got caught that they have to go through this formality 🤣🤣🤣 I am still waiting for you to tell us with which state department did Andile Ramaphosa do business? @Wesley Myburgh "How much more stealing and corruption is going on that we don't know about? Like Jacob Zuma lol @Wesley Myburgh ....A Commie ANC wonder kind...... HANDLING PALE AFFAIRS iyooo they steal with impunity this is disgusting🤮🤮
