The NP walked out after about 18 months then guys these smaller parties should work harder in winning over new voters. but I do not trust the EFF as kingmakers because they misuse that power for their own benefit not for the people "what SA needs is what we are now... our parliament politics is balanced... in our country @Dominic Przybylski politicians wants to control people. "SA politics is at its best now
