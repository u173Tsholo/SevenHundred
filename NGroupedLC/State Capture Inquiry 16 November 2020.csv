Big surprise Dcj Is no puppet If Zuma doesn't want to present his side of the story then that's fine. It's not like any of us expect him to tell the truth anyway. This is going to be like New Years Eve 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 Curfew i have no sound

They sound toxic "If you believe your own lies Zuma is not going to testify this Sikhakhane telling us I was waiting for this Lol....

The strategy here is to convolute the masses since the trial is in the public domain "My one question is Switch on the aircon if the climate is not right ok start with the threats now you crossed the line "Zuma with his big gold watch given to him by the Guptas Skhakhane Commission now🤣 We didnt expect anything from him 
2:13:12,2:13:24, The country deserves to have Zuma appear before the Zondo Commission ! skhakhane is so Great bully boy Adv "has anyone heard a valid reason yet "Its too late for that leadership pa excellence Alvino - Agreed big like your head "My one question is

Why Zondo is using so much gloves on this Zuma guy? testing Zondos testing testing testing becoming arrogant @Reece petersen Being a former president. Yes he still received a salary. I wonder how he ended up in this position 🤔 "as soon as another judge is appointed that question JZ about state capture they will jump up and down and say ""unfair "time's up Adv They lack the guts to be under our law and will likely be fugitives if they are complicit. Basically the commission is happy with the evidence of state capture by those they like.. but opposed to those they like.. Rest sIKHAKHANE his blowing hot air🤒 
2:13:51,2:14:03, @Reece petersen I believe so At last....the comments Let him claim the right to remain silent-I dare you Sikhakhane nooo man Now this guy is dishing out threats he knows very well that the judge wont recuse him self Zuma is not prepared to testify...let them go.

OK : So When / If He Gets To Have JZ On The Stand; He Must Be RUDE and Tell Him That He Izza A-Hole So FAIRNESS Can Be Seen Why did the Adv not get to the point but took hours to preach and supposedly teach about law. "Reading comments here "I will not use the word ""improper"" is a way to try to muddle the subject." STORY STORY STORY GET ON Mr Skhakhane would allow your ci

2:30:19,2:30:37, @chimbuzi1 - People are being biased. I mean Skhakhane is making great points here and people are dismissing them because they have already taken ZONDO's side. oh now we need to look at nonverbal subcodes and tone ! lol Extract one issue and create a statement once a thief always a thief taking out of contect is what the lawer is doing Sikhakhane is simply trying to use as much of the commission's time as he possibly can. Insulting to every South African. MOURINHO TACTICS - PARKING THE BUS & RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK 🕒🤥🚌 drowning man catching at any straw! The last thing Zondo must do is to justify himself to this lawyer 
2:30:37,2:31:00, "No connection so far This lawyer not only is arrogant he looks the part too @Salmaan I agree with you Your points are weak sir I now get why most wealthy people shy away from from black lawyers.

2:38:53,2:39:08, how is another judge going to change the thugs (zumas) case.He is guilty is charged .Otherwise he will put his case forward zoma had an opportunity to cross examination all People who spoke wrong against him Gupta and Ramaphosa were gunning for the same contracts shut the fool up please Vetkoek any inclination is never an intention the witness could or not have been drawn to a particular suggestion this to draw pieces of what was said and put of context for me it some stick "Well if we left our seats as victims of state capture and assumed Mr. Zuma's shoes as the accused in these proceedings who is well within his rights to defend himsel "Zuma had set his record straight 'I'm not afraid to go to jail' "He is going around so much 
2:39:08,2:39:29, IM ALSO DIG GOALS.

2:39:29,2:39:46, He's misswing the point Zondo made stooooooooooooooooopid chair my client clearly isn't the only who has attempted to capture the country so he should not face the consequences "Mrs Jones Maintenance for Thobeka Mabida this guy is just annoying skekane is trying to act like an intellectual .he is buying time 'Gold digger' is a hypothetical straw man argument. When did 'Zondo' say she's a gold digger. State capture in the context of South Africa means that private individuals had an influence over the operation of government. Corruption occurred in the context of state capture. 
2:39:47,2:40:09, HAIBO 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Skhakhane is far beyond the thinking of many. #mzi in other words proof to me that you are not a gold digger Sikhakhane SC is now abusing the court with his conspiracies DCJ superior logic you digging skikhana This guy is WASTING TIME But the DCJ will never make such a comment.

SCH is on trial here. how he becomes a man on the street is on him ZONDO is too relaxed today great for rem deep sleep DCJ yes yes Gold digger is irrelevant much like all of the lawyer's arguments deputy chief justice is in charge a judge can give that answer - how you make a comment is important Ho Hum... Mr Skhakhane you have made your point can we continue with the business of the day DCJ's thinking is clear. 
2:40:41,2:41:03, They have cordial relationship period. State capture is a type of systemic political corruption in which private interests significantly influence a state's decision-making processes to their own advantage KZN VS KZN Both are out of order lols Rud Hollywood that is because he's not saying what you want to hear😅 all states are captured so no one should be accountable~ Skhakahne It's been 2 hours now and he's been bluffing you are no president lol "oh skikhana 
2:41:05,2:41:19, Skhakhane must not select quotations without him telling us what informed the comment. DCJ is taking it like a man...humble is zuma coming today???

2:45:28,2:45:38, ANC : death and destruction "I would hope all people are equal before the law whether they are former presidents  "Any state capture is undesirable .

SENSITIVITY!!!!!!! laughing at the fool lawyer use gold digger argument again Insensitive 
2:48:34,2:48:43, ANC = Faction murders What a load of BULL .... stalling tactics. Why should Zuma be treated differently to other crooks he know and you know he is stinking guilty When the ill person has faked a swimming pool into a firepool there is a history of faking. Skhakhane is milking the bull now Then any judge would have the same view "imagine if this was Judge Maseneke ANC = child abuse Take him to the pound and put him down. 
2:48:43,2:48:50, if the recusal is denied. my President will just get ill then.

"Zuma  LOL THE RACE CARD MANAGED TO FIND ITS WAY he is bringing Race in this Zuma never gave a serious testimony So all along the so-called Zuma bravery was just engaged in chest beating bravado signifying nothing. We live in a constitutional democracy and not a feudal state- egalitarianism at the core. If I remember well when Zuma was here on this first time kept saying he doesn’t know or remember very simply things: shall anyone believe him? Zondo =ANC appointed by Zuma 
2:49:37,2:49:41, guilty racism is there.. 🤔🤔 Lol Red card I blame Jan Van Riebek no race card its a fact ANC = Chasing Thuli Madonsela Why the phobia of a slaughterhouse if the witness is sure of his track record? kampe umkhaya.wakhe uzondo.lona ubaba uskhakhane here we go
