I had that some of the Judges are captuerd jst joint ü§îü§î Zondo can actually see he doesn't need this glasses Why former President wanted Nxasana to be guilty whereas courts acquitted him not guilty no squabble I don‚Äôt understand but himself sitting with there with lot of allegations on corruption and fraud @makhosi nobhatyi : It is said that the rumor spread was that Mr. Nxasana would prosecute the former state president. Gavin Watson faked his death Former state president used those rumors very funny coz president had no basis to fire mr Nxasana he was desperate to find something to linked mr Nxasana guilty @ Phillip Cwazibe @ Phillip Cwazibe Thank you 
50:38,1:00:11, Watson was due to answer Tax evasion questions at the commission the day after his alleged suicide. Zuma The enabler of corruption "I‚Äôm lost To give evidence "@ Mbuso Ndlovu Thank you Zuma was scared of prosecution Wow!!! After this session @ Maxwell Sibiya thank you @Makhosi

Did Magashule confirm to appear tomorrow?? "Where will Magashule appear - if he does Hayibo @Bonolo Easy Masomeng. Was there a request for him come tomorrow?

Bev he will but dont think he will last for 2 hours in that chair.bcz he is a pathetic liar Or a report @Bonolo Easy Masomeng... We are exonorating the Anc "i tell you people Pressure from Jiba and Mwrebi "@ Bev Daniel I don‚Äôt have doubts about Ace Magashule is very nice wider to dye Addis Abba No exoneration for the corrupt ANC 
1:52:35,1:56:23, JZ lied again how many lies must we hear about him without any consequence Zuma the career killer. JZ was never capable of written correspondence he does not have that level of intelligence. He is a master @ Diwi the Doer Real life destroyer....giggling while at it. skhakhane prepared the letter on his behalf. his was to sign. what's the point of this commission If ever there was a more credible witness! Where is the ‚ÄúCollective ‚Äú response of the ANC? Should be safe from looters üî•there in Addis 
1:56:29,2:04:46, zuma must go for lie detector. The lie detector will break down because of overloading. Singi he will have zero mark Is true Gee @Diwi The Boer üòéü§£ü§£ü§£ üòÇüòÇüòÇyou made my day@Diwi "This witness has already said he told Zuma ""if you want me to to resign you must pay me up till the end of my contract""" i am both@Gee Peex1 do you want to conduct inspection in loco? what relevance does this question has in relation to the proceedings we watching anyway?@Gee Peex1 
2:04:54,2:13:21, The money is already finished Constitutional courts findings was in correct decisions I'm smelling a rat here with this agent Nxasana ... üòÇüòÇüòÇ @Singi Mathebula I expected you to ask the question sooner rather than later. I found the question to be very disrespectful and inappropriate. Well done no witness they will get paid buy american tax payers lol you some times want to give an empty vessel to expose his/her stupidity@pastor j @Gee Peex1 You dont seem to have the ability to shut up for a few minutes to breathe. You are a very disrespectful and despicable person. Dont force people to communicate or respond to you. I will not Wrong JZ just has smart lawyers.. JZ is as stupid as a brick 
2:13:55,2:18:00, Yes The dumbest Judge Zondo very sharp üëç Gee Zondo got sharp minds but struggle to coordinates words to put matters into a clear and simple perspectives ; it take him long time to do so "Judges are not auctioneers they make decicions on people How did Zuma proved that Nxasana asked to be removed from office? Zondo has a voice like Barry White if he sang his words would be faster ü§£ "You are right Danie It's just that Zondo has a very deep voice. Nothing wrong with Zondo. 
2:18:08,2:24:15, @ Nelson Musoliwa DCJ is careful to comment on the findings but there loopholes in judgement so he will come back with findings on later stage agreed RZ is applying his mind very well for him not to be misinterpreted IGee i agree with you that is why i said linguistically; in shied to say to coordinate English words; Exactly how long was this witness head of NPD? @ Gee Peex1 yes for me that Judgement was not decided on bringing back coz he never vacate office by himself he was persuaded by the president to vacate office It sounds like this man was not employed for longer than 6 months My view is that justice Zondo is very careful when selecting the words to use as judge understands the meaning of words to some extent different from the ordinarily use of some of these words. He was trying to buy you sir 
2:26:54,2:29:36, "this whole country called South Africa must closed Taxpayers I think jz bought him (mn) Surely a contract of 10 years has other legal contractual terms referring to termination of employment. @Born free He held the position from October 2013 to May 2015 Zuma Attoneys and minister D. Mahlobo Hnery you r right Zondo is very careful and got sharp minds all i am saying is he struggle to coordinate English words to clear and simplify matters perspectively. that was a setup advocate. @Nelson Musoliwa what is the point you want to make if you have one 
2:30:12,2:36:54, What the point of having points there is no point int that point what so ever @Gee Peex1 kwaaks We will listen those telephone conversation right here see who lies Danie there can be a point till i make it clear and simple for you sharp and fast; not so? 43 million zar this year alone @Nelson Musoliwa a point is only vilid if both parties agree on the point does not matter if it is a slow agrrement or a fast agreement the point is both parties should agree on said point what will happen after all these coz they have already wasted more than 50m if I'm not mistaken... Commission will go to investigate those conversations recording and we will hear who lied here because DCJ is looking for facts 
2:38:10,2:44:35, Dani i think u got it wrong fact is not about agreement but proven truth. if al the captured moneys can be returned to state coffers south africa will be solvent again but as it stands now it will not happen and the commision can use some more millions Danie Nilsen what a circus "Eeeeh! Very clever Adv Nxasana "We not just satisfy by one individual who tell us stories and the clown are stil in the same jobs eating curry and all hey man not right man i want to sell some orange overalls man some nice big sizes and i will die a happy man Mabunda is witnes laywer i thought it was a TGIF day for her it happens 
2:44:59,2:51:17, @ Gee Peex1 ‚ÄãI was very disappointed with Advocate Kate Hofmeyr on Friday....what did she do? I think she was clear and articulate. yes she was but in a bit of a hurry remember it was friday lol @Gee Peex1 ‚Äã@Danie Nilsen : She is the evidence leader and I think she must seek clarity and understanding with the witnesses. @Phillip Cwazibe as she did hence bending over to the witness to make her self concise and clear "when he says ""quite"" important the judge means extremely important." @Danie Nilsen Agreed with that. ANC must stop defending individuals who are accused of corruption and leave there without investing this to protect integrity of the party look here Anc is absent here "WHEN will we an oversite comitee on captured comitee we never had over site under Zuma's administration. there were all captured. 
2:51:53,2:55:38, @makhosi nobhatyi if that happens there will be no ANC party left only lonley anc voters @ Singi Mathebula you correct "@Singi Mathebula True Law does not apply to everyone. Look Zuma's are still free. Here we go. We must amend the Constitution. Parliamentarians should be elected NOT nominated by the crooks who won the election. "they did nit ""resign"" they RAN FORREST RUN""" @ Danie Nilsen ‚Äã Over site committees should not be constituted on the basis of majority but equal representation of all political parties. I still believe there are those who still have consciousness to lead clean government but cowards to speak out coz they will subjected as if they embarrassed party @ Danie Nilsen @Gee Peex1 somehow to get a point trhough bending is allowed... i think 
2:55:46,3:01:52, I agree @Concerned South African "If we had low "@Phillip Cwazibe Traditionally "@ Anne M. ‚Äã@Phillip Cwazibe Traditionally @Gee Peex1 it should be aplied just before it can become as an sexual act or gesture depends on the gender of the witness True this wiitnes is an gelden handshake wannabe i am afraid my pity for him has now turned to some what negative golden sorry The Commission will recommend that he be compensated for losing his practice. I can see that coming from line of questioning from the Chair 
3:02:55,3:06:04, He did nothing wrong he was forced to leave because he was doing everything RIGHT. He was not corruptible a bit much of self pity flowing from him i say that as he is a legal person trained in lying for guilty persons for a fee DCJ have sympathy for this man He did not breach his contract it was Zuma and Jiba and Mrwebi @Gee Peex1 i fully agree on the supplelness very much so Justine of many caught as innocent victims of state capture i suspect zuma has influenced every one not to consult with his practise They must pay him back that R10 mil sorry state indeed. 
3:06:22,3:10:26, I hope he can show the same simpathy to all other people that were used and dumped...like Themba Maseko who paid him the 10 mill Iam glad he spent the money yes me too free advert for Adv Nxasana's practise @ Gee Peex1 it is sad poor man never wanted to vacate his office he was forced to do so "@Born free  @Phillip Cwazibe then i nthink zuma must pay bach THE MONEY we will consult with malema on that "zuma can use some of gadaffi 
3:11:37,3:19:57, @Gee Peex1 i undrstand that the court ruled that way but zuma said no they must split the diffrence lol what is mrNxasane doing here did he not get enough or does he want more he alredy captured 14mill how much more does he want 10 % spot on @Gee Peex1 have not met her gf maybe i should fall in line oh sorry GIRLFRIEND how obnoxious of me apolagies and sad to say i am 65 years with a puanch but do ha a nice ponytail lol whoooo big present and supper at the ceasers palace at least Hello sweetie pie 14 mill zar out of my legue lol

3:43:57,3:46:57, @Makwa Choma The gravy train has run out of gravy It means that there is no money Why the media did not help the public with explaining that statement??? That is why Zuma was always giggling @Makwa Choma Which statement? "Please leave ZUMA ALONE "witnesses Watson the president said in parliament that the country resources are depleted "unprepared prosecuter 
3:47:04,3:49:37, "Blame the ANC "Makwa "My problem is once you mention Zuma only Zuma took instructions from the Guptas "It is so said seeing foreign shops looting Report when they done wrong n "The ANC are guilty of doin nothing.
