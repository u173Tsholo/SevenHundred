"Dr Ben Ngubane 
1:09:26,1:12:28, Aloha friends 👋🤠 South Africa the country of hate Indeed @Yin Yang 🙏 @Yin Yang we are modern day slaves "It's now tea time Chairperson @Leeroy Lepere ..... and who is your master then? look at the facts theres a high unemployment rate in SA which affects black people however we still employ foreign nationals? @Robert Russell you are my master Leeroy Lepere and you better get your facts striaght i am not a thief 
1:12:54,1:15:54, @Peter Staffen your ancestors are @Leeroy Lepere....... if you want to think of that way then then that's up to you What do you all think of Michael Tellinger? Who is he? @Phillip Blair He is from the Ubuntu party. Never heard of him or the party Oh okay..... are we talking about the dude from Water Fall Boven? I'm in the United States. He's spoken about it here. Leeroy Lepere and that will be the start of civil war 
1:16:35,1:22:52, "@this is balls every country has immigrants like it or not Who is the Desmond Tutu of Today? Who is the Nelson Mandela of today? @Phillip Blair No name comes to mind and perhaps none will soon enough "This is ball That's too bad @This Is Balls @Pastor J 😞 They must be out there somewhere. 🙏🕊 "This is balls @Phillip Blair We will pray for another Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela to emerge and ensure this beautiful country rises again to the Glory and success it so richly deserves Yes indeed @Pastor J 🙂🙏 @Pastor J ......100%..... 
1:24:31,1:29:39, But I'm affriad that you are not going to find these leaders in the ANC.... they are too corrupted for the next 2 generations. @Pastor J @Dumisani Nxumalo Respectfully and sadly I cannot agree with you. @Robert Russell We should never encounter and experience the tragedy that the ANC delivered to destroy this country to what it is now. "Ngubane if morning live was so popular Is your avatar a picture of your dog @This Is Balls? I would not be surprised if all this violence and criminality is not brought about by the ACE/ZUMA faction to make SA ungovernable @Robert Russell This country does not need Politicians. We need a Management Council who comprise of Professional people who are tried and tested. Never a Politician...... Just in time for the real Hlaudi😝 Has that been done anywhere @Pastor J? 
1:30:22,1:34:11, sinned @Phillip Blair We once had a Presidents Council of about 20 professionals that supported the Mandela Presidency. That was possibly the best time economically post Apartheid. Interesting @redriger @Pastor J I didn't know about those. I was thinking of Venice for some reason. 🤔 "Listen guys When Guptas enter at SABC things start to be soar Perhaps Yes @Phillip Blair "The bible has the answer  "@Thando Nkutha Absolutely true. That is why the 1st question I ask someone who says please pray for me is ""did you pray for yourself""" @Hennie Vatso Amen to that 
1:34:27,1:36:04, 👍 Yes it is him @ Thando Nkutha "I know that Nelson Mandela studied Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius in depth @Phillip Blair Interesting perspective 😂🤣😂 people skill.....what> Financial skills nothing 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ as CEO you have got to be joking Meditations*

BEN-50 Dumisani can u reply Yin Jang Hlaudi had ppl skills are you hearing this people? Tell others spread the word 😃 
1:39:16,1:41:49, The problem is that some of y’all don’t listen. Ngubane just statesmen that Hlaudi came in 1995 SABC through a white man.. because of his creativity "I like the idea of giving Compassion Training to politicians. Sadhguru has been doing something like this @Cerebis Follow his career path and you will see the disaster he left in his path. This is a one man Tsunami "@Thando Nkutha i believe so too ... in India @Phillip Blair I watched many of those seminar videos and i still do. Very enlightening but our bunch of Politicians are a unique bunch. Beyond help sadly @Pastor J Thank you I will. I remember him from the IFP days. Ambassador in Japan? yes he was "Because I like the idea of Compassion Training and he's the only one in the world who's doing it with political leaders
