time,12:36,message Morning Goodmorning Advocate Minyoi.. you can proceed ready EFF Sound is bad Thanx SABC "Julius Malema got that no brainer Zuma elected in 2008. Malema is a partner of State Capture especially in Limpopo. Malema is being investigated for tender corruption 
13:47,22:26, Have you ever wondered how Malema made his millions.. just google it. @Val Speirs how did your forefathers made their millions which you and your generations will inherit? I am poor no millions not even my ancestors made money but they worked hard to out food on the table. I hope to win the lotto Malena is a partner in State Capture @Val Speirs you seem to have a problem with the CIC..why? "When Malema was expelled from the ANC in 2012 because he is an embarrassment to them Which race is synonymous with economic mismanagement? The Black race. Sorry but true 
23:57,26:07, why does this have to be about race? a cheat is a cheat is a cheat regardless of the colour of the skin. why make it a Malema also hashed up false stories in order to get Pravin Gordhan axed. Malena is worse than Zuma. No sound at all!!! Apologies But I did not ask the question about race. @Magda Seguin Sound is fine this side. Maybe reload your streaming? @Karen Hewson and @Michael Wild ask @Val Speirs why ask dumb questions like that. individuals make the choice to do wrong. Not so Felix 
26:09,33:12, and they come from all walks of life. "No it's not @Val Speirs get the latest copy of #Noseweek. The publication wrote an article on the rogue unit and Mr. Joshua Doorre Exactly. They could not corrupt Booysen because he is not that kind of of man. Thank you SABC! Is Joshua Doore still around?? A person is either corrupt or not. Booysen is NOT. "@Thando what goes around comes around . when u pray for rain  so much money wasted to protect the corrupt 
34:12,40:54, Which continent is synonymous with economic mismanagement which inevitably results in under development? "@Thando Nkutha Your advice is too late for Jiba You can't make this stuff up!!! "Hopefully the cases of corruption against Zuma Africa @Louis Opperman True. @Val Speirs yes Joshua Doore is around he was a pharmacist now a 'world renown' spineless askari Flying them down from joburg to pretoria? To Durban 
42:48,48:56, Yes Judge...subpoenas people from PTA and JHB to Dur Were they all so blind with power and greed thinking this rot things will never come out? They though they were above the law I wonder if they still feel that way? haha I think their world of greed and corruption is crashing down on them as we speak. Work a man on his mind(indoctrination) then you will control him for a long time than enticing him with material things which may be lacking at times. Yes Nelson that is Malemas agenda with the poor and unemployed. "Remember Zuma was intelligence head in exile 
49:30,57:52, vert true. Agree with you Val it is not coincidence let the poor be warned against this type of leaders he also ordered the killing of ANC members that started an uprising in Mozambique. what a great leader. Political killings in SA is not widely reported and it goes on unabated It is easy to understand why Malema said he will kill for Zuma "Why do you think Malema said ""I will kill to put Zuma in power""?because Zuma is not an intelligent man and was corruptable and of course Malema had an Agenda." Zuma had so much more that he exonerated Jiba's husband and employed her a DD of the NPA knowing full well she was never admitted to the Bar as an attorney I can full well understand that CR was not included in the Zuma faction while he was deputy president...everything happened underground Power next to the state coffers(money) is not as healthy as we would like it to be. Is this without regard to race? 
58:27,1:04:29, Hi Nelson the poor people are not going to listen to my warnings but they may listen to yours. Malemas agenda is not only to capture all government entities but to capture private business entities and loot the lot. @seguin that will make sense to Maimane Val you cant loose before you fight but your point is understood . You have a role to play in awakening the poor on this matter malema once collapsed limpopo . we didn't forget that f OK Nelson I will try my best. Can you help please? "@Magda Seguin you know when people donâ€™t want you to know coz you may expose them they hide everything until people who work for them tired and speak out Of course Val 
1:04:56,1:10:59, They were scared . I can understand why they were scared to come forward while Zuma was President. ATC submission to have ATM struck off the ballot paper has nullified by IEC. Vote #ATM whoop whoop @makhosi nobhatyi true "We have seen these people are willing to work with the state to help the country and anc come clean from corruption And flying down on New Years day!! "ATM is corrupting our people Precisely Service delivery must get to the people but this has not happened because of corruption. The municipalities are just as corrupt. It's the same as the fake pastors @makhosi nobhatyi they enslave people psychologically Wonder if those Advocates are going to be Advocates for very much longer? 
1:11:18,1:13:33, ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ he wanted to take our booze They must be suspended by the close of this testimony. @Val speirs yesterday I was listening to the president when he delivered maiden speech on the endorsement of election saying time to play is finished no excuse service must go to the people Can someone tel me what are we owing this guptas that makes them to take advantage of everything that we own. Many advocates are going to be struck off the advocates roll after this I hope the President is sincere. The Guptas was first introduced to Zuma by Essop Pahad in India that's where it all started We all hope so Val. 
1:13:37,1:19:18, ANC gov hav ba "china is here "@Val speirs me too The Guptas are Zuma comrades. A Gupta helped Zumas son many years ago so when Zuma came into power.. thanks to Julius.. Zuma allowed his anti-apartheid comrades to capture the state. "South Africa should never have joined BRICS *oppressive I think we need to fix our national security we not safe in this country "They are fighting a humble person like Ramaphosa for wat he believes law should apply to any one who did wrong including him Yes National Security needs attention. 
1:19:43,1:23:46, "@manzi Booysen memory is out of this world names places etc I wonder why these crooked prosecutors and policemen and women are still in state employment shocking He was making notes!!! so tell me also need compulsory military training for 2 yrs. us this time to teach hands on trades as well. also gives employment for short time. Advice:Keep a diary...I do and save them for all my life OUr national security was at a very high rist It is broken Nelson. we are listening to some very intelligent people. they see the bigger picture . 
1:23:51,1:37:33, CP was with Zuma as deputy for how many years.....and did nothing. Whats changed since he came in......nothing.... While the security services was working for Zuma other countries may have all SA secret info...they created a gap for others to spy on SA We back thx for updates. PleasureðŸ˜‚ "Why does the SABCNEWS battle so much with their sound? This is getting annoying. Today is press freedom day and we want to hear this news they thought they would get away with all if thisðŸ¤” @Granny Mokwena And they did - for quite a few years. Hello to all my BANTU

"as an afrikaner ""boer"" i agree that we have a new flag and as such should respect it @Danie Nilsen I agree with you - any hate speech is unacceptable. "@psyfrequency Techno forget about that flag must remove the union jack 
1:46:54,1:49:23, I find it hard to believe that Ramophosa did not know that State Capture was going on at least since 2009. OK you have my vote. Are you registered? Mbalula did well by letting general Ntlemeza go ðŸ¤£ @Val Speirs yes we are "@Val Speirs you need to accept that government institutions was used to fight political battles The FREE transvaal Party @psyfrequency Techno how about DA? "the old flag represented progress. Many people are jealous because under the current flag

They don't seem to realise there's no connection ðŸ™„ This caucasian Johan Boosen is like the kid in the playground who accuses everyone "the calibre of policemen brought to us by the comrades @Felix Muyoba is an honorary caucasian "Thank you @Michael Holmes Duduzane Zuma... @Michael Holmes Don't forget that Khayamandi is in the Western Cape 
1:55:07,1:57:16, State capture nearly destroyed T Madonsela's career if not life Not only taxpayers money but pension fund money. @Fils de l'homme no man..for me if you are a principled person i dont care whether black or white i will support you.. What people font understand us that the DA get their share of money from treasury like all the other provinces but dont steal or mismanage it @Felix Muyoba that is why u r an honorary caucasian Booysen is the only honourable man testifying. the general is a principled man i can sense..so i support him but the transvaal story.. @Filâ€™s de Iâ€™homme it is better but need to improve their service delivery and fix the tender entrepreneurial system which is corrupting our politicians "@psyfrequency Techno 
1:57:52,2:00:03, who makes up the majority of tax paying public? daar gaan nog groot knaters val en n paar onoembare tannie goete "@makhosi nobhatyi if u r judging the DA bcz of the toilet thatn u hav not travelled to the eastern cape South Africans didnt want to believe that Zuma comsorted with gangsters "@psyfrequency Techno what does their ""own kind"" mean to you?" Yes and they suspend all these government crooks with full pay for years because they have no money in their pension funds to pay them out with. Then they steal from other coffers to do so. They are back but we aren't nothing on ENCA Tea no Curry this time...

"ANC manifesto is clear and is party for all The Guptas captured Zuma son. "Booysen describes an ""unholy alliance"" between Richard Mdluli and Ntlemeza to get rid of Dramat" booysen's meetings with Duduzane don't add up. What was being discussed? "At Saxonville

Gen Booysen obviously didn't know the Zuma/Zuma connection...All the people who met the Guptas was through Duduzanes who brings in the Guptas by surprise It was a deliberate pattern to implicate key people the guptas didnt become family friends of the whole government over night of you were meeting them something shifty was going down gaurenteed 
2:18:56,2:19:37, "So Duduzane was his ""dad's middle man: because he is ""likable""" i own computer sale shops and all that goes with it and buy from Sahare shop in gauteng does it makes me corrupt future medics Nhlanhla Nene met them but he got an axe @Magda Seguin you are wrong.
