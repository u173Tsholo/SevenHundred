Ms Molefe you beaut @Madelein Huxtable maybe he should also come to the inquiry as well @carnoth ngomane He has a temper and it would be nice to see GW loosing it on the stand 
7:28,9:34, Dumelaaaaaaang 😃 "Ramaphosa Junior teminated 2 million deal with Bosasa which was signed by 2017 his company to be consultant Venter must not take changes. Why does he want to make changes? *chances "@Madelein Huxtable you are correct Makhosi. is that really true. Wrong time for amendment Mr. Chair. Plz stop protecting liar Andile Ramaphosa wants to join EFF. The guy is trying his luck now

Ke mathata fela. @Musa Bakiti Agrizi protected many people and will pay for that Delay tactics his lawyer warned him what he says yesterday that Agrizzi said all about Bosasa as him seemed not to corporate hiding information on his chest he would struggle to answer crossexamined 
45:49,48:06, He suddenly couldn't see the exit. Maybe Zondo wants to see how deep Venter wants to alter his statement... DCJ Zondo is giving Venter a long rope. Cameron. you are not answering my questions. but said we only know 10% of what's going on. "@Tommy Mty yes Zondo is very smart and Venter will be caught napping Venter knows more than Agrizi @carnoth ngomane Certainly Headline: South African parties to support land ensue and not DA as it is focusing on better life for all moving forward 
48:26,50:18, Cameron. That we know. he handles the monies. DCJ Zondo is tired with Pritoruis always around beautiful chicks Zondo is married. @Yin Yang. Read what Yin? Zondo is the Og.

Yes @Frik Brits they will starve if we dont help them @Derek Main you will be a slave just like with the ANC and EFF I wonder why Fils and the guy from yesterday with the EFF pic are never online at the same time. Im sure it would be quite entertaining to see them go head to head. Perhaps they are the same person? is this the same guy who claimed yesterday that he wasn't involved in anything illegal at Bosasa? Mehlolo lawd🤔🤔 "I will vote for I - Cossa it will save the people off poverty @Cameron Kim True why not in court "@Cameron Kim ""NEVER TRUST A COMMISION"" ?? Odd comment."
