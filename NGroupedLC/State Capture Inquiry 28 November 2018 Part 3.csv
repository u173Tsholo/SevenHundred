time,17:25,message This evidence leader is so cute Zuma is going down TOOO CUTE whar this is zuma day whats her name tooo cute It must be nice being this guy...appointed to such a high position with ZERO TO NONE EXPERIENCE 
17:42,21:34, it's crazy head of NPA Without practicing as an attorney Okay this lady is so BAE we were busy thinking everything is in order under Pres zuma leadership.. the Zuptas must have thought he will be easily corrupted Zuma and His friends were always looking for someone who was going to be their gateway to everything... the meeting its bad because this was pure manipulation of innocent people who wanted to serve the country "It is so sad 
22:30,29:37, the whole AnC leadership is corrupt No experience but people are advising government separtments and visitors hmm the commission are getting a lot of info on a corrupt ANC and Zumanites and this with a national election 6/7 months away Black race we should agree that we are all weak to say no to corruption. "ANC is corrupt "in Dec the commission takes a break @Luckey Binali what did u say i think the best will be a coalition gov next year @Luckey Binali prove the eff is racist 
29:42,42:22, @dave exactly that how is the eff violent I don't have to prove to anybody violent in what way. speaking for the poor black majority is right. we have been displaced and are politically fighting to making things right SA is ungovernable and will always be. nxt year make sure u vote fo me @dave I've just said my reasons why I won't vote I'd rather go watch bafana lose than going to the polls I'm sure u got ur reasons why you will vote "yr vote is yr voice none of the parties make sense for me to vote for them 
43:19,59:20, so u trying to say u lost hope? so voting so black people can control their own future isnt worth voting 4 voting so we can control and have institutions built and governed by our children is worth 1 minute ticketing a box exactly ANC will rule forever as long as we still have paranoid or gullible people who vote eff they want land and control to nationalize institutions so the prople benefit from the resources @Luckey Binali Agree fully. Only reason to vote for the DA is the chances of getting service delivery is better ðŸ˜ƒ ANC is no longer the same. @Khothatso Khiba ANC is not for black people. they have had 25 years and we south africans are poor while white and indians are rich of our land and resources your vote is your voice is the crap that politicians use to control pple but once u vote them in they don't recognise your voice nomore. so why would I waste my time and energy voting 
1:02:30,1:10:43, Should one not think more pragmatically @Luckey Binali? Only reason I would vote for the DA is not because of their policies and values bla-bla but chances potholes will be fixed etc. "EFF for africans  What is Manyi going to say now My vote will go to EFF for a change he can't BS anymore Julius malema excites violence I can see Jimmy pooping in his pants next time we see him here @Andre Gerberâ€‹ @Ewald Kruger he will ask all evidence leaders not to cross examine him @The Explore Store violence ke mmago..where did you see EFF doing violent conduct? 
1:11:43,1:17:50, ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ he will pitch with his own @Andre Gerber It seems like all departments need to be evaluated an see whether those who holds those high positions are qualified I guess majority of them are not qualified for those positions corruption broke South Africa. "@Ewald Kruger he did not have counsel the other day Commission is going to give him counsel SAA comes to mind He asked Maleka? ðŸ˜€ @Andre Gerber yes Maleka told the commission the day he wanted Maleka recused 
1:18:38,1:23:22, ðŸ˜€ can't stop laughing @Andre Gerber wats up suckers thatis one of the reasons he accepted Maleka after the break you can watch on Manyi's 2nd day what causes eyes to look in 2 different directions? "yeah maleka was trying to explain that he has no issues against Manyi as he suggested "Will have a look "fmr president Zuma is so astute. he never told people why he fired them. they are just guessing thats the reason I said he was ignoring Maleka on the 1st day
