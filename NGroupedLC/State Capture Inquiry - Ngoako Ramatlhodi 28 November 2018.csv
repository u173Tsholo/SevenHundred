Yah he is nailing him... i am raising this because i did not observe these comments when maleka and the other male advocates lead. it just not on. zuma didnt attended gupta wedding we had no complaints sindi Gedleyihlekisa was Guptas puppet His Imppression? 
52:58,55:39, When Zuma goes down a lot of prominent figures in politics are also going down. If they don't protect him they are going down SHOW OFF! ahwa...DCJ must allow my sister to work here "JZ is a great politician i wonder if Zuma and cronies ever think of whacking each and every one of the witnesses It was clear that the Guptas were leading this country. JZ was only their proxy. the guptas took an advantage of our president. honestly!! kulungile mfanakiti The evidence leader is nervous 
56:50,58:19, @Singi Mathebula . the question because why were they taking advantage. what is it that gives them that hold over him and the witness knows what he is talking about. leave the evidence leader alone. @Singi Mathebula You Cannot Buy What Is Not For Sale The look on DCJ when it was mentioned that the Business indaba will be held at Gupta home.

""" my people perish because of lavk of knowlege"" so say the Lord. thus is the only reason why the guptas took charge ." he's brave

UNFORTUNATELY! Dololo @sakhile mtshali who is that fondling a journalist? KEEP IT UP RAMA i can call you KING RAMA 
1:34:23,1:36:29, This RAMA is very TASTY Ngoako Ramatlhodi implicating more government officials without proof. A legendary sensationalist 😂😂 "all he must avoid is use words like "Rama is saying exactly what the people wants to hear Zuma authorised the landing of Guptas according to Ramatlhodi. He heard this but doesn't have proof of this approval from Zuma.It's another proof less & hearsay day. Absolutely @peter pott Rama is on fire they even forgot to take short break @ 11:15 😀 no one in his right mind will blatantly lie like that...REALLY now @Trucker​Ngoako Ramatlhodi implicating more government officials without proof Commander was Dr Wale Serote the translater wrote Wireless Router📲😱 
1:36:31,1:39:02, "Kahle kahle or one needs to assist the commission by bring something the Commission can corroborate and confirm or otherwise with the implicated persons? No one was ever given reasons for his/her removal The guptas also forcefully removed Ngoako's front teeth while he was sleeping. Today i'm just hear to comment and keep it moving. Not entertaining any responses to what I am saying. not here to debate. If you looking to debate you're out of luck. TSEK! I'm sure Zondo is in hurry☕☕ wanting to come back for more from Rama Unfortunately his diaries are still kept by his former PA @Mpondzwana😂 Implicated people are informed and welcome to come to the commission and tell their version @Mpondzwana @Londani Rodney yoooo im sure he wants to die

As you pointed out that Zulus ""kill our African brothers and sisters"" @Buyiswa Mnyani i'm Rama is laughing now saying i will show e'm flames😂😀 "@thembeka shibe "@human @Yose Human yep the challenge with this commission is that it's gonna backfire on luthuli house face. because every cadre coming here hasn't stopped blaming another "I'm a proud Zulu BUT I refuse to be crucified for other peoples wrong doings!!! so leave the Zulus out of this 
1:45:50,1:49:05, Take us back Zondo we are yours!!! Let go back😂 We are back Advocate Ramatlhodi. Let's go. Even Zondo is really interested in what this witness has to say. sebefikile not much progress to come from this ... back Whose he? is he reffering to Zuma? "but he is a democrat

The Guptas were powerful in the Cabinet Absolutely @Andre Gerber @Dumisani Nqetho that Yes Yes HMM HMM is very important now we are "😂😂😂 ""This Animal""" but anc are doing the same with current president. no one blaspheme him for taking mmoney 
2:00:01,2:00:48, The essence of Zondos question is what did you guys do?? who allowed gutpas to be powerful.....zuma thank you judge Zuma era may only be characterized by saying it was a Crime of Power by zuma and his stooges in the ANC "zuma They were powerful in the Cabinet through their proxy...JZ @Thanyani Nthangeni What happened to the evidence leader? Who said something about the Guptas and Ngoako's front teeth?😂 "Thank you Zondo.. I understood clearly 
2:00:49,2:01:41, @pott..1 fool at a time😂 """We have lost our tongues"" Wow...." zuma was corrupt to the core Network is bad yazi dem thing buffers!!! This is very sad. poor people's votes are being played with "yes can't wait for the implicated persons to react on this witness "As i said "my question exactly ZONDO 
2:01:50,2:02:57, there is no need for evidence leader Rama is flowing 😀 👍 @Andre Gerber​ can't wait for the implicated persons to react on this witness Da was fighting against zuma for years but this leader is saying the NEC of the ANC had no say in president Zumas term. hayibo that not true me too @Ewald Kruger ANC clearly does not have the people at heart. They only care about themselves in power... sies! disgusting leadership with no backbone controlled by one family sies! judge Zondo ask relevant questions I think he will be hostile @Ewald Kruger. Lol in essence the ANC is on trial 
2:02:59,2:04:07, Zuma paralysed the NEC????Yerrrrr! Thing is his answer will try to avoid their implication as a collective Reinstate SARS like it was! Stop wasting our money (we all work and pay tax) The government takes our money and feed their families and build their homes. They dont look after us with our tax we pay! The NEC has 80 members...EIGHTY...and they couldn't do anything?? "@dlamini zuma killed nec What did you guys do?? simple question...answer baba @Soney Ehlers 💯😩 "imagine what we have been through in the past 
2:04:10,2:04:50, That NEC was factionalized "Indeed This guy is giving raw evidence "@khumalo "Probe Zondo JZ planted his cheerleaders and supporters in that NEC @Ewald Kruger. more than 60% of the NEC was benefitting from that relationship. "Over 80 people were scared of 1 person SABC carema was captured here in the state capture inquiry whilst capturing zuma faction is dangerous 
2:04:56,2:05:40, "i wonder what Zizi Kodwa will say after all the prevous witness and Rama testifying now THE SLAT LEADERSHIP IS WHAT CAUSE THE NEC OF ANC TO BE PARALISED peter pott he is cornered!!! Because he was part of a faction also are we saying too that pres cyril was also paralyzed since he was also second in charge of the NEC "@Sne Mdletye 😂😂 I can feel your anger through my phone😂 Kodwa ke image EFF with 25 seat in parliament has done so much against 400 seat of ANC. Bloody shocking @Sindiswa Moolman​ JZ planted his cheerleaders and supporters in that NEC the whole electorate must change. leader is the face organisation if you disagree with the leader your in Trouble of Lossing JOB in that instances

THE MAJORITY OF ZUMA THE NEC WHERE HAVING SMALLNYANA SKELETON it's lunchtime and need a bottle of Chivas to finish this day as the witness goes on Gordon was ready to fight Tyhini bantu!! @Sindiswa Moolman​I can go and do an in-depth analysis of the former members Ngoako is lying... My point exactly @Michael Zulu todays its state of the ANCNEC inquiry..how they should vote and all that.. 
2:09:19,2:10:23, Really @Keatlaretse Phetwe Substantiate your argument that he is lying @Keatlaretse Phetwe @phetwe lying? "Gordhan said What an insult that zuma has done to the country the guy has sold out the country....the guy is nothing under the sun. they vote at NEC.... @Keatlaretse Phetwe kindly substantiate... The lady must just sit down and let DCJ lead They don't vote @Keatlaretse Phetwe 
2:10:42,2:11:34, @Keatlaretse Phetwe are you CAPTURED? "So vele since y'all see how corrupt government officials are mOTION OF NO CONFIDENCE WAS VOTED AGAINST... Gordon is the last hope for sa In ANC during zuma it was you either toe the line or shape out such crimes should be punishable by death... It’s sad that these freedom fighters who were humiliated by the Apartheid Government were scared of Zuma the ANC must discipline everybody who was involve during the Gupta SAGA and to think we as taxpayers are still paying Zuma's salary to the tune of millions 
2:11:46,2:12:30, can Zondo ask Rama if the then deputy president of the ANC also didn't have courage nor power to stop the president? Zuma’s time will come. @Hester Ferrezuelo 😢 @MornaLisa M. EEF Is the only way out of this mess. Prison In parliament not in the nec @Keatlaretse Phetwe "If you know Gordon his fighting No in ANC. Motion was moved twice by Hanekom.. 
2:12:34,2:13:12, Zondo is now running around the circle on one matter for far too long @Duze Mthimunye How does a DP stop a president who has numbers on this side? Yessssss!!!!!!! Aikhona Tata! "NEC @Thanyani Nthangeni who is the EEF? @Thanyani Nthangeni the problem with the EFF is how they go about things😣 Thats the only reasonable answer to that Q The whole ANC is messed up simple they couldn't act earlier because they were paralysed by smallernyana skeletons already . say it Rama 
2:13:13,2:13:46, people need to know that SA now is in crisis due to negligent of minority. who wants to enrich themselves what in the world are you then doing advising pres CR when you are paralyzed? we need gordon yo Zondo is getting fed up Ngoako is staggering... jonas @Keatlaretse Phetwe the nec does not vote on anything. They rely on consensus to make decision The counsel has been reduced to passenger now they couldnt act earlier cause they feared being victimised 
2:13:52,2:14:29, @Thanyani Nthangeni or are you talking about the Gucci comrades? "save us Democratic Alliance and Mmusi Maimane from the scourge the cANCer has subjected us to. 2019 Go DEEPER Papa Zondo 😀 "Zondo loves gossip @Pat Silangwe What do u mean by the minority wanting to enrich themselves? Is the ANC the minority? In Afican culture is not allowed to speak with food in your mouth. "he came here as a hero Ngoako was singing all along but when the questions are turned back at them.. they want to act as saints.
