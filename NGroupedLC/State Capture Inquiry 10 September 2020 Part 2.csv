24:30,28:16, You have to wonder how many hours have been put into finding transcripts in this commission... I hate this council... been falling asleep 4 times now 😳😳😳 What this commission needs is hecklers like people in this chat to be there and throw in our two cents every now and then... these witnesses will remember things properly that way lol Hi Guys Hi cousin... "melor hadebe he is soft spoken but very aggressive Lol a b c you're right 😅 abc Agree lots of fun 
28:44,32:40, ay kushubile @Monokeng he reads more than asking questions @abc LOL Cuz she is trying to sink mr tsoti This woman is wasting our time now leave the chat makhosi Shoo this woman is extremely long winded! Not sure of her guilt or innocence.... But to me such behaviour constitutes a lot of shadiness. "Melor Hadabe If mr Tsotsi was guilty of any wrongdoing was not going to mention Guptas and Zuma knowing he is working with them 
33:47,40:44, mhmmm @Supreme Monakeng Gerry Nel won as witnessed by conviction & sentence :thanksdoc::thanksdoc: "mangalani he didn't win @Nxolo Gumede my feeling exactly @Supreme Monokeng Who decides on stronger points? Your opinion or courts? Mr Makhosi.so you mean Mr Tsotsi he is innocent he never get share on the money have been stolen with these Crooks? he just helped them to do what ever they wanted to do. "What transpired did happen on its own @Melor Hadebe Thank you for clearing for him. Poor Judge Masepa was not aware of Dolos Entualis principle of law. I was embarrassed by her understanding. 
41:50,43:40, "Hadebe there wasn't an error who's this lady? I mean before today he denied killing Reeva he said hes gun killed her Her looking up and childishly rolling eyes is chowing my data please give reasons for supporting suspensions old lady @Supreme Monokeng Pls go read on Dolos Eventualis it stil cant "she was aware even more than then 
44:26,47:10, Eish this lady is lying. Patriotism. Last refuge of the scoundrel. Useless people on boards of SOEs. "When DCJ Zondo says ""Thats quiet interesting"" 😂😂😂🤣" After moving them aside........ did you get a clear picture of why the company is not performing 😕😕 It was not about what they were doing wrong.. it was that they were not doing anything She is a sweet talker and she easily diverts... "when Zondo says "" yes yes yes "" is like those old Anties wanting you to tell them more kkk" "@Mangalani not withstanding judge Masepas possible misinterpretation of dolus eventualis with this auntie on the board no wonder Eskom is in this state !! 
47:13,48:18, what was her position at Eskom "mangelani @Thulie ABSOLUTELY ye ye Whatttt.... give us reasons why we should not suspend you. But you did nothing wrong.... lol ooopssss! "@jonasnobrother thank you why ask for reasons when people have done NOTHING WRONG 
48:27,49:30, Those eyes are tsotsish @JONASNOBROTHER You premeditated murder & Dolus Eventualis are 2 different aspects! no you are not lost man what REASONS great work from the team leader🙌🙌🙌 the reason: to make space for haha because the chair said So lol "hiding doesn't prove its premeditated Mangalani thanks for finally getting the spelling right 
49:46,51:47, auntie must answer for herself "Mangelani @Vanessa Van Vuuren When do I get the price?😂😂😂 What Baba says is correct wrong or write 🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇 Youtube teachers And they were not able to defend the decision they took "Apologies I havnt said Hallo to the liars & thieves watching at Lootfreely House- I gather you havnt got money for staff salaries this month mhhhhhhh 
52:13,53:54, Auntie must retire fil for her. shes runing away now Auntie is supporting everything @Supreme You don’t seem to understand how our legal system & sentencing work. SCA correctly indicated that Judge Masepa got it WRONG! Now you want to use some logic. We only have one legal system whai a ju geh In the spirit of Ubuntu why cant she be allowed to go and rest? She has been tortured enough for the day @Supreme Strength of argument is judged by courts and not hearsay or personal bias. I want to break Free I want to break Free 
54:00,54:55, @Mangalani they're definitely 2 very different concepts. let me rephrase for u. Even if we accept there was incorrect application of dolus eventualis by the judge Business Tech says we shall be a failed state by 2030 along with Zim - if these are the idiots we employ in SOE's I doubt we will have to wait that long can innocent employee suspended for doing gd job.only at Eskom. how can you ask them why they should not be suspended where's you fully know that they did nothing wrong ...mara the guptas cronies is clear he didnt share the same view with baba to me she looks like an alcoholic. I'm sorry to say that the state did poorly to prove beyond reasonable doubt @Fireman umlilo abakhulume labantu akangaphumuli "@mangalani 
54:57,56:42, if the judge wants to havecansweres he will continue until his satisfied in the results no counsela "there's an old saying  @Danile Ngubenyathi I too suspect and I wonder if that cup she kept lifting didn't have a shot of spirits added 😂🤣😅🤦🏾‍♂️😅 the state failed because the perpetrator was still alife and she was no longer "Hi guys😅 l just joined the session and things are tense yyyyuuuu?? Uhlakaniphele enceleni loAuntie .. 😆😆 I agree with you i supported the suspension but the Gupta brothers forget to give reasons 
56:54,58:14, The DCJ is very persuasive and has a way of extracting the truth... board JONASNOBROTHER State was fantastic. Hence they even forced Oscar (despite protests from Barry) to go mental hospital for a month. "​Hi guys😅 l just joined the session and things are tense I can imagine how irritated the judge and leader must be with this. its going in circles. she is either not too bright or she is nervous and talking about everything else. The reason is known by Mbai & Nkandla laying thats all.u miss nothing bra @Samm Lindy Tshuma mamuhle ntokazi The leader is getting headaches from all these lies.😄 
58:22,59:23, Where they aware what the Investigation was about!!!? yes chair yes yes yes @Thubelihle Titus 😁 u baba and the guptas they didn't give them reasons that's why she is fumbling Eskom board meetings and no members and strange tenders and Japan decision waz taken. @Abel she was found playing without clothes on You can run but you cannot hide.😃
