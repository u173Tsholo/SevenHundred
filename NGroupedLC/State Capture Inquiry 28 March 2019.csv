Musi Maimane must of had a nice cold whisky last night after Rhamaphosa Jnr admitted to Bosasa payments. His wife knew all along he was involved in corruption and was enjoying the benefits. so she too must be locked by not telling the cops. The threat letter is written in Zulu.

You are reading my mind man. I just thought so Michael. @peter pott I'm a little worried with the input he had in Venter's affidavit as if to make sure that the other witnesses statements correspond with his...... @Mandla Dludlu we love his courage and willing to help this commission to be successful without his corporation we won’t know how damaging state capture is. He put his family in danger as you heard 
24:13,24:51, @Fils can you give an example in that regard "if they arrest Agrizzi we will protest he has lucifer on him. not Jesus. @Fils de l'homme Am in Durban why I must vote your side calm Bro Am not for Transvaal sorry @Nelson Musoliwa look at the crime in the country @Musa Bakiti ...thou shall not take thy Lord's name in vain the ANC is still going to rule us this people are corrupt its not even funny. they will use their corruption to win elections Hey we close to 3000 view today interesting neh Desmond it is true 
25:03,25:57, "@Michael @Talent P Sibisi the TRANSVAAL will be the paradise in AFRICA @makhosi nobhatyi I agree however his motive goes deeper than that especially when Venter spoke about his influence on Venter's affidavit..... "For sure Oswell We want more names. @jeevan singh ....exactly I get so irritated when I read Fils de homme's name here. All of Bosasa data was hacked by MI6 since 2000 "Hate him 
26:00,26:39, @Fils de l'homme I don't care about Africa I do care about South Africa We are above that 3000 Desmond. just ignore him. @Talent P Sibisi there we have something in comon Bosasa and Guptas were sharing wealth of this country actually so far he is the only witness who is willing to tell the story as is.not like Venter. "The biggest online viewership on SABC This man's answers are so precise "@Talent P Sibisi YES  
26:54,28:10, @Ills lot of circumstances led to such behavior example of which is the dehumanizing conditions they were subjected to by apartheid system. 2 million!!!? Cameron. Ask Trump. @Fils de l'homme enjoy the State Capture and @Cameron Kim am on your side. @jeevan singh. I've blocked this guy long ago. but ppl keep on commenting the I end up reading his name. @ marvel has that ever happened @Michael Michael I do not think that is the case. It is a personality issue & also depends on how deep they were into corruption. From the testimonies Agrizzi was just as deeply in it as Watson was. Government officials are not gd at all. @Yandi Masina are thinking how mush maybe kwaaaaa 
28:23,29:21, "Agrizzi is greasy with secrets Agrizzi how much were the bonuses? "Commsion will take 2 years @Yin Yang Big Check Angelo! I never received my cut of cake. Cash bonus and no tax "As Agrizzi said he took decision voluntarily to come out clean about all wrongdoing which himself was involved in @Christopher Pitt only JUNIOR people will be prosecuted @pitt you've got a point lol

Then Aggrizzi should not be arrested. @carnoth ngomane he denied that his son has received millions from Bosasa but yesterday there was a prove and he never said anything now heard Dudu Myeni and gang still nominated as parliament representatives by the ANC despite being implicated with Bosasa corruption. Bosasa had EVERY government contract mos. so these guys are the one's that broke into the post office @kim do you think South Africa will lead by Malema or Maimane?
