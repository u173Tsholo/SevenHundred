time,25:15,message This man must honestly be reigned in...He must adhere to the question-answer code of the commission Zondo is putting a question to him now A very long question "Yes lecture of note "I have seen witnesses that avoid answering questions. Now we have a guy whom obviously has nothing to hide No sooner he's invited to discuss he then crumbles under party peer pressure. I'm listening to the witness on the stand. he is lecturing us not testifying. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜„ 
27:50,43:00, @Mj I agreed with you this is a lecture i see no one this guy is talking to who where is evident leader I love this guys hair style "government is wasting money answer the question man flip how long will this commission last and no arrest made wasting money and time is mr carrim the guest speaker here. he is doing most of the talking without being led What is this guy giving evidence about? It seems like a boring lecture? Carrim needs to answer about the upgrades and CCTV installations at his house by Bossasa's Agrizzi 
44:05,55:44, He knows his work and explain clearly it seems he is a liberty to workshop this commission as he is speaking for hours on end. i blame the evidence leader. u cant give a witness leeway to taaaaaalk and taaaaalk and equivocated Peer Venter ...cctv installlations at carrims home ~ do you have evidence ......? Arrests are emminent First all these thugs need to be stripped off their Powers (Clipped off their Wings)before taking them to Prison.Dudu Myeni is one Example. He covers the questions that Zondo needs answered as Zondo said earlier. Also...give him enough rope and he may hang himself. His willingness to talk so much will get him into trouble jacon ''butternut'' zuma was captured by WMC as well. what a historical mistake please send I used to think this commission is worth every penny now I joint those saying it was and still a waste of state funds 
55:55,1:01:26, Did this one said society that is none racial? thieves. WHO are running SA by the way? commission has been granted extension until next year March no more extensions My humble apologies. It was Vincent Smith who benefited from Bossasa. I misplaced the two. Thank you Sir ~ appreciate your retraction. the extension will take the bill to a billion namasent I like this guy. expensive for nothing not a single soul arrested "Am just tired of hearing this name Gupta's. @ Mr Mpho: you cannot arrest anyone If the commission is in progress 
1:03:28,1:26:54, Very lively and energetic. He's clued up because he's an extensive reader. I've always admired his chairing of the Finance Committee in Parliament. Holds ministers accountable all the time. @Immanuel ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ he speaks proper english. i said it before to my friends multi choice is over charging us if digress was a personðŸ˜ƒ Legae Nyalungu ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ "@nkanyezi i will ask him to pay a handsome lobola to me first before i can hook you up What is his name by the way? yunus carrim He is so intelligent .
