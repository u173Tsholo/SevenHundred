9:45,12:14, chair is slowly today strong man n courageous is Mr Maseko @Abdul ..i wish people were saying the same thing about Mentor Ronweni mbhele Lucky for the country numerous government officials will face criminal and civil charges for their actions and to recover the stolen tax payers money before Inquiry is completed. Will Zuma come to testify? Will Gigaba come to testify? "If subpoenaed  yes he will 
13:18,16:47, I think it was mentioned that Gigaba and Pravina will appear here either later today or tomorrow @siphiwe mathibela I'm not sure Guys cant wait for Gigaba Why did the president agreed to this inquiry... waiting to see Gigamba😁😁😁😁 Is he testifying today?? Gigaba I mean??? "your president is implicated mos  Mhmmm Gordhan that father is so brilliant Nomthandazo Ndlovu​cant wait for Gigaba yea... 
16:51,20:23, 😂😂😂 lol yes I want to hear what he has to say I think this inquiry will course peoples lives? What do you think @siphiwe mathibela The inquiry is based on the recommendations from the PP which are enforceable. The President had no option grigamba is coming too???? is mr Melusi also featuring here? I'm from KZN and I am a Zulu it's not nice to hear people mocking Mr Zuma about his heard. where its cigaba born we mocking his head not Zulu 
20:44,24:02, how ones appearance has no space and credence in this world of today "Yes Ajay Gupta though abdul who is grigamba boss colonil mental inculcated into poor africans by their masters as way of dividing us Melusi the home affairs guy "They say he was born in KZN...but we don't believe it Former Minister of Finance grigamba ia a racial foul word whose hidden or open meaning insinuate hared and rejection along ethnical or tribal lines.i guess so 
25:03,28:55, @GEORGE SOLOMON BANDA do you watch Izikhokho they usually joke using that word Guptas...are controlling the country guys...WOW NOW WE KNOW.. "ooh no Every department there's a Gupta brother.. melusi Gigaba is the blood of this country n he deserve respect no matter he have made some mistake Zuma n Gupta's ya neh @noko yamebetlwa...What RESPECT are you talking about baba? Gupta's. family was governing the country n appointing ministers We are not going to respect criminals 
29:47,33:14, siphiwe mathibela human being deserve respect bra no matter what they do Ajay even promised Mentor that sge will be the Minister "Yes @noko yamebetlwa respect I agree but they have cases to respond too regardless of position they hold in gvt he is not a criminal boss he made mistakes The truth will come out very soon... @noko yamebetlwa respect is earned bro is not something that you can demand. You get it through your conduct yes Abdul they will come answer the question I agree @abraham rambuda @Mohammed Abdul tell them guys!! 
33:58,35:56, corruption is not a mistake @noko yamebetlwa Noko ukhuluma ngani? Does that mean we people kills and rape we must respect them because they made a mistake? so everyone In jail is not a criminal bt made a mistake???? @ noko come my guy anyone who holds a higher office must conduct him/herself in a justified manner "These Ministers and other government officials who signed any documentation that allowed corruption and fraud with state funding to happen Nothing can justify corruption mathibela this people were used bra n u can't tell me u never make corruption on steal in ur life bra our people lived in shacks long time but all of a sadden ANC government spent millions of billions at GUPTAS Anc must fall Why do you allow to be Used on that office? A mistake is you do once not for all these years and then you tell us they made a mistake?mistake my foot!! 
36:37,38:26, ANC renewal wasting money at end no one will be prosecuted watch the space!!!!!!!!!! "corruption is corruption its not a mistake And go to jail there is no one will have criminal charges here is just inquiry thw biggest mistake was the ANC running this country... The IFP or any other party would have done a much better job... @ nomthandazo true that imagine how many RDP houses would b built with all that money "JZ was and is a gullible to be fool on everything from woman’s body Abdul over my dead body no one will pay here boss 
38:27,40:18, "another day We must strike..shut down everything if nobody is going to jail Imvuselelo ANC yes Nomtha @noko yamebetlwa with guidance from the PP and recommendations from the judge they can open a case my guy "I think only men can help this enquiry this guy has the most awful teeth - yuck msholozi is going to Jail..this it too damning for him to walk scotch free.... People stop undermining Mentor..she tried her best 
41:18,42:42, @J Ganasan ....so much humor..lol somebody give Maseko water...he is struggling Mentor testified about things that happened 8 years ago and others are testifying about things that are more recent. corruption e tlo nna ele teng mo south africa it doesnt help to cofess @Mzala ...thank you very much.. people much listen carefully people are going to jail Mzala - tru. 8 years ago Mentor had the body of a supermodel Imagine such audacity from the Guptas "She tried speaking controversies 
42:42,44:31, Maseko is mentioning Gigaba... meaning this thing is new @J Ganasan No comment 😀😀 All of this is about 8 years ago "Gupta behaved like many rich fellows Abdul boss this is south Africa that I know man this won't go anywhere man if they wanted to arrest people they should have lock all this people who involved n take them to court not inquiry can anyone tell who is in jail right now as a result of sittings or enquiries Maseko was GCIS CEO when Mandela died and that was not 8 years ago. no one Frog hahaha Segwagwa After the enquiry it's gonna be court proceedings. The enquiry can only make recommendations and by that time maybe Zuma will be dead 
45:17,46:50, @noko yamebetlwa I agree but rightfully a criminal has a place in jail or payback the money eg check the Marikana Inquiry "Why the ANC was sleeping all of the days Maseko is trying to tickle our ears with some additional information here aw Philani Madlala true though maybe the old man will be death than QUE PEDO LOCOOOOOS! """ministers surmount to saxonwold"" lol" @Ibo Thabo Seconded....why "Me acuerdo de ese wey que está hablando XD 
47:12,48:59, Marikana commission was worse coz they wasted the millions after it government had to pay those families the question is -How was Zuma Captured??? "@ Philani I want Malema to cross examine Gigaba after his whitness🤣😂😂😂😂😂 if you are politic lover be prepared to be played Mr Jackie Ramaphosa how a u n Ndaa how much did Zuma get ? Greetings sons and daughters of the land @noko yamebetlwa so you agree an inquiry produces some results 
49:06,50:59, He got Nkandla😂🤣🤣😂😂 What people here think for those South Africans still standing & supporting JZ? "Gupta must be feeding Zuma and his ministers lots of curry and whiskey. And when they leave  adv maleka is seeking a newspaper headline ajay guptar its a stering Abdul inquiry is a waste money bra while we know who is guilty nobody will ever know exactly what was looted and what Jz got. naive can our judges sentence Zuma Please 
51:04,52:24, Fakey is supposed to return with a bombshell on 1994 capture @noko yamebetlwa Now you're taking...Who is guilty vele? "I just wish this commission can be done in 6 months compared to what they previously predicted {2 years} which will be too long. People must be jailed here @noko yamebetlwa now you talking my guy who is guilty Mathibela Zuma is the main man Saxonworld was a regular cabinet meeting venue. "I've been saying for long now.. Zuma is gonna end up with a hefty fine lets drop this commission and have one on HOW CYRIL MADE HIS MILLIONS i think they must call Guptas to came answer all allegations but no where to be found 
53:44,55:15, "maybe mr Zuma did get R600 Abdul and Mathibela Zuma is the one who is guilty here coz he fails to govern the country n gave Guptas powers to control everything Jacop Zuma needs a heavy punishment for what he did to this country Lets invest in Bitcoin so we can control our own finances....Govt and Banks are failing the communities "I always wonder why the BLF continue doing so What did Zuma owe to these Gupta guys?? "Don't judge people calling them names he owe them this country Jakobo Zuma must b locked up 
55:30,56:33, But what if he had refused? "don't blame pres zuma Curry corruption is vast and deceptive @noko yamebetlwa is it only JZ? I guess also some of his ministers also got pieces of the pie baked by e guptas "This is simply a waste of public money "@Liwalam Madikiza this is just a waste of state resources. at the end of all this no one will be charged. South Africa should consider becoming a colony of AUstralia or outsource the government to New Zealand But he dumped so many people that really helped him 
56:53,59:26, Abdul remember Zuma was sending Guptas to those people have piece of pie Yes Jason - we all know ANC is corrupt to the core . full of useless thieves "Where are they? You won’t find Gupta here I assumed if they will come to testify BITCOIN GUYS.....Do Your Research and leave money politics to politicians....CREATE OWN WEALTH. peter-pott you can't say that about Gordan and Jonas this person who's coughing really must go get Benylin during the break. Or at least cough away from the mic 😎😂😂 Pheladi lamola ganasan! every where is like this. We heard yesterday that steinhoff r12 billion pension money is a permanent loss. gone. money for 1.1 million employees benylin😂🤣🤣🤣 
59:28,1:01:53, @Thando Nkutha who are you reffeing to? Pheladi Lamola hahaha😂😂😂 😂😂 no it's too much "this is real governance @Thando Nkutha 😂😂😂😂😂 Minister Chabane now....that means all our minsters are employed by the Guptas.. voting for Zumas is like assuring poverty and rejecting basic human needs Invest in Crypto currency.....IF MONEY IS GONE IT IS GONE ....we as the community can learn new ways of securing wealth without passing it to the govt 🤞iStrue "Ouch...@Thando Nkutha 
1:02:12,1:05:25, he is scared to implicate CR in this evidence😀😀😀 "Why are we discussing Zuma its here.. They will try and keep the name CR17 out of it because that is another can of worms "answer Zuma is the crime boss for the Simone fact he had executive authority. ask roads lead to him and his ANC faction @peter pott colaborate to do what? Bostol...for the one with flu @Mathe - The problem is their matter is not an ordinary corruption matter. it involves a lot of people who where acting under his instructions. So we need to have a proper trail of events to persecute 
1:05:28,1:07:42, "This is the best testimony so far. It is specific We need to understand that most people that were intitialy in this syndicate are still in high positions today "😦Not ""thuma mina""😂😂" rambuda! can the confirm if he really spoke to them There goes again the R96 million comedy Advocate Maleka is so thorough. and makes it easy to have the links @Lorna Kavanagh Adv Maleka is the champ! My challenge is we are having a comission with missing witnesses. 
1:07:42,1:08:54, He was taking Mentor to Sun City for a weekend of bonking lool aooo mr Maleka really ooooooh! spicy "will they use whatever evidence they're gathering against zuptas in the court hearing coming up who and when is the next high profile witness?? like a minister We need the Guptas themself to come and testify "@ Marvel The Tshwane council is live. The Guptas must testify too 
1:09:06,1:10:50, @J Ganasan What are you smoking bro? the Guptas will never get extradited back to SA. GOlf tournament ? Likely story. Bet he scored a hole in one Gupta must have supplied the holes The Tshwane council is on fire courtesy of the EFF who brings sanity to SA politics South Africa is now a joke Then this is a fruitless exercise because we are acquitting people that add no value to the case.

People are just giving their versions @Jerry - The councillors are in the corrum to remove useless Solly through the motion of no confidence. I dont make fun of this guys teeth this is a lawyer been though many 👊 "i remember when Oscar told us what happened the night we lost Reeva 
1:32:22,1:33:58, The cabinet meetings and the whole government is a circus run by clowns @gana so are you Orefile - that is such a lame story Now I understand why the departments were instructed to use the New Age to advertise government events and vacancies. Jimmy Manyi must come and testify here. Saxonworld is Union Buildings. We just didnt know What is the Chairperson saying? 😂 The truth needs to be tested. always Maseko is lying to the core 
1:34:00,1:35:48, We cant believe everything we hear at first glance "nawe you should have stayed home. you wanted msholozi to say to I "" phuma la" "If its hard true "how many name are out now i honestly believe no one is being 100% truthful. And that is the reason some are refusing to come forward. This enquiry should have the whole cabinet as witnesses And so people believe Maseko!!! "The way Maseko is so confident and chilled  whats wrong clanesh shongwe corruption value chain 
1:35:51,1:37:52, "Maseko as are all ANC He rehearsed his lies the last time i heard on that cabinet testifying was'rubber stamp' Its no longer about the organisation now @Sipho Mahlangu. Its about the country and the fact that he sold us to foreigners. "The only people that know exactly what happened are Duduzane "don't say that. Steinhoff whose a foreingner moonman Mr Maseko is just bitter just like his sacked freind Pravin "@ Thando 
1:38:10,1:39:33, @Orefile Macheoane you are ryt and they dont even care about this stupid as they know it wont have any impact "we need to give Zuma a round of a plause Msholozi Masekop's minister bent over backwards ? Are they both gay ? "Can we be reminded that only white collar people have privileges of inquiries This is so sad Maleka - cmon - why didnt you ask that question Is your family in politics? "If Pravin and Mcebisi were not sacked  
1:39:47,1:41:02, @Millicent Shozi No we must give Zuma a round of applause because he is Zulu from KZN "@Colanesh "The circus started in 1994 "government appoint staff @Pastoolio Poggempoel you are right Circus started in 1652...when that Ship came here There was a vacancy in DPSA @moolman you are right I really mean even the country suffered as the party too so no country is rule without the political party Maseko is not bothered by what happens from here on in. For him this is leave. 
1:41:11,1:42:43, "If pravin and Mcebisi were not fired there wouldnt be such a circus Could the colleague cough away from the mike...pfffew @abraham zulu and my husband Is it possible Chabane`s death was Assassination? This is all politics "as you occupy that post thank you @Mzalwane Mzala. how does the public benefit from this? Every state is captured the difference here is that Guptas together with Zuma were trying to take the captured state form the Rupert and the others who are the current captures. 
1:42:45,1:43:52, It sounds like the Xoliswa Sibeko case as DG of Sport and Correctional service Commissioner. What difference will knowing the truth make? An assassination called car accident @happymaboane. The other party in that accident must come and explain. Maseko comes across as an incompetent fool. Waste of taxpayers money @J Ganasan : like the rest of government officials? its true Siyabonga How much did they offer you to leave ? I'm happy a few understand the gist of all this "No one is going to jail. No one will ever say ""i stole money"" 
1:44:02,1:44:55, there is another nxasana? how much wena did you get Mr Maseko? @pheladi lamola You're welcome Zuma was worse @J Ganasan the rain started beating us when Thabo Mbeki was removed. @Noko - all ANC is garbage They are dismantling everything assocaited with Zuma..

How about you go to the commission as judge Zondo has been pleading with people who can assist the nation. You can go pinpoint where Maseko's lies @Thando Nkutha 😑😀😀🤣 @ganasan your father jan van reebeck brutaly stole our land that a fact Those who refused to listen to Jacob Zuma in a May Day rally were not white. and they love him too @Thando Nkutha see Gasanan u cant write my name correct but u want me to vote for u selling S.A. to India imagine
