"failure of anc during negotiations with apartheid government This build up before shooting Zuma down saying I didn’t select committee did 🤥🚿 Zuma is intelligent guys @funicanz remember van Rooyen being made finance minister ...he was a backbencher and he only lasted a weekend 
31:55,32:33, what he answers now will come back later when they raise the removal of Finance minister over a week end when the rest of ANC or Government had agreed to it. he did it on his own. making the decision. Waiting patiently to hear if he forgets something there are report to deffence bossis. 26 yooh this line off Questioning is smart My President wat did he just answer Funny how people are so angry just because JZ is not saying what they want to hear 27

We love it when the comrats fight each other. 29 Why do they keep asking a question to Zuma and then keep putting it to him endless different ways in order for that buffoon to answer it ? Zuma won't let the truth reign @Matu. only a politician can do that. Zuma was a real tiger. "If is true what Zuma is saying on their ANC & Government rules of check & balance before they employ people

Silili are you ready to appear forma depurty Yebo baba president does not sit on that meeting. @micheal...even though he is not educated but he was your president and number 1 citizen...what do you have? the throat is disturbing me

"@Sonwabo wiseman mhlaba  CR is mentioned Zuma must get some halls sweets to clear his throat😁 at times if its decided in the NEC so he makes the final decision as a President of NEC 🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸 
36:18,36:43, This man is not telling the Nation everything The big question "Innocent until proven guilty  I have more respect for my dog "@Heather Govender ​Its ""this guy can truly get away with murder"" I think he askedquestions in a long winding way but to encircle him with untruths." I love Zuma's wisdom 👏👏👏🤷‍♂️ Really makes you wonder just exactly what the President was there for as he seems to be involved with NOTHING. He has yet to admit to his involvement with anything If that is the case....then during your term Zuma.... this committee was absolutely useless at their jobs... based on the crooks they appointed to your cabinet 
36:46,37:18, @Dominic. Please go back to Zuma's opening remarks. you will realize that all this was done. Zuma was plotted. media was part of that. remember media can make you and destroy you again. Yes at times so CR17 you are in baba.

I wonder where interrogator was in 1990 I don't know Simply Yes or No otherwise this will drag on for weeks

1:12:50,1:13:32, Siyabonga I totally agree. There is no consideration of the people...only to save their own skins. very sad that Leadership has come to this. STUPID ZULU BOY ZUMA SUPPORTERS ARE THE SAME AS ZUMA THEY DISGUST ME well - don't only tell us about how the process is run. Did you use your powers as a president to overlook such processes? yay or nay? the head of intelligence at work... lool. Ramaphosa said to Zondo. Please help him Or I am DEAD. keep on provoking him to the last degree. A lie detector Instrument would have an early Christmas during these 3 days. Gerry Nel whats your baba 
1:13:45,1:15:12, Hehehehm this zondo commission is not helping the poor people of this country but makes them even poorer Mr 4 days minister... Zuma and the Guptas looted the coffers. This is said but no one tells us how much money he took and into which of his bank accounts the loot that collapsed our country is. This is strange. ZUMA OUT PLAYED ALL YOU SO CALLED SMART PEOPLE. NOW YOU ARE SITTING HERE COMPLAINING WITH NO PROOF WHATSOEVER 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥃 NPA must charge Lum'evuthela with Treason. We must stop him from ukugedla esihleka now at once. kuruma is that a fact or opinion? "there is no party in the world who forget about its voters and elect opposition "You don't need lie detector if you have brains 
1:15:14,1:16:18, ZUMA IS SURROUNDED BY POWERFUL WIZARDS people have no jobs yet you setting there winding They must watch Zuma he is going to steal sugar. Zuma Bots are like infestation. they must run to the light non-sense musa Does anyone know how much money zuma stole? "Zuma is a pillar in the ANC AS FOR STEALING SUGAR LOL Zuma and his laugh 
1:16:20,1:16:59, @Zaca: I agree 100%... Zuma's reign is not just a one man mission! It's an empire! There are much more powerful pieces of puzzle behind him. He is the best i have seen in SA! Tambo in 1990/1991 warned Anc about Pravin and others who were spies within the Anc we are not playing here @Caswell Mamkeli Blame the ANC and nobody else. I must have blocked about 60 since yesterday You are a joke @i am free learn your history Zondo is top class ZUMA MUST GO ZUMA GO If coffers were looted should subtraction not tell us how much he stole? 
1:17:09,1:17:53, @Helen Terry ....it is so sad....party politics destroy the world. You cant get anything done for the people..... ATLEAST A CRIMINAL KEEPS MONEY HE STOLE. ZUMA SENDS TO THE GUPTA ACCOUNTS @Beauprevin Leeroth when we say jump you must just jump Just Vybin @Goitsimodimo. it's a fact. look Zuma knows everything about ANC. in fact that's the only person acting politics not money. first do you know how did Ramaphosa become rich? don't play with Ubaba . #zumamustfall @jacob - white people did a sterling job in colonising your mind - black on black hatred maybe you did not lose a relative to AIDS during Thabo Mbekis term but I did smoking a spliff what i have done mr former president 
1:18:28,1:19:00, HE IS A TRIBALIST @letsclean kuruman lol Zuma was best friends with guilty looting Guptas xD. he knows how to play these game lol Thando caps Msholozi ngithi nkosi kayibe nawe imbumbulu zenhlamvu mazi ngakuthinti How much money did zuma steal? if its not on his bank statement he should be charged with money laundering because we know he looted the coffers right? its a habit "Guys "Does anyone know who has more bodygaurds 
1:19:12,1:19:51, Yes...very well trained by the Commies.. if you don't have anything to say just shut up They should be equal @Jacob how do you know that - are you a forensic expert? @I Am Free ya neh. no one ever even talks about the Anglo Boere war. "funny how Da were friends with the Gupta's but no SOE Board Posts Not Only About ANC Loyalty... But About Self Enrichment. NOTICE no throat clearing when he is telling the truth Mmmm 
1:19:54,1:20:28, man of influence Zuma tell the truth What’s happening Marvel. One of them is a has been. "How onearth can everyone be wrong you moron This is not a Banana Site this one ok just shut up "the most dangerous weapon the oppressor have against the oppressed @Marvel Ramatshela work benefits "The former president doesn't lose any benefit 
1:20:33,1:21:34, @Mariki Erasmus Zuma probably also believes the earth is flat ironically Zuma has had capitalist behaviour since '94. @Gerald Beukes lol nice bot Yes...the Firewater only works when the crap starts coming out of his mouth... Yes Devan.... Let him tell the truth Zuma has just b3en conard unaway @Bronx Wavy Zuma isnt capitalist. The whole ANC is socialist. if ANC is ruling this country what is the need of the need of these other political parties ? 
1:21:49,1:22:19, Destruction Boy 11.30 @sbonelo qiniso ​ when it will resume? Funny how never coughs when he speaks when there is no controversial point Zuma got more bodyguards than CR..and Aggrizi....they they add more yesterday. Zondo has a very deep voice but he is an intelligent man.. unlike Zuma who must go to jail. "Viewing some of your comments i can conclude that u don't care about what the former president has to say whether agreeing or disagreeing with some of the witnesses statements @Devan.that's a concept injected the minds of our people. Media played a big role to destroy Zuma. because he was opening our eyes. corruption was there before Zuma. Since 1994 til now 700billion gone So the are factions in the ANC @Thando Nkuna - No. we don't expect him to tell us the truth. just following due processes 
1:22:44,1:23:30, Esq." I just hope South Africans will have the same energy when the question of the land will rise. yes umsholozi wil walk out free "we are fast enough to judge Mr Zuma even if he is still in process. wow and you all know nothing about what is really happening hear Zumas body guards cost the taxpayer R2. 6 Billion a year. Zuma costs too much much money to protect and must go. The ANC can't run their own party( being sued for unpaid bills) and they can't run the country. @letsclean kuruman how was he opening our eyes? He's the one that made the 700 billion go POOF. He never mentioned corruption or any fraud within government but he is NR1. So the President is involved no longer the deputy president Let’s talk about Rupert’s threat to collapse the economy.. 
1:23:38,1:24:36, khambule inkosi ayibi naye umuntu otshontsela abanye "When u think about the term ""OXYGEN THIEF"" what comes to your mind first?????" @Musa Bakiti👏👏 What is the purpose this enquiry mara "@letsclean kuruman In JHB alone Zuma made fees free to destabilize the ANC and the economy... lol why did he wait until he was pushed to leave??? again mocking you blind Zuma Bots Jase. you are giving to much power to one man. what i like its when zondo explain to him to understand they want different story from previous witness thats all Your head is stuck up too high up your behind @Yin yang 
1:24:42,1:25:26, I think Mr Zondo handles the commission very well because he gives everyone a chance to express his/her views like the lawyers. This inquiry is a waste of money "Zuma is the only President who make whites Monopoly unstable  school hl @Thando same here. its disgusting I thought that the deputy President has little to do with appointments of ministers and it is the President who should be involved.. infact I read this in an article. I thought I’m alone @Thando Nkutha @Thando Nkutha I expected that brilliant answer. 1st prize to you Zuma did steal YES. But how much? Anyone with proof? But there is a proof of how ramaphosa made is money. looool.Zuma was dealing with Cash. thats a mafia style. New Age newspaper and ANN7 was wise 
1:25:31,1:27:03, This is South Africa @i am free @Mxolisi Thango Viva tsotsi. He stole money from the poor and allowed Indians to loot us. Explain how WMC exists when the Gov gets 45% taxes on them???? There is no white monopoly.. just black majority i can't stand people who support something they dont even know. makes me puke . I LOVE JOHNNY CLEGG. RIP. A TRUE HERO Everyone is asking for their selected version of the truth to be told by the former president and anything outside that is lies and yet say they only want justice. "Malema always touches on the pieces needed to destroy Zuma's empire and he is as always ignored as he is marked as a barking dog! It will take removing ANC from power @born free you are right Zuma is the most expensive president who does not deserve the pegs. "This inquiry is playing with the lives of black people.Where is the issue of the land which Steve Biko  
1:27:04,1:28:32, @Mxolisi Thango WMC was a term created by people in Europe to cause racial tension in SA. You are falling for propaganda. Even the ANC themselves said WMC doesnt exist. You are just racist. Letsclean kuruman. You are 100% correct and no one is questioning that hey 10 years of ppl dying because of lack of service delivery.. and ppl are cheering msholzi USA CANT DO ANYTHING TO SOUTH AFRICA. we don't need the usa help with ZUMA. due processes must be followed. hate him or not but he still has rights and deserves to be treated fairly "Send Zuma to North Korea if zuma is your hero than your suffering from anusnisity They gave us freedom and took the money.......now we realize freedom without moolah is no freedom usa ignored Zuma as well. they are comfortable with weak leadera Welcome back 
1:28:35,1:29:44, @Musa Bakiti Land doesnt created nearly as much wealth as education does. The industrial revolution led us to be able to create billions from one computer. zuma😍😍😍 Well said Devan 👏 tea break Zuma has fallen and you should let him enjoy his retirement. White people are busy following this case and I believe it is no longer about the corruption but the race. "56 hopefully he checked the pages @Gerrie Thomas Well with this ancient land mentality there is no hope. @daven you have no clue about land 
1:29:47,1:30:09, Gera Yhooo how many protectors does he have? Agreed 🤦‍♂️ "she is expressing her own ideas Gerald😂🤣 what is Zuma hiding in his bunker underneath Nkandla? Zuma NXAMALALA! No one is digging up the skeletons of Deklerk because he is white. 
1:30:10,1:30:38, Zuma someone please ring the bell for them to come back Zuma I hope Zuma goes to Polsmoor No teabreak for Zuma....it is only mutibreak for him lol @Devan "forgive Nd forget Zuma WHITE 
1:30:39,1:31:07, what are the elements of the crime called state capture? Zuma must stop saying i dont know and i dont remember but he can remember 19's things @Xolelo Mboniswa You clearly dont understand how law works. The Constitution inst reteroactive/ zuma for life thank you I am through @Devan. Do you think Mbeki didn't steal? Billion of rands were not stolen while he was president ? They did. But as for Zuma it's not about money. this is personal. if anyone can proof. I will suppt time to roll up Zuma has blood on his hands @Xolelo Mboniswa However Zuma did commit these crimes in a democracy 
1:31:08,1:32:12, @Thembinkosi Simelane we are still surrounded by the statues of our oppressors in our own land. president my president Amandla @letsclean kuruman the Guptas is all proof we need. They had propaganda ANN7 and they stole money. Zuma was best friends with them. viva South AfricA.....get rid of this communist agent....land thief Amandla awethu Ngiyaphakamisa ngoZuma mina la mnxn I wonder what Zuma will do for you Mr Beakus??? Please i dont love Zuma dom kop like him yerrr never I AM Free that is your opinion. just a quick refresher in his reign millions died just because he refused to acknowledge HIV/AIDS as a disease 
1:32:15,1:33:00, zuma only remembers things that happened fourty years ago and not things that happened in nine years ago. is Zuma suffering from Dimentia or amnesia? "it's a white man Media they want us to believe that President Zuma is corrupt n we hate him  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 loyalty to the ANC will get you a nice job "@Nonto Nxamalala no formal education but you can show your intellectual without university degrees hahahahah!!!!! ZUMA IS A TRUE DEFINITION OF BEING DELINQUENT @Nonto Ngubane and no money spent in basic education. Kids dying in pit toilets 
1:33:03,1:33:55, "President Zuma wil be supported you like or not This man is refusing to answer any question directly. Mxolisi only a few will understand "in life there is a clever thief and a stupid thief  Factor? we already knw wat kind off people hate Zuma tomch and they don't even so sure why? @Born free Zuma has blood in all parts of his body Pres d@Alwin Britz look in the Western Cape. The DA does the same thing @Mxolisi Thango still explain to me how can whites rule the economy when people pay 45% taxes???? There are more black millionaires than whites and black middle class is far bigger?? 
1:33:58,1:34:16, siyabukela from Eswatini Nonto Ngubs how old are u Theres a whole lot that needs to be confirmed here at the enquiry but i doubt the objective shall be achieved since Mr Zuma has sudden memory challenges Loyalty Over Country Zuma "loyalty to the party is a vehicle to get appointed in government. if your response was guinean Loyalty to ANC gets you gunned down at your home and no conclusion zuma Nxamalala 
1:34:21,1:35:06, Zondo heard exactly correct... he did say that Zuma Factor "Zuma go hide with your Billionaire mate zuma pls dnt Lough He said in parliament that the ANC comes before the country. Zuma By looking at most of these comments it is very clear that the biggest problem in our country is education..... test 
1:35:11,1:35:24, weNja yeBhunu phuma kuzuma mnxn @Dominic. I also remember that very well "Deploy according to merit  it was once said. history will repeat itself @Michael Motsepe I think he is developing Dimentia. or Amnesia.. Old man nonetheless @Devan here and now education is free the Oppernheimers must sponsor education of every african child in the years of Ramaphosa`s reign😉 "@Banele Nxumalo No the President dont know that Zuma & Bashir....human rights ....atrocity 
1:35:26,1:36:08, @Devan. Who introduced Guptas to Zuma? All this was influenced to remove Zuma because he was not a begger to white monopoly. He showed bravery to fight that. Media companies are owned by spies in SA It is clearly that this constitution was not drafted or written by our people because it is crucifying them. it is the reason why we wont get our land back ANC FIRST that's the motto "We support Former President Zuma i Today my president is talking... Devan has amnesia period!! I don’t know what do you mean Thomas by that? 
1:36:10,1:36:29, "This is being misunderstood Yes a grate man!! The screen is blank please fix mr/mss Tech @Nonto Ngubane okay there you lost me. @Sipho Dlamini was ? what about now "@Gerrie Thomas you’re right I don't know Loyalty needed in our daily lives... Zuma once told us the ANC comes before the county. 
1:36:40,1:36:57, Zuma dont understand "Zuma Why is the CJ entertaining Jacobo........ how was this man president of the republic when he doesn't seem to know anything!!? Dnot flippen mention zj and bashir in one sentence u nuts @Xolelo Mboniswa yes persecuting someone because he stole government xD Showerhead got no experience Kwena Daniel Just Refresh Why dont you just make everything free in a country thats so poor already 
1:36:58,1:37:28, "Sipho Dlamini we shall take ""he was""...thank you." "I f he was still at the helm I can see Zuma is comfortable with this line of questions Ben barnard.....i also want to know....i think this moron was behind chris hani murder Very paly..paly...indeed.. It's becoming clear that the biggest hindrance to SA improving is the ANC's factional battles laughs politely. We should also remember that Mr Zuma is the one who set up the Commission of Enquiry. I am pretty sure he would never channel a vehicle that would challenge or destroy him. kodwa baba I loyalty yani nje from the beginning???🙄🙄 205 page 
1:37:30,1:37:47, @Nonto Ngubane yes the oppenheimers pay half of all their money to the ANC. So come again?? @Gerald Beukes . Is there really another 98%. I cant believe that zuma left that much for the others to steal. Page 405 "Zuma is lying...other countries dont deploy people because they have the struggle credentials MY PRESIDENT zuma "@Devan. My point is don't you think that If Guptas did steal with Zuma as people say Zuma must answer Zondo don't wast time why didn't he push the issue of radical economic transformation when he took over in 2009. south africans are not as foolish as he thinks. 
1:37:49,1:38:23, Devan what did he steal? u can't hook Zuma so cheaply they must let zuma speak just like he did on Monday and cancel the Q&A "Sjoe "Keletso""Bizoski"" Manyike is the guy we should be talking about and trying to make sure he lives to tell the truth." It is just sad to know a teenager has more sense than this person who once led our country😱 @letsclean kuruman oh tell me then why was all their assets in SA frozen? Black people will never unite... true kuruman 
1:38:26,1:38:48, "Racists thanks HANK @letsclean kuruman why did they flee the country??? ONLY THE GUILTY PROTECT ZUMA AND SUPPORT HIM we owe this men an apology as a country is still mr zuma on point? who is the ANC real Devan?🤗 👍 Zuma is wearing glasses to look intelligent 
1:38:55,1:39:32, no @Nonto Ngubane okay now youre just a silly troll You cannot be loyal to those who betray u... first inkinga nikhuluma English kodwa namazulu there no freedom in S.A .Zuma akacala he follow the produce which have been use by Mandela .Bheki zuma has point here "let's move from this ""loyalty ""they confusing ubaba......" we already knw u white bought our comrade to turn against each other because of our land so Zuma can only recall his exile days but won't recall his meetings while he is a president that's nice The I don’t knows will come again 
1:39:39,1:40:05, Pretorius is Tsonga swiiiiswiiiswiii if white people did enough to earn our trust we shouldn't have been in this mess "Zuma @Derek Main agreed factionalism is the major hindrance HE REMEMBERED DID YOU KNOW - "loyalty "Devan that is very offensive takin into account you only joined in to entertain yourself not to understand DO YOU KNOW
