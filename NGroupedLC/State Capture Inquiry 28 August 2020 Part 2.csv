This guy is joke and its goes for the rest You know what would be more interesting and important than this commission? An actual prosecution of those convicted... otherwise this doesn't accomplish much... value = quality/cost .... the more you reduce the cost the more value. But don’t explain this to him... accounting officer... Hofemeyer this one We should have brought outside experts from another country to investigate this mess and thieves.By now am sure we would have had closure. 
2:55:06,2:57:13, @Lovejoy we would have been done by now if he was Hofmayered They should open up a can of Hofmeyer next time... huh! irregular expenditure is a governance problem... this man is confused...
