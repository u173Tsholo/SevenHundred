Gupta's Total nonsense @Val Spiers "sound man This man and his entire board was sacked to make way for the Gupta captured under Lyn Brown yes well he could have made this public then

Guys I dont understand one thing here.once u invited at Guptor compound u never stop going bk.but u claim they are crooks.ayihlangani.people must be arrested. Trolls having a field day #The real Youtuber? Who are you addressing? Thank-you Micheal LOL I don‚Äôt follow # The real Youtuber ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
27:41,31:24, I hate blacks @Michael it will be nice tto have the real ANC cadres who are implicated arrested...ie the ministers who followed Gupta orders...that will be a great start but now they are on the list for parliament Darwin's theory is not accurate. I don't believe in his theory All those implicated in the Bosasa theft are still free and laughing at tgeir compatriots...Koko is a case in point "Nope I am not sure if we are the whole from those appearing to this commision.if not they must go court dan they will b honest.they are trying to protect their names. yes Micheal so true @Sipho Mkize then you have a pseudo name.. except that the Zonda gang will find the holes. 
31:38,39:52, Forget it then #The real Youtuber copyright claimer Goodbye - no point in seeing your arrogance! Wild think so @SABC Digital News This is like being a stuck record. Please increase the volume. Please increase volume. Tku Gupta see this guy sallooge doesn‚Äôt shake they went to mr Burger Just my humble opinion: He is trying to ooze confidence - overly so. @makhosi nobhatyi looks like it "What package / golden handshake did he receive "@Michael the majority of the people who appeared up till now came forward on their own...they were not subpoenaed...the real culprits have not appeared yet...where is Duduzane 
41:49,45:47, "@Anne M this people to me were too greedy and had no money So he new about it ALL - continued & remained dumb? I have come to the conclusion that most commenters on this forum never read anything that is already in the public domain about state capture...they comment as if everyone here is a crook it seems to me that the sound is always softer in the afternoon than in the mornings. I really struggle to hear what is being said Most who have worked for State entities are corrupt Major corruption began when Zuma became President. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èbite @Esm√© Herbst Agree 
45:52,50:30, It seems to me for the last ten years.our head of state never act like one.we are now suffering bcz of his ignorance.country is now in crisis.they are sitting in their luxury houses.they Very true because Zuma has no intelligence .So his ministers and comrades did as Zuma did. Magda Seguin I agreed with you problem was Zuma to be honest Is Ntshebe a surname? @makhosi nobhatyi Not only Zuma I know corruption has always taken place but my goodness nor on a scale such as this. @Val Speirs there I agree with you Not only Zuma but the ANC comrades when there is a leadership vacuum thats what happen..during mandela & mbeki the leadership was strong 
50:47,55:00, Comrades is a communist term Look y load shadding now.stop servicing ur car and c how long it takes u.now he did Eskom guys stop servicing power station.are they stupid or it just simple sabotage.they call themself professionals. @Val Speirs no man..there i disagree..comrade means friends "Derek main Zuma make it worse than b4 Mr mbeki was trying to fight this behavior during his term @Michael Michael they were channeling the money to themselves (bonuses) then theres no money to service power stations Comrade was used in Cuba when terrorists from Africa were trained in Communist Cuba. eskom @Val Speirs no man..there was no terrorists..there were freedom fighters The man is tired now. 
55:09,57:02, sound Felix my point.but there's no accountability. @makhosi nobhatyi What I am saying is that there are many others who are just as corrupt as Zuma who are still in government. They were Terrorists trained by the communist Cubans and Russia The PMFA already showed that VR Laser was a shelf company so Stefan Burger is looking for a scapegoat @Val Speirs One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter. @Desmond Masilela let him spill the beans so that we finish connecting all the dots! Go n vote for ANC AGAIN @Thando Nkutha Just what Essa & Guptas did 
57:14,58:54, @Felix Muyoba. His tired he might make mistake now. "@Val Speirs terrorists to you but to us they were freedom fighters "Derek main this is clear let heat the head first connect the dots were in trouble Essay mastermind Must vote wisely you don't want this country to become a Marxist state like Zimbabwe was under Mugabe who was another terrorist but fortunately for him he was educated in London. @Desmond Masilela imagine how many days our friend agrizzi tesified.. Those people just breaking laws. @makhosi nobhatyi The easiest way to get rid of as many corrupt people in government as possible is to vote out the ANC. Coffee shop and Saxonwold meetings trying to impress him with who they know - same story we've heard before 
58:57,1:01:10, "Watch again Agrizzi took 2 wiks @Makhosi definitely treason violating his oathvof office I am voting for John Steenhuizen No he didn't South Africa was handed on a platter to the Guptas by Zuma Thando cacile leyo @Val Speirs with his matric qualification? Derek main I disagree with totally you cannot vote out Anc because the act of individuals putting ANC in disputes 
1:01:11,1:03:20, @Felix Muyoba. Yes I do. But Agrizz is strong than this guys. His got big tommy remember? "@Desmond Masilela hahaha Agrizzi was telling the truth @Michael Michael. LOL what about this witness? @Felix Muyoba. LOL @makhosi nobhatyi At least you're no longer saying it was just Zuma. The problem is that the ANC has so many corrupt individuals that they have tainted the entire party. Lyn Brown masterminded the decline of Denel..leaving it in tatters and brilliant minds sacked...those people are now headhunted overseas for their expertise "Transnet is coming Koko did the same to Eskom... 
1:03:21,1:05:33, Desmond dont think he is telling the story as is or wt?? @x. .x keep on dreaming And Moyane did it at SARS too... "@x. .x you want homelands again Dudu at SAA....the list goes on @makhosi nobhatyi It could be said that the ANC appears to be a party that attracts corrupt individuals. Nine wasted years x x great idea much like America Thando sorie if it sound like y u ask such a question.i should have put it politely.accept my apology. 
1:06:03,1:09:53, @Michael Michael. Yes i trust this man. But he looks exhausted. "@Val Speirs and @x. .x this is africa not america..here it cant work Desmond yes.is like wn soccer player miss scoring chance we shout.indeed he is exhausted that chair not ryt. "Derek main I understand now where are you up to There is no harm in trying and it is not like homelands it is a more efficient way of governance and accountability. @makhosi nobhatyi Well done but I have made no secret of that - the best thing for SA's future is to get rid of the ANC. @Michael Michael. Exactly. The the coach do replace the player with other player. So let the guy go rest now. will come tomorrow. @Val Speirs when you put borders around towns it means you control movement of people in and out of the town..is that what you want? nope I didn't suggest borders someone else did. 
1:09:58,1:12:15, Desmond let's give them holidy and c them on manday. @x. .x then join EFF @Michael Michael. dont you think there will be sitting Friday? Is this guy a South African?? "üòÉüòÉüòÄ Derek main South Africa know that ANC is the party that presents their cry other parties just cut and paste Desmond dont think so but Mr Zondo will let us know. Me too Thando. I only watched part2. Its very interesting. @Michael Michael he must be a naturalised south african of indian origin Anyone under 35 do not even have lived experience yet....it will be chaos...some cant even read and understand an Act of government 
1:12:21,1:16:41, @Michael Michael. Lets wait and see. Thanks Felix He's South African of Indian descent All those people know nothing about our struggle.somebody just call them to collect money. Judging from what I see on Twitter under 35's are will never be able to govern... "@makhosi nobhatyi Aaah - so you're back to ""only Zuma is corrupt"". All thinking SAfns can see that that is not true - the entire ANC has been corrupted." Derek Main a fish rots from the head and thats the ANC "Zuma saw that there are people who noticed what he did @x.x I said most not all...I know brilliant under 35's bit they are only starting out in their careers and is not interested in politics 
1:16:46,1:20:23, @x. .x Anyone under 35 can't get off their cellphones long enough to run a government. @Derek Main üòÅ yes and what about the fashions @Peter Staffen Yep - and the entire ANC was rotten long ago - now it is decomposing. Guys if I may ask.those who dont want come to the commision wt will going to happen to them like Molefe and Kokos.or they are still coming?? @Michael Michael Yes - they will be summonsed. ok thank u I think that the youngest legitimate Prime Minister is the New Zealand PM aged 39 @Magda Seguin @Michael Michael. All these ppl that are implicated to this. The chair will subpoena them. I hope that they will be subpoenaed...maybe after Agrizzi testifies again later...I would love to see Mokonyane's denials 
1:20:27,1:22:13, @Michael Michael not sure either but it might be that the first thing is voluntary and if people dont come then they will be forced..not sure Desmond ok.could be great. Michael bazawuza berhuqwa yingalo yomthetho. ok Felix "You are right Gigaba is all over the show. "@Michael Michael. Do you think we might leave the big fish and to hear what lies his going to tell the commission? Gigaba The new board that was put there by the Guptas not to hear 
1:23:06,1:26:10, Lynn Brown was not that bad. Desmond wt do u do wn u c police van.i grit them In what universe are we living with Lyn Brown 'not being that bad'? "Mahumapelo brother üò≥üò≥üò≥ that is why denel paid mahumapelo‚Äôs son 1 million bursary ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è tjoo @Ntombethemba Manase Then why did she fire the whole board and not have continuity? @Michael Michael. Myself i just great them nicely Desmond we need the big fish bcz we can all of us eat. She sacked a brilliant board and replaced them with Gupta lackeys who destroyed Denel...catch a wakeup! Desmond bcz me and u we didn't commit any crime.now those wait for Mr Zondo to call them.are they myb hiding something. 
1:27:00,1:30:46, "Big fishes to all SoE Zuma Thanda is a fact.wt the laws says sometime we can is stupid.innocent until proven otherwise @Michael Michael. I need the big one. Sharküêãüêã Lyn Brown's partner recieved a 4x4 from the Guptas...her son in law was also involved in the SARS debacle with van Rooyens appointment as an 'advisor' Desmond ewe me too problem is that those big fishes control the state machnieries thats why they hard targets Felix correct if dont comply they fire u. My bad.I can see now that she did not mean it when she said the new board must not interfere with the work of the executive. Why don‚Äôt they just say that Brown interfered??? 
1:30:59,1:33:18, Desmond it seems they will be sitting on Fridy "Gigaba is facings huge problematic he created "@SABC Digital News Please during the tea break. Pretty please @Michael Michael correct or you disappear from the face of the earth @SABC Digital News Guy trust me. All these guys that are implicated to this. They will just be charged and pay fine thats. NO one will be arrested and put in Jail. trust me. 20 thousand rand fine. Felix they are capable of doing that. "Gigabavis in trouble with the Gupta naturalisation @Desmond Masilela I'm afraid you might be right. 
1:34:08,1:37:51, Koko is very active on Twitter...he is blaming everyone but himself @Derek Main. Jail is made for me and you. If you dont have money you straight to jail. But if you have money they find you guilty and you have fine to pay. @Magda Seguin No surprises there - Koko has shown himself to be a bold-faced liar. you go straight to jail @Desmond Masilela Too true - justice is for the rich. "Magda Seguin he did answer but he thinks parliament was going to entertain him he couldn‚Äôt be able to make sense in wat he was approved for @Derek Main. So this is just a waste of time. If its true something might happen. Why cant they start charging this ppl that are implicated. You become a suspect of killing someone they come and take you put in you in jail until you become clear. What is the different between this implicated once. @Desmond Masilela Not sure why - I suppose they need to un-capture the NPA first. 
1:38:22,1:45:08, Let them start with the process of filling court papers let the court start to do with its duty. @Derek Main. For almost 10yrs we heard about Guptas. No one has taken action against them. no The Guptas did not use any Airport to leave SA. They used OR tambo. Why didnt they stop them from leaving SA? because they where under investigation. @Thando Nkutha. The chair ask for short break untill 16:00pm should be back soon. "To think of us @Thando Nkutha. Not that 100% sure. But they knew they where gonna leave SA @Thando Nkutha. You welcome. The guptas enjoyed the support from the highest office in the land their jet landing at national key point bears testimony to this 
1:45:31,1:52:50, They have their buddies stationed at OR Tambo. @Thando Nkutha. Early when because this allegation started long ago. So much for security üëøüëπ @Thando Nkutha. There's no smoke without fire. "Cherly Carolous @ Thando @Thando Nkutha üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I rest my case. I lost the battle. On that one you right. @Thando Nkutha. These ppl there where all over us. #Thando What did I miss re tomorrow? You talking about the blocking of the roads? @Thando Nkutha üòÇüòÇüòÇ After he meet the Gupta his head started growing non-stop. 
1:55:48,2:13:43, Afraid for losing his job and kept quite @Planeless Pilot thats what I suspect..your are right @Thando Nkutha. They got ubaba. Lucky not me. I know my father. I would suggest everyone please don‚Äôt go Indian restaurant and bar holding executives positions in government others you do things like these ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÄüòÉ Load shedding Yesterday the other guy said that VRLaser only wanted the Denel blueprints. They had no manufacturing capability. Only want to sell South Africa IP to other people. Load shedding? LOL cover ANC time Judge Zono doing a veeeeery nice job. Need to go into action now and lockup a few culprits. 
2:14:43,2:28:00, This load shed is a BIG issue! Our institution canceled a colloquial on Human Rights and Race - where Mama Thuli was going to be a keynote speaker. Lost now the coffee she promised months ago. Eiskom! What he is explaining is what is defined in the World Bank 2001 State Capture document.. State Capture didn't start in South Africa it is a global political phenomena Magda Seguin absolutely @Magda Seguin Zuma and the ANC just perfected it. I encourage you to read Naomi Klein's book called 'Shock Doctrine' True they absolutely did @ Derek Main üôè Namo Amitoufo üôè Honest people's lives was ruined... 
2:29:08,2:31:42, This was a MO throughout state capture...resign or suspend immediatly or golden handshake Totally against labour law Is 3 months salary a golden handshake? what LAW ??????? Labour LAW.... not hem specifically.... NPA heads ...can't recall the names *th *them 
2:32:26,2:44:07, they had no respect for ANY law is what I was alluding to In SA we have the BCEA...Basic conditions of employment act...read it...we also have a labour court I understand @Robert Russell it was a free for all...state capture anarchy Sloppiness in their criminality Without a doubt...makes one sick to see where we have landed up.... and the scary thing is that we are going to land up with ANOTHER 5 years of ANC acceptance of this behavior.. normalized by the ANC We may end up with a coalition government He was debarred ..... goes to show who Zuma keeps as company now doesn't it ? Bring hulle in M'Lord @Dian ei coalition look what happened at P.E 
2:44:41,2:49:02, Attorneys cost money and with 3months salary it's not possible to litigate "vote ANC OUT At national level a coalition may work...we had a national coalition government before I doubt that the ANC will be completely out...too many diehard voters I don‚Äôt know where my X should I vote for The problem is most of the voters are not that much aware of what their beloved organization is doing. The ANC destroyed the country...future generations will judge us harshly "our children will be crossing borders in the near future to go and look for refuge Sad thing is...a lot of youth are believing in the EFF...another doomed party 
2:49:38,2:57:06, @ Magda nehü§£ü§£ü§£ We are in serious trouble. The DA need ethical guidelines...we never know what they are planning inhouse "Not judge ""us"". But those who perpetrated the unholy injustices pertaining to the state capture crime." True @Ben ....I was referring to the historical perspective In some countries the streets would have been full of dissent but we have become numb with trauma "ANC think we owe them "The ANC and EFF always blame colonialism This commission is at least giving some a chance to vent and relate their experiences.Judge Zondo's report will have to be concise and lead to arrests 
2:59:18,3:08:19, Still wonder who the new whistle-blower is. Can't wait for her day here Lyn Brown promised him another 5 year contract then fired him....disgusting "The promise was made on the Friday in London She was manipulated seriously. She has no moral compass "Stay at home That is the work of a shadow state to place stodges at strategic places so as to loot and enrich themselves and their cronies. These shenanigans haven‚Äôt stopped as a culture of living by friends the loot has taken over lives of Mzansi folks His contract was already over in any case 
3:08:59,3:16:20, @Michael it runs very deep at all levels in government They don't care about the so called ' our people'. Batho Pale my foot correct. this storyis very painful This guy was a CEO. He had no guts to stand up for himself and now come to the commission to complain that the was treated unfairly. It is so painful but the heartless ANC will deny they did anything wrong...just watch how arrogant they are in parliament @Planeless Pilot He took them to the CCMA They are pulling the wool out of the eyes of those who follow them. Taking advantage of the poor people who just believe what ever lies and promises for 25 years. 
3:16:32,3:22:42, The CCMA outcome was not favourable...it should have gone to the Labour court or even civil court Bad @Magda Seguin Planeless Pilot said he had no guts - and I responded with CCMA All these people need debriefing and counselling with reparations Planeless Pilot has no humanity or compassion "Nothing is likely to come from the ""me too"" call up. It's admirable. But there is just too much dragging us down. As a South African is it Planeless Pilot or Branless Pilot Brainless Piloot I think so too @Ben right now people are blaming Gordhan and the Eskom CEO for load shedding forgetting the huge damage Zuma and the Guptas did
