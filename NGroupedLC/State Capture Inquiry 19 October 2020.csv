I was once called Mr. Goldberg hmmm they were pressurised to reinstall gama by hook or crook "Mr. Myburg is on fire Zupta at work "Just say it was because of JZ "Zuma met his 3rd wife here qha ke andithi makuthini @Andre Gerber They cant Bro.

20:23,21:57, He's been evasive from the begining DCJ is not bothered by insults of ANC and EFF! kuyanyiwa today Yo abservation is spot on🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 "@Amen Eugen  Zondo #vuligate "imagine having a lying husband GM guys. Hope u all well Uwee Melusi Gigaba 
22:05,23:40, @Mbuso: He's been agreeing with the Commission throughout his testimony 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 "@Canis Africanis gm Morning Sal why does he keep rolling his eyes lol morning Sal overlooked intentionall or they were bought not to look into other charges @Mbuso: Yet another concession 😂😂😂 Thats no oversight. That was planned 
23:50,24:58, @Thando Cezula his right he's got a job to do he can't be distracted by side shows lies lies lies lies Malusi will send them a naughty video to show them what he thinks @Andre Gerber 🤣🤣🤣 It was definitely a deliberate oversight on instruction from Gigaba @keitumetse Mokgotsi😂😂😂 yes chair Valencia molo @Keitumetse Mokgosi It's called oversight 😇 
25:03,26:12, "@Andre Gerber Someone recently said that it is a ""very short"" video?" @thando molo stando I miss you still wearing the same tie and jacket !😂😂😂😂 la aaaa "@Pastor J.J  He has shifty eyes today 🙄🙄🙄 At what point do you just give up and admit to guilt? Some of these witness are just delaying the inevitable. @Andre Gerber hahahahahahaha 
26:15,27:47, Will Mr Gama be testifying? "@Donovan Landsberg gm that board Mr Mkwanzi you were part of. @Donovan at our expense off course. they don't have integrity. Gama was reinstated because he was a seally posterupedic from where certain people would enjoy doing what they wanted to do without a hassle @SanFran Arnold @Khanyi.AgeGracefully still? clever judge "@Yolo More Lady Y i see you Yolo 
28:03,28:53, Mkhwanazi is protecting himself @Yolo More Did you get that song?????????? I feel embarrassed for Mr Mkhwanazi and his lies at his age.😩😩😩 "Zondo's pace is so strategic @SanFran Arnold thankyou my love. @SanFran Arnold @Valencia J Maybe DCJ must just make a call and hand them over to the authorities to finish the job. @naledi are you here? Morning my dear colleagues. Please say a prayer for my very painful tooth and the dentist can only see me tomorrow. I am sure your posts will sooth me. Who is up to be fried today🛌 Mkhwanazi's actions speak louder to his guilt than his lies! He can lie all he wants but the evidence is there! 
29:12,30:40, "@Donovan Landsberg I think that being the second highest judge in the land that's a lie @Brandon kleinsmith oooh yes "@Heather there is a type of spice ""naeltjie"" The Zuma Zondo clash is going to be EPIC-ANOTHER RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE Can't believe what I am hearing from Mr Mkhwanazi. This gentleman was paraded previous as a well grounded Executive.I always held him up as a real top dog. I used to attend the same school as zondo @SanFran Arnold I can only imagine his frustration to having to tick all the boxes before acting. when he rolls his eyes his lawyers probly waving arms and shaking heads 
30:41,32:15, a bunch of liars and cheats hmmm see the board was pressurised by gigaba He was clever and i was little bit domm @Heather. We pray for the Almighty to give you you comfort 🙏 Khanyi ageGracefully Do see my chats @Elvis Malakoane yes ". . . in hindsight @Elvis i do my skat. rolling those eyes......a sign of lies 
32:27,33:16, Where did the get Myburgh? He's a pocket rocket! A dynamite in a small package! @Heather try Clove Oil available at a pharmacy yes you can fool people but it won't be forever. I don't know how former Pres Zuma can survive these hearings lady Yolo More are you well? "@Heather Durr gm Yolo more Goodmorning ND thanks Yolo and* @Elvis Malakoane I see you too 
33:21,35:19, :virtualhug: this guys face priceless @Elvis Malakoane gm my darling pastorjj Goodmorning pastorj thanks Sir Hi eyes! Why cant he concede on everything than being embarrassed like this "How these incompetent morons could have been appointed to Board level positions "I se a ""hindsight"" excuse coming" 
35:40,38:00, Mkhwananzi tell the truth! Set your soul free! @mboniseni mtuli my sentiments exactly @ Andre Gerber : Dont forget the I cannot remember/recall moments I am disgusted that Mr Mkhwanazi doesn't know the difference between a request and an instruction. He was INSTRUCTED to reinstate Mr Gama as a condition for him to be a Chair of Transnet. there is need to completely overhaul the process of appointing board members. clearly the likes of this old man and Tsotsi have no business seating on any board. @Gerard Victor that as well lying makes him look more stupid and lack backbone. "Mr. Mkhwanazi is only afraid of saying the instructions came from Zuma. Therefore Don't talk over the DCJ 
38:03,39:45, Lol@ hindsight thabo you right. and on point Hindsight and CRAFT must be the Modules they are trained on at Luthuli House before starting with duties. Igwala Mkhwanazi.....poor old man he is afraid to just say he was instructed to re-instate Gama.... yhuu and imenza doom lento cz ayihlangani tuu lento ayixelayo "@Andre Gerber​ its not easy he takes out the big guys Ayihlangani tu Wiseman! Ingxaki they never thought this day would come! huh. 😳 
39:48,41:18, I thought Malema would be waiting for him early this morning ". . . and on their CV they will be adding ""I survived Zondo""" Adv Myburgust ask him a direct question @Theo van Zijl lol "cANCer will say "" in Hindsight please reelect us again" "thando cezula you are right There is no way that a reasonable Board can ignore three Law Companies that come into the same conclusion that Gama has no reasonable prospects of winning against Transnet 😅😂😝🙋 Malema is still looking for somebody who wants to donate him their kahunas as he does not have big enough kahunas to appear before Zondo This guy will make a much better impression when he starts to speak the truth & stop trying to dodge the questions 
41:21,42:23, Zondo mist step down Otherwise Zumas is not commung I thought that JM has huge kahunas Avd Myburg should ask him if he was given a directive "Just need one of these skelms to throw Zuma under the bus-why protect that puppet and not yourself-he is a normal thief now Mfmm "Hi Theo @Mbuso Ndlovu He will step down for the tea break and be back after 15 minutes. Is that ok for you? they were looking for legal opinion that would suit their instructions. How many Legal opinions do you want??? 
42:44,43:52, commission is not for Zuma Mbuso Ndlovu is a troll. Zuma in a corner and can't turn @thando cezula sure @Mbuso... Why must your former classmate step down They wanted to change the outcome. "@Khanyi. AgeGracefully Sometimes I feel he is one of Zuma "And if he defies the commission "I'm loving this commission now 
43:57,45:20, @Pastor J.J 🤣🤣🤣 DCJ getting vexed now Galela chair! GALELA! Zuma must learn the Jerusalema dance Greetings fellow citizens Chair looks angry today Zondo iz on fire😆😆😆😆😆😆😆 Mkhwanazi was cornered to do what Gigaba wanted to reinstall gama klaar @togu madikane I'm loving it too 🤣🤣🤣🤣 
45:21,46:26, Chair is tired of this nonsense! He sees right through this crook! was gama a president @Samuel Skosana We all stopped counting Bro. hahahahahahahha @andre gerber 😂😂😂 So right Pastor the chair is onother person tody. The chair is sick and tired of lies "Edward ""taxi driver turned mining magnate"" Zuma @Pastor J J" Ya keep looking at the ceiling 
46:27,47:31, mkhwanazi is not answering the questions "Adv. Myburgh "let's close this case DCJ is paying his role very well. Looking after us the citizens @Soul Fire at least Zuma can count up to 4 steps thats all he need @Yolo More Edward is also know as 22/57. hehehehehe he make show he dont have direct answer commission is not targeting certain individuals but know who were the for front in state capture however some people failed to distinguish between request and instruction "I am sure some people when you mention Zondo 
47:33,48:40, "does not deny anything they all a bunch of crooks not one of our officials in government are honest They wanted to reinstate Gama hence they wanted a different legal advice... @Elvis Malakoane 🤣🤣🤣 and . .and . .and . .eeh. . .eeh . . eeh. thats when the brain gets an airlock is someone sitting up there where he is always looking or maybe his answers are in heaven? @Andre Gerber Lying is a sin bro. Remember Zooms starts counting from zero. Never heard him go to 2 Bro mkhwanazi must tell truth who was pushing the board behind??? scared of zuma @Theo van Zijl 😅😅😅 airlock lol 
49:00,49:57, @Pastor J.J 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 i don't know The question is WHY? Outside interference - JZ and the Gupta's law firm was perhaps bought did we start at nine tody?? yes Michael Michael """ Principles approach"" hahahahahahahahaha" thanks Anorld 
50:13,51:28, @Michael Michael always a pleasure "@Michael Michael DCJ requested early start today to ""finish off"" Mkwanazi." Principles 🤣🤣🤣 let me qualify that by lying some more eeeh...eeeh...eeeh..when he's lying...such embarrassment to Mkwanazi's family Mr Mkhwanazi seems to have worked for the State Capture to ensure reinstating Mr Gama. He could not take a principle position as he was bias towards serving his master. I remember one witness stated that the chair wanted at least someone come up with something that could help him to articulate the position of getting Gama back hope they finish him.and take his sizes. @Rendani aaah 
51:33,52:38, board wasted money so many different opinions wanted what they wanted to hear tell DCJ fire can the chairperson summarise for me what subjects he has dealt with since i was not aware that he was going to start before 10 w "Every time this man answers "everything is yes Is he looking up at the Angels to come down and save him ? "that is correct @Thami: this was has agreed with the Commission on almost everything Evidence leader tell him to go for orange overall fitting 
52:39,53:43, yes thats why eyes looking up @Pastor J.J whatever term you use it is the same difference He's made so many concessions its hard to keep up with all of them same here @nichol shange - taken by surprise with early start. Things are hotting up.. could be answer and stop this hhhhhhhhh 🙄🙄🙄🙄 why does he keep doing this @Donovan Landsberg Should I perhaps stop saying it? He's constantly looking up. Is it a matter of . . . I will lift up my eyes to the mountains; From where shall my help come? JOZI JOZI 👍👍 
53:59,55:44, |Sundowns are leacking their wounds🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 "Mafika Mkhwanazi You don't need this crap I'm your life Sir "@Theo van Zijl hahahahahahha. Or perhaps Zuma is up there doing his Rap version of ""Dancing on the Ceiling""" I your life** @Pastor J.J I agree its difficult to contain oneself with characters like this. Do they want him to admit that he was acting on the instructions of Zuma-He is not going to-They have a mountain of evidence . My cat just slapped me with her claws after I flicked her on her nose can see when they all rounded up for jail they turn state witnesses They were scared of Gigaba could question his motive / very disturbing such a waste of money Where is Rohan Barnard? 
55:45,57:20, Mkhwanazi adamant to support the losing team all those criminals must pay all the money back.by doing that many young people will get employment.and stop defending those criminals who put them on the street.95m.for 24 month.i trusted mr Nyanda . ' the long arm of the law' All cost borne by trasnet sies mann no wonder buggar all works in SA he take too long to answer full of bravado - this witness surely this man is willing to take the truth to his grave. he is very old to lie so passionately 🤔🤔 "He has already embarrassed himself. So 
57:37,59:20, Uh uNyanda these people are corrupt he must pay back the money...gama was puppet of politicians agree lebo He doesn't answer the questions directly whatever he says has no relevance to the question... Mkhwanazi is found wanting he is useless "Looking and listening to this guy he is useless this guy is useless Akemdala lotata for uxoka! 
59:23,1:00:18, strong word 😂😂😂😂 So Cele is finally being investigated but of course not by the corrupt police but by Zondo Commission.

Didn't JZ not have enough money to buy a suit to go to court in the early 2000's he had to borrow money for rent etc. Now Nkandla's bunker is full of money "In terms of the instructions of Guptas Lucky he didn't kill me. it was long ago before all this.... I thought he would return a bit tougher today and deny all but nope Misconducts of not follow the board’s resolution 😀😀 Mr Mkhwanazi is a very brilliant man but badly used by greedy ppl

Settle Agreement doesn't even know how to explain Comedy hour ft Mr Mkhwanazi when he was chairman of the board Molefe was CEO and Singh was CFO "when chair says your name twice in that tone Agreeing to everything "After this testimony in hindsight chair DCJ is loosing it with this lier By the way what was Mosebenzi Zwane's word when he was testifying? This one is in hindsight 
3:28:27,3:29:37, Daily Show featuring Mr Mkhwanazi Mkhwanazi is a liar shame. shoooo @Blake Yogi right??? If I was younger I would've gotten a hiding! Myburgh why the heck did you go there "Come boys "David @Pastor J.J Ha ha. More likely an ambulance.

3:30:29,3:31:37, @ D. Zondo. I agree with you . He looks so kind and was used shem Hi @Khanyi. AgeGracefully Such a pity that our Black talent in SA has been found wanting in the scale. Most have been compromised through their greed appetite. They allowed to be used "Ex Min mus be watching- saying Not True. "" I cannot interfere with the Board's decision" "@Zama: ""As I'm sitting here...""" "As I sit here chair Paul... i suspect so too "Someone tell Mr Mkhwanazi that it's okay to say Ýah I did it

3:33:38,3:34:02, "@Khanyi. AgeGracefully he was not some victim DCJ is very moderate in his questioning. Mr Mkhwanazi was not interested in reports that were written by his predecessor’s lawyers and moreover he wrongly applied the race card to Siyabonga’s case. cant wait for ACE and BHEKI. Maybe if you can get Shabir Shaik off the golf course for long enough as well. AFU must do the things and get the pots uyawabona nje namehlo ngamehlo wesela I am being generous Valencia Mr Mkhwanazi X10 @Gift I see the shiny tiles and I hear the echo I am stunned.
