2:11:28,2:14:36, What is he here to testify about vele? I think they are going to deal with how Guptas infiltrated security aparatus and how they warned the President take wat he says with pinch of salt. absolutly wrongly accused bulelani nguka that he was a spy..part of zumas cronies..did it to protect zuma cassim suleman I think he has axe to grind he will give the light cassim he actually was very central to Bulelani story with Mac Mha "When these arms were ""transformed"" in the 2000s the budget of the secret service are never know eccept the president 
2:14:43,2:17:44, maharaj yes and ranjeni munsamy..who pushed article lol yes and she is also I'm trouble zondo shpuld ask him about nguka episode why chairperson look tired? it might come out it should bulelanis wife was high up in anc ..wanted to oust her also..was mandela nominee..anti zuma but again it will be classified information unless it is redacted 
2:17:55,2:20:39, it will be difficult to ask him cos it is not in his terms of reference this man he here to clerified how the mis but that would be interesting this guy very very veryclose to zuma they even have the same hairstyle its part of state capture 2960 days shabir shaik ..out of prison..together with doctors ended on parole they worked very close before the Guptas and they split but Zuma must be worried zuma did not give shabir pardon...think split there 
2:21:42,2:25:02, it came via zuma to the minister after the sudden onslaught of the terminal illness @redriger ...They were in a race to see who was the worst or bigger skelm @redriger I wonder how many trees had to die for this commission this will come out but this guy is well protected salt saying one thing and doing opposite precily like all corrupt politicians yuk i spel like a portugese today sorry my portugese brothers 
2:25:11,2:29:18, "@redriger The 3 Shaik brothers make the Gupta""s look like amateurs" wat a load of bs... the bs should be in caps All in the same boat . One of a kind "body parts say a lot about spy @Danie Nilsen..lol absolutly he can pick up speech like a radar this is goin nowhere...smokescreen..and zondo..losing the plot @Danie Nilsen ...His eras look like satellite dishes. 
2:29:23,2:33:38, ears but to his credit..was detained/..6months solitary confinement..so may have lost his mind there @Pastor J he was and still is on the Radar and apartheid security branch guys were devils..cruel i did 40 days in sc and 6 months is unthinkable "his eras or ears he had ants and cokroaches as company..used to talk to them.. i started as as a souty but due to the high divorce rate in sa i became a boertjie later on i got my first one 1997 a 5210 nokia big as a brick lol 
2:34:30,2:39:11, after the 2nd week you give them names ha ha @redriger I had my 1st one in 1995. a Orbitel the size of an hollow block @redriger @Danie Nilsen ....Before that we had the Motorola and Alcatel radios and pagers. you even called yourselves in other peoples converation just on ring ha ha google o malley archives..for more onmo shaikh ja i had i pager and then had to get to a telkom phone booth you did not use house phones then yes know what u talking about Danie @Elvis Malakoane as it was then it is still know but new names and departments new players dirty game 
2:42:24,2:47:53, and then this minister reports to whom mickey mouse @Danie Nilsen @redriger ...Another piece of interesting info. Telkom is an offshoot of the SA Post and Telecommunications as it was know in the later days. @Pastor J correct "so this people are making a commission a library when you hear a double click after picking up the phone just talk bullshit lol "that is why some ""people: were so bad he went on the ""voete was"" operation" i hope he is geniune it this endevour he is making them look forward to the trip 
2:48:07,2:55:42, lol back to back he is the no1 resposable "the oversight you get training to remember to keep on lying and end always ""it was not me""" lol he will say it was not me This shows that our country was captured to an extended that people were just miss used When is Malema appearing for his stolen VBS fund hopefully before he buys a corrola @Danie Nilsen Too late he already paid for 2 houses and a land rover u mean Toyota Watson 
2:56:21,3:03:57, yes sorry my mistake ha ha "xenophobia minister But Malema is robbing everybody blind he is money maker i think even this red uniforms he makes big money from the manufacturer Shivambo is busy to take him out he knows too much aka VBS and is not happy that they were caught with thier paws in the cooky jar n moerse klomp voet wassers at home he got double crossed retired mo lies in many tongues. 
3:04:35,3:09:21, listen how he stays away from dropping xumas name zumas name his lies sre convincing he is like a second hand car dealer He sells you the history of the car not its future ohh he's a pure waist of time. üòê The last time I saw this smooth talker is back when him and Maharaj accused Bulelani Ngcuka of being a spy. He was believable then until Semenya tore him apart. a buy as it's told car. not a buy as you tested car. pheladi Lamola I don't really believe him because that is were our problems started crooks making it looking all legal no mention of when zuma chaged it all like the new hit sqaud and pay out to so called informers and the payment of socalled fronts for covert ops 
3:09:39,3:13:22, This guy is so shady he would disappear under a tree in the sun he doess not throw a shadow standing in the sun hahahaha who is this? all i said so it is mo shabir shaiks bro Can we proceed now what? so many seats for what? 
3:13:40,3:16:16, Is this Shabir Shaik's brother who was implicated along with Zuma? yes He doesn't age at all.
