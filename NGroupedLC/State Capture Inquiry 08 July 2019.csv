time,-35:30,message who is on the hot seat today? Ambassador Bruce koloane are they starting at nine or ten According to the website they'll start at 10 They must declare a national holiday when Zuma appears before the commission! I Agree Yin Yang! It‚Äôs gonna be a chaos on 25 July with all Zuma bussed-in supporters making noise and blocking roads outside the venue My favourite food to eat while I watch this mess unfold is biltong and avo.....no popcorn! 
-34:06,-1:16, @MJ Odendaal Jorgensen On crispy toast and some salty bacon just forkicks. My all time favourite "Pastor J Why can‚Äôt this court do a full days productive business "@Yin Yang @Maxwell Sibiya .You are spot on and indeed very right. Sadly everyone that has come to testify before him seem to tell the truth about him whilst he will chose to deny it all. My mind was just refreshed that Mac Maharaj who was Presidency spokesperson at the time of the Gupta landing denied that Zuma gave the orders for the plane to land Proceedings starting at 10:00 waiting.... Why are they late 
-0:45,4:25, "unless those found guilty of corruption have actual written or documented evidence that Zuma instructed them to implement state capture yes he must mention names "remember today should be interesting i thought he would rattled by hoffmeyer How many times has judge zondo have to correct madam useless nope mathyila kolwane hopefully after tea SA ambassador to US this 1 I don't think they could be so brave to go public without evidence 
4:49,7:59, he represents SA in the UN security council Mr Matjila is making a correction on Monyela clyson ?????? Magda?????? "Those who steal are also perfect liars Thieving will never stop ! Corruption will never stop ! Never "@goolamv must be Embarrassordor for SA and Zuma JUst learnt a new word thanls Magda DDGbMahoai was not there 
8:05,10:28, morning coligs "WoW! changing his testimony on who was present at a meeting It's seems as if you guys didn't plan about the program before proceedings why so many corrections...... Typing errors... YES tell us Mr Liar ! the type still learning @ACE MABEKA because he listened to the other witnesses hope judge luring him into comfort zone then smacks him later!!! 
11:13,16:03, not knowing present tents and past tense or He was Head of Protocol Yes he is a Zuma acolytes why else did he get an ambassodorship after the Gupta crisis He must have contacts in India...plot is thickening shut up!! and listen before judging Listening is also a skill @Mr Q well said "The uncouth Mr Q is here again Listen to your hearts content to lies 
16:26,17:57, Its custom to be ill mannered Magda pls guy's keep low profile n listen to dis guy..

SA ambassador to US This guy represent SA in United Nations now. ha ha but everything is now broken 
18:04,19:47, and stealing and lying why doesn't he add that ! context of all this narrative? " @Magda Seguin absolutely Hello to all here Protected by his struggle credentials @Magda Seguin. He thinks they will work for him here. Ambassiders earn R1.4 m plus the same amount in perks I thought they are bringing that man who was was rewarded for assisting the Gupta's to lend @ waterkloof He's explaining a lot of things that has nothing to do with the question . . . verbal Diarrhea 
19:53,21:30, üí§üí§ANC experts on envelopes üíµüí∂üí∏ What is he talking now ! is this a bio on himself ? His entire CV related verbally inkinga niphawula ngeasilungu..I jst wanted to let you know something..you know white monopoly is always blamed bcoz they own everything here They earn more than that when you incl their non taxable allowances @ Magda Seguin. Those allowances can go up to double their basic package. This man actually got a promotion He is full f his own importance @Luvuyo Zantsi .... as is Malema divorced from reality whos is this chep 
21:41,23:39, The DCJ is patient He's not learned the strategy to answering questions or accountability. He thinks that it's a matter of bullsh#t baffles brains "Ag nee man The waterproof Gupta plane landing @lufuno Justice Ramashia "he is no longer President !! its former president ""Butternut""" Tjo.... "As if we dont know this information is giving sound unnecessary please Ok why do we need to know this ? 
23:51,26:38, This guy is just giving a long rigmarole and not even giving a chance for the chair to interject or pose question. You can tell he is trying to sweet talk himself to innocence. It's all above his VIP status *about Tweet like Zindzi and spread hate this is completely irrational and irrelevant ... you can be a rocket scientist and b√® who is this guy on the stand please?

32:03,34:43, "@Thando Nkutha "Aske this ANC envelop guy how SA on the UN end-up signed with THE coalition of demons to go destroy Libya Exactly @Ibo Thabo @Ashne Hesselberg I think he's explaining how Koloane became ambassador 40 minutes of nothing "So this guy is not Koloane He is Stop manipulating the volume SABC @ Reinette Raubenheimer it is Jerry Matjila who testify 
34:46,36:41, verbal diarrhoea Jerry Matjila Jerry Matjila is his name thanks @Phindile mbonani he is Jerry Matjila who is the current ambassador to the United Nations and was the DG during the landing of the Gupta plane. day of Matjila's @Yose Human I hate capitalism - it's a system for sociopaths. I rest my case. Zuma is a thief period.It has nothing to do with capitalism 
36:43,38:35, I also thought Kholoane was to testify today. What is Matjila's role or position back then in the Gupta landing gate? @ Busang Tsotetsi Tsotetsi his full names is Jerry Matthews Matjila agreed...capitalism sucks He's a story teller. let's get on the business of the day. Guptas landing aircraft in our military base. Thanks for the info @PATRICK MANGI "those who experience low volumes Why dont they address him on his name like any other witness "I like this guy "@Yose Human So in your opinion 
39:21,42:36, @Yin Yang Sounds like a kindergarten argument. This is a waste of tax payers money. how come we fly two ambassadors home just to answer one question. we can just bring koloane to table to answer who gave him thumbs up for the landing @Yin Yang I'm not looking at just SA but the entire planet. @Yin Yang Like Is said - juvenile. has this madala dyed his hair? Life if luxury...on taxpayers tab They travel in and out the country all the time @peter port. Even their wives are doing same. @peter pott @Yose Human Zuma is thief period. 
43:13,46:27, This man must go teach this to international relations students. How did he allow Guptas at our army base. Zuma enjoyed trips to Russia for bribes for Atomic power plants üí∞üí∞üí∞ It‚Äôs not him who allowed that @Zila Pinda. That one is next. "if we question landing @Zola Pinda "Let him carry on with verbal diarrhea... wait for Cross Xm This man knows how to lie he is talking nonsense. airforce 1 landed at AFB waterkloof "This is still a warm up 
46:29,48:15, Where is Kate I miss her @goolamv LOL He went to zuma school of lying and denials. "There is no customs and excise at Wsterkloof no one new about it but the air force did not shoot the aircraft out the sky because it entered band airspace. So all this guys knew from the media that Gs have landed @Shweta kitchen healthy and tasty cooking Hello Shweta "Magda "@magda 
48:49,50:09, Just imagine what other things left SA without been noticed. "It‚Äôs also regarded as port of Entry "Mo there isn't for 300 customers going through SABC is your man babalassed SABC fix your sound "..What are the implications or security breach that could have been @Yose Human Why are you so concerned about Zuma? "all the Gupta did 
51:21,53:55, so the principal has to agree first. So Zuma knew about this and he agree. There's no shadow of doubt that Guptas did loot . @Yose Human Yeah Just Like your Uncle Zuma @Kisten Moonsamy .Did you probably work at Standard Bank at some stage? Floyd the same question u ask Yose I ask him last wik.he or she never respond.i will be glad if he answers u.bcz I dont think he or she is a fool. He speaks hypothetically but not what happened "We are getting closer to Private Visit ladies and gentlemen. we have been spending too much time on wrong three. we got men and women who are watching our skies as we watching this. permission is sort to enter SA skies.

In that PIC commission the big fish Dan Matshila is being grilled No doubt that it was a private visit whether there were sate ministers or not because there could have been prior knowledge that there are officials from India so no police escort was cleared too. so all the vehicles used was wrong too. @Thando Nkutha Are you sure about that? Short tea break I see that Iqbal Surveys newspapers are spreading fake news about the SARS Commissioner...he and his Ayo newspapers are also Zuptoids THIS sorricaps person with the nice hair do has a very high standing of himself but it seems he failed his brief as head of dirco

1:57:18,1:59:32, This racist narrative about 'whites' in SA being behind evil deeds in a democratic SA where the ANC rule must really stop.It is the populist rhetoric of the ANC/EFF/BLF divide and rule tactics if yu did something fo zuma and found to have been guilty yu wud be sent somewhere else STOP blaming whites we had 25 years of theft but is in denial therefore there is so much self hate FF+ have good policies for all and may actually be good for SA. "@I Am Free I agree with you. Why can't we spend on machinery that can refine for instance @MegaDizzyk. I don't blame you for that comment. you are enjoying priviledges which were stolen from us the majority. Yhooo @Michael Wild.

2:01:08,2:02:11, Apartheid had 48 years of existence.... the ANC has had more than half of that in power.... and where are we now? there is 23 years left to blame the whites... then what? @Magda Seguin looks like he is Magda "I this "To remain sustainable "This man talks like a super Star.

Titles dont give you integrity and morals He reminds me of Bernin Ntlemeza when he appointed to the Hawks 
2:02:14,2:03:37, He sound very conceited and arrogant @Thando Nkutha i wanna hear that too so he allowed the guptas to do as they pleased Mishap!!!

2:06:23,2:10:07, I think judge zondo played with this diplomatic guy in the last question by the saying my question I thought to ask but now I change & reserve it for someone else and then asked the Q @Living with supercars - Porsche & Ferrari. we freely owned our land and mineral resources. The disturbance came with thiefs who wanted what we had. the guy is full of himself @Moshoeu Mabusela talks about privileges that were stolen by white ppl when they got here but cannot tell us what privileges they had before whites got here. LOL! These are the people that abstain in the UN security council when human rights abuses are voted on...the Rohingya comes to mind JZ loves the spotlight. His lawyers advised him not to come here and he goes against that advice @Danie Nielsen. He will not miss an opportunity to school everyone about what the State Capture is.
