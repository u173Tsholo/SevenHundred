"Pastors are corrupt Do we really have an Honest Political Party and/or Politician? Not too many by the look of things 
1:03:39,1:07:27, Now this witness voice is getting away humble to lie i "@Bedazzled DA & EFF have no policies except to insult the ANC Just dismantling the power like they have done in taking over the metros he's to young to be the main guy just a fall guy "@Josias Maluleke thats their major drawback Judge Zondo is showing that this man was not fit to do his job. no hang on there's more money to steal Please name one anc policy that they have implemented and change the lifestyle of black people 
1:08:10,1:11:53, dololo spot on cele our people must stop to vote this useless corrupt anc @david celle. It‚Äôs the law. they wil never stop voting for anc "I am voting anc next time Yes we will not stop voting ANC . We need the daily entertainment!!! ANC people vote for the anc and then strike and set everything alight and destroy infrustructure and then again vote for anc. The ANC really run this country to the ground with incompetent thieves 
1:11:57,1:15:18, "@Carnoth Ngomane They simply do not have anything to say about the country's issues hence the insults the anc was once a glorious movement just greed anc does a better job than apartheid...viva anc i support your view cele this inquiry waste time and taxpayers money as nothing will happen to those who are exposed by the inquiry what is better "Onkabetse "Insulting my parents won't assist you with anything wena David Cele  yes i agree @David cele you sound like ben10 now I guess you were born in this democracy so you don‚Äôt understand

"Valence Watson says Agrizzi is a pathological liar @Josias Maluleke At least they are not as corrupt as the ANC - the ANC has perfected corruption. Everything else they touch turns to s**t. agreed @makhosi nobhatyi . How does a camera lie ? "You are right David @Blaze 613 Then you're a fool - just like all the other ANC voters. 
1:26:38,1:29:40, The Watsons were never on the side of black people..they became rich by stealing from the poorest of the poor hi brother's and sisters that's struggling in South Africa anc supporters don't want to see the truth News today ‚Äî Only 6% have a passmark of over 60% at mathematics in SA universities. What chance SA future in worldwide economy "@Derek Main not holding fort for any political party all I say is opposition parties must come up with progressive "In this and other commissions cANCer policy in schools are PASS ONE PASS ALL... "People are advised not to vote for the ANC with reasons @Josias Maluleke How many party manifestoes have you looked at? 
1:29:57,1:33:05, ....Naledzani Mashau‚Äã...That is the fact of outside governance the president. His venue is instructed from Europe. @Cerebis indeed its all about ANC anc supporters are being told that apartheid wil come back so wrong "@Josias Maluleke Besides South Africa has a mental health problem. It's not a crime problem. @carnoth ngomane UDM - Holomisa has shown time and again in parliament that he is the voice of reason. There I've done it. Apartheid will never come back...to me it is dead..I dont socialize with people who believe in any form of apartheid "@Derek Main Agree @Raven Penny That's just yet another ANC BS story. 
1:33:26,1:36:23, @Derek Main Your statement makes a lot of sense. However they got it very wrong in NMB @Cerebis I agree with you. Not sure what other factors are at play there but Bobani is very suspect. Apartheid. lawd like affirmative action and black economic empowerment is clear signs of apartheid. Apartheid is Economically. True or False? Then that is anc apartheid.. who are the people looting "@Derek Main Thanks you who are the mentally disabled? "Incompetence play a big role  
1:36:30,1:38:59, "@carnoth ngomane Exactly. And let me just say SABC.....Will Cloudy come? food parcels at the service The black people that do get degrees do get jobs.... just not in South Africa How many people must die for this Commission @Josias Maluleke Surely those people should have realised by now that the ANC makes many promises but doesn't keep them? who wants a war in South Africa? @Derek Main Ethnicity & populism play a huge role in our election and the will make it hard to oust the ANC The cANCer will struggle for the next 300 years..they dont have the ability to move on
