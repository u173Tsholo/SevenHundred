time,35:51,message 10:12 i love u granny "Trasnet was one of the parastatal used as an ATM by these corrupt scavengers. Hawks must start arresting people lets leave ATM out of this What a handsome witness Looks like the actor.. Val Kilmer mhmm he is doable!!! he looks nervous 
35:58,1:13:59, He is married.. unfortunately do me! do me! "Ladies 😀😀😀 we are just observing thats all :) nohing wrong with window shoppy just eat at home ;) What is this witnesses name? #Lucy Lucy : The person is Gerhard van der Westhuizen; former Transnet employee Thank-you Thelsa 👍 Precious Ntshangase he definitely does😍😍 
1:18:57,1:29:58, @Thando Nkutha embarks on a drug-fuelled dream scene or maybe he had KFC over the weekend. Now he's got upset stomach. Gordhan is both capable and honest - like a magical unicorn in the ANC "I feel said about what is been published by PP findings "@Thando Nkutha what he did for pillay has been done *thousands* of times before in the public service. he also obtained legal advice on the matter why you so adamant to ignore the facts? "this matter is 10 years old "@ Thando Nkutha this is political motivated surely she wear big shoes so I doubt she will win this one on court "no matter how we feel about this useless PP the fact is her remedial action is binding unless challenged in ciurt! Busisiwe will be embarrassed again 
1:30:26,1:39:40, "@Granny Mokwena and gordhan will ask for a personal costs order "All those whom steal money must account @Thando Nkutha what has education got to do with it> "@Thando Nkutha dearie Paraffin Gordhan stated it categorically that he's instituting legal practitioners to oppose the recomendation by the PP "@Thando Nkutha I think you had it wrong Brian Molefe is a strong contender for state capture King "More likely scenario: PP acting on orders from cockroach-in-charge There are a lot of people from the ruling party who wants to see Paraffin out of the organization and out of Ramaposer's cabinet 
1:40:37,1:50:05, @Thando Nkutha oh ffs. you sound like something from star wars. @ Thando Nkutha who employed Pillay? Isn’t commission itself after being appointed ? Gordhan's issue is an administrative one. Intent is important. There is enough information in the public domain to support Pravin Gordhan. The PP is going to have a fight on her hands. TK please do your research. This is an old story. "I am not saying Gordhan is not guilty or not but worries me they she published this was in a hurry without giving his side to read "PP is to investigate the matters not older than 3 years so we will follow this until the end "In the matter of the PP and PG Ok send me your e mail address and I will forward the information to you. I dont have to argue. There is affidavits and evidence which sadly the PP chose to ignore. You have right to believe @ Thando Nkutha I am concerned about corruption and I am against it. let us wait until this reaches courts and court will decide 
1:51:35,1:58:37, I agree. Let us wait and see the demise of the PP. Not many legal minds support her at the moment. PP timing is very suspect in my view. Ignored inputs on 21 and 22 May to get out report just be CR17 can announce his cabinet. Last kicks of a dying horse I think. @ Thando Nkutha the man didn’t steal money so let us start there commissioner went to treasury for approval "I don’t want president to include Gordhan with this cabinet for temporary until he sort out this when he reshuffle cabinet he can come back TN you don't know. I say to you the NPA withdrew charges. The Nugent inquiry has made a finding which has not been challenged. Legal opinions in the public domain and most important of all process was followed. This exculpatory opinion was only found and released after the acting commissioner went through the now fired commissioner's docs. How the mighty have fallen!! Ask Tom. He could have cleared up this mess at the Nugent Commission. He ducked...and dived... 
1:59:26,2:09:01, YES! Agreed TN he did qualiify. He was 56 at that time. Early retirement was valid. The topping up was the concern for which Gordhan sort advice. "There was a reason why Shaun Abrahams did not prosecute because there was no possibility of prosecution As strange as it may sound. This I understand was common practice in the public sector. Custom and Practice I think its called. "This report 2 will be overturned @Thando Nkutha he broke no law! I'm friends with many people who work for me. Am I automatically corrupt if any agreement is made between us that benefits them? TN I think you are getting it wrong. I was a Zuma supporter in the early days when I thought he cared for the poor. Now I know differently. We must do a balancing act and be objective. "@Thando Nkutha nope 
2:09:53,2:27:17, no it's not. corruption is corruption I think we are on the same page but looking from a different angle. this commission is just a destruction for blacks to loot in the background @Thando Nkutha it would be if it happened - but it didn't. so this is a copy and past contest ? TN. IF NDPPs did not delay the Zuma case...…... "@Thando Nkutha he responded illegally... Bring back Agrizzi 
2:27:25,2:37:35, Lots of it has already been unpacked. A pity I cannot share all the stuff that I have followed over the years. This story is not new to me. @Thando Nkutha he requested clarification of the legal grounds by which she was making what he considered an illegal demand. Which she didn't provide. The courts will give her a bloody nose for it. I dont think it is that simple. You see Gordhan is very astute in that he knows due processes and he made sure he followed the prescripts. Thats where he has protected himself I feel legally the courts will be hard pressed to find against him. "@Thando Nkutha if she wants to investigate a case more than two years old then she has to provide the special circumstances under which she is acting. Law is law TN Zumas instance is different. He has appeared in court a number of times and to the best of my knowledge he has a 100 % losing record. The lawyers are chowing his money. an advocate should know how to operate within the law "as mentioned @Thando Nkutha FFS I'm referring to the PP act. Nothing to do with state capture inquiry
