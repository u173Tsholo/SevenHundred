5:13,12:35, ESKOM says Loadshedding level 4 from 3pm What's happening here? "@bongile sango Yip - checked their Twitter account - they will make statement later "The @Duduzane_Zuma account was originally called “Bantukazi Biko” "Eskom regrets to announce that loadshedding will move from Stage 2 to stage 4 at 15:00 until 22:00 tonight what is really happening in these state owned companies. Eskom is getting worse by a day.🤔 John moodey DA executive member in Gauteng has left the party I wonder if they got the generator there for this loadshedding. Angelo Agrizzi's former PA confirms sending birthday hampers to Nomvula Mokonyane and assistant

When did she appear again. Cheek that she is trying to even fob Zondo off 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ Collective responsibility of executives binds all of them. That is what their signatures mean I think. 
20:35,21:55, I don’t think she would come back here she will submit dr certificate I suspect that they is sabotage within the Eskom just after NEC ngiyasho nje Sadly there are only ca 2400 viewers. We need to get this information to the rest of the 60M citizens @Sbusiso she has no corner to izinqe zisobala Surely budget reprioritisation needs to be signed off by the CFO????? "what position this woman hold @Phakamile I fully agree with you Has this crook been charged for fraud or its only Thabethe @Rahab Takalo Chief Financial Officer 
22:18,24:50, R342 million 😲😲😲😲😲 yes @abongile @Phakimile Khuzwayo you maybe correct coz Zuma ppl still within the Eskom Rahab and DDG. She holds 2 positions in govt "Hofmeyer's stream is SAA  @Yolo More You're correct - thanks ! "SA had money this is really shameful "ANC MUST GO PERIOD 
25:04,26:45, They all come here and tell tales but not answer questions Its there but it doesn't say what she says it says😜 "we agree @mabatho they must just go like yesterday "people steal so much "@Valencia J @Mmabatho Phuthi agrees but the question is which party can rescue us frm this mess And we had so much potential. Tragic What these ANC looters have done to use all... "@rahab all of them 
26:58,28:15, ANC has wasted so so so much of states money Herman mashaba's new party Action SA Abel none Action SA ANC South Africa ok cool "instead of yes or no South Africa should be led by people who are willing to make change "If we can vote ANC out all these crooks will be out enough "In order to vote the ANC out 
28:16,29:16, :shelterin: I think Mashabas is better than the rest @thando yes hubby ActionSA I laughed as the chair asked if the figures arein Mills ANC wasted lot of money Action SA. "@Serepa Le Mabona Wow after more than 20 years you still believe the ANC will do it I still believe we also need to get rid of so many political parties "@Elaine I agree with you 
29:21,30:28, "their members are suspended with full pay "I want maimane to start his own party we need direct elections "the problem is not to found Anc out. the question we have is I vouch for Mashaba's party "We don't need political parties anymore. We need to vote for the individuals we want in positions. From MEC's can we close down this country for two months and see if we can still have this people again elections are too far away "There’s actually no party that can substitute ANC people 
30:30,32:56, @sammy I agree No @kholofelo ANC all of them need to go period Mashaba has integrity and he is honest. We are tired of these crooks adv.gcabashe can hold her own.i wonder where dd they get notshe Now she is being nailed @fieliesSA he is such a talented politician and we can't really let that wisdom go to waste They must pay back the money and go wear orange overalls. Different sizes waiting for them This woman was appointed for looting purposes... the problem poor south africans were feed that grants are only provided by Anc and if they vote the other way around there will be no more grants. that's the real problem I have been hearing 
32:57,34:20, "@ Mmabathu Mphuthi De De De De De... "@Thabiso mngadi This one didn't do her job period FS govt is rottd2 @Abel Matshidiso Agree! Any of the looters arrested today ? some from UIF suspended Her strategy is to confuse both judge and evidence leader so that they have no idea what the finance rules are.

Naledi Barron he is quiet today you can tell by the way she blinks every after 3sec that she's a pathological liar What happened to all the cows? they must bring back gerie nel to represent the state 
37:32,38:40, Most were never bought those that were starved to death @Elvis Malakoane Yes he is. A blinking liar ☺ @thabiso we need Gerlie Nel during prosecution answer the question!!!!!!! this lady is lying yes thts what i meant who is the witness? She's thumbsucking 
38:42,40:22, Advocate Gcabashe is stalking her. She's going for the kill:yougotthis: Ms Dlamini its so sad what politicians can do to enrich themselves & friends. egg or chick first.... allocate budget before feasibility study gets conducted... ya neh please answer the Question madam yessssss advocate you bring gerrie nel they will bring racism "Ahh "It looks like we are only short of two testimonies which will only happen through summons 
40:32,42:33, How can you approve a project without knowing if you can afford it or not and just depend on a shady virement rule This whole project was just for crooks to loot. This is a crook! miss Dlamini stop playing us please🙄 "we need to be educated it was properly looted yess "In the 80s & 90s zondo is huffing and puffing in disbelief he banna this woman 😳 
42:33,43:50, the first year no caoex Zondo is fed up with the running around Where is the HOD now? @Naledi Barron Very true. This Astina company had no money. "Discounted cash flow he wena..sit up straight this is serious business ANd only AFTER this can the Proposer put forward a final project costing budget which would include the cost of those studies. i.e. recoup its initial upfront cot for the studies!! "Wonga Mniki This is complete madness indeed 
43:51,44:31, if they would have started with the feasibility study from the first place it would have indicated that they can't afford it Is the lady a CA? Does anyone know? who was the hod if i may ask whyis she sitting sideways lake that?? She has a Bcom "@Wonga @Cerebis Yup! A shell company from the start! @wayne joseph she has a Bcom. shes not a CA this crook is lying. where is the money she's talking about. 
44:32,44:54, Thabethe was the HOD Thabethe first year no capex budget - found irregular - it is a multi year project so she had to make a plan she knows her area of work CA = Crooked Accountant🤣🤣 @wayne joseph .....The CFO @wanye she never finished her CA test ok thanks she needs a beer Yes she's CA = Complicit Agent 
44:55,45:49, "Maphuthi calling people to vote another party no problem but you need to convince me WHAT IS THAT  If Bcom then problem @wayne joseph Bcom and some dip from a place in Canada I think that the problem is complacency more than incompetence. This lady is highly qualified but she chose to think with her stomach. If she had applied integrity she would be out of a job. @Masuku: LOL LOL LOL feasibility studies is just the wording...... Wow this lady is embarrassing now. How do you approve millions without receiving the plan. so if there was a map why was it not followed maybe a ethical dillema? 
45:49,46:39, She is not competent "There is poverty all over It look like the whole Free state cabinet was there back then is going to jail or pay back the money CA = Crooked Accountant LOL LOL Univ of Turfloop Lord help us All😑 dlamini is unethical delinquent accountant Need to prove if she is just incompetent or if she is corrupt

The lady knows pfma but she fails to just concede that astina project was forced by Zwane and Ace I agree with you @Elvis SO THESE PEOPLE RUN THIS COUNTRY INTO THERE POCKETS DAYLIGHT 
48:56,50:18, Mr Thabete don't want to hear that Maphuthi let's also look into John Moodeys resignation and the comments leading to his resignation with Enca anchor if you listened to his interview this morning @Vuyo Sono That gloss is from a Herman's Black Like Me product who was paying?
