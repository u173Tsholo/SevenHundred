28:01,30:51, YOH GUYS the lady was deep withing the ANC right @Thando Nkutha...

30:53,32:36, @patrick mukatshelwa. None. "If I was Miss Barbara she's a strong woman. Some whites also fought vele "@Lindokuhle Mnisi. And she was privilege to be in her own cell strong indeed Let’s vote them out then comrades Yet she was fighting apartheid. "People of all races

37:57,40:20, Mr katz is president CR personal advocate. hmmm! @Thando Nkuta have you ever spent 7 years by your self in a small confined space. Stop dismissing people pain chief just listen true He is so ungrateful I thought when Cyrial Ramaphosa took over he would clean up all these rotten cabinet of Zuma and appoint his own cabinet. He still working with all that rotten cabinet. Cyril is inteligent. after elections he will remove all that rot thanks matji i miss some text message its not easy to remove someone from his position unless due process have been followed. "masilela! he was the deputy president in this ""rotten cabinet"". meaning he must excuse himself too following your reasoning" 
40:22,47:23, also reduce cabinet size.. its intelligence in politics @Mr Q. lets hope so. @peter pott. Eishhh tricky on that one. but what is stopping him now @Mr Q He wants them to campaign for him for the 2019 general elections Barbara now speaks like she at the bar. Hope for meaningful testimony Hogan. Here is just one question: was the lives of black people improved during the turn of Barbara Hogan as a public enterprise minister? yes/no black out ~ 
47:31,52:08, Yes.. SAA was making profits back then 😂😂😂 Mr Q. which year? back then cannot be the answer "Today 😂😂😂😂😂 Mr Q which year was SAA making profits and how much profit did it make . Please support your statement.... Maria Ramos white capturer of note "@peter pott 2011 was the last time SAA made an operating profit "Dude. that was not profit. We sold our fleet 
52:33,56:18, I sense trouble in this commission today😞 morningsssss. just got here whatever Hogan says the zuma people will say nothing implicates him.trust me So ? "@peter post go check your facts Coleman was part of SAA in 2001 "Dube. Here she is out of her own mouth kubi @peter pott do you understand the concept of going concern? 
56:53,1:02:19, Dube. don't attempt to be her spokesperson. this are comrades fighting their own personal battles in the public gallery. How Zuma treated kathrada is on the table here @peter pott Im not her spokesperson you choosing to quote lies for no reason Andrew coleman chief!!! Dudu Myeni tried to throw around that lie @Thando Nkuta chief google the financial statements dude sadly is that we don't own majority of the planes we see at our airports. We are leasing them. for how much ? She was not allowed to share a cell with blacks. @peter post its not sad the business model of airlines now requires them to lease aircraft. That way they able to use the best aircraft every 2-3 years without sinking millions. the question is why the apartheid regime did not want her to mix with blacks "Hence called ""Apartheid""" 
1:02:24,1:06:46, being white does not mean you are better but its just a skin colour dube. You got to be kidding me. model of airlines?really @peter post you can challenge the cost of the leases and whether they are favourable to SAA. But the concept of leasing is standard in the industry. why white privilege in a country with black majority Michael katz name comes so often in this discussion.lol @peter pott Boeing releases new aircraft every 5 years imagine having to spend R10billion every 5 years to buy aircraft it makes no business sense when you can reduce the risk. Lease = right of use chief owning something out right doesn't always make perfect business sense true that @Thando "Dube. Now long ago SAA was in parliament. They confirm that they are paying R283m pm 
1:06:46,1:16:43, "Yes Mlungisi I would like to find out why @Thando Nkutha ......The white apartheid government put a fellow white person in solitary confinement for 7 years and you call that a WHITE PRIVLAGE?????? yes Mpho it seems even we black people we are too submissive to the whites whilst we are in our own land This enquiry sounds like a lecture. The is where out problem is. someone accept a role as a minister. And she goes to outsiders to help her understand her job. "@peter pott SAA collapsed because of bad management (especially cost)  well done Judge Zondo Ministers entitled to seek professional advises in administrative justice or legislative imperatives Basically your can wreck the place... as long as you are within the law

2:25:45,2:30:46, @hound How is it possible for these people to run a black country and its resources. "@Michael Mpagi it all goes back to the SARB  "Michael Mpagi people who were elected by 2007 in polokwane are all who led the countto these mess and Malema now he makes a lot of noise about them whereas he campaigned for them and bet with his life Go and read about Brian Menell and his links to Patrice Motsepe. He and Ramaphosa are BEE billionnaires. @Elson thanks. It’s true The Queen of leafs did anyone also watch the job summit. South africa has no serious technical jobs directed to the black people The giver 
2:31:37,2:34:14, The government is obsessed about creating jobs yet on the other hand is bleeding about public servants wage bill. Who is testifying next guy? lol @Thando Nkutha.LOL😂😂 Pravin? its gordan do yourself a favor. watch on youtubr Mark Patey Executive Lecture Lol Thando @hound @marc South Africa president said they'll start manufacturing trains with the new company gibela. 61% is owned by France and 30% by South Africa .....

If these idiots who are in power can stop looting you'll realize that SA would not need to be making loans from abroad 
2:42:46,2:47:33, Lol 😎 ANC shouldn't in the first place made Zuma both party and state President... This state capture disease is the result of wrong decision made ANC in selecting Jacob Zuma as a leader I wonder if white people used to complain about the apartheid government as much as they do about the present day government. from willing seller willing buyer to willing investor @Hound we would have been locked up "so basically this lady is a victim herself @Eslon Eslon I was castigated by my friends when I said exactly that. Here is a man who is said to have a corrupt relationship with a civilian by the court. And you go and make him a statesman. FOOLS yeah. I was researching everything I could and most of the job training is done outside of Africa . they are no manufacturing of phones or anything most is from China and Europe 
2:47:54,2:55:23, @Eslon Eslon Today they can't even look at me in the EYE when they say I was right about this CORRUPT guy joh... "@Hound just you wait and see my dear that means we are dependant on these countries and continent for our clothing food and shelter. South Africa is labelled the best of Africa.....i disagree. South Africa is economically dominated "Yes Mr is the current CEO of Transnet #Thando Nkutha Zuma was for black people to be honest but we blacks hate on him.. Inferiority complex here!! Yes @Thando Nkutha Up to this day China still practices open racism and are not apologetic about it. Ask any african living or and or working in China. There's places were black people are now allowed to enter. 
2:55:36,2:56:48, This state capture thing will damage ANC Zuma was for his pocket and his family - never for black people! He is on suspension as we speak ... and the SA lays a red carpet for them Gama is not the CEO of Transnet..... he was fired 10 days ago @motlalentoa letsosa -Zuma damaged the ANC "which black people @Sthakathi  Who stole the moneys from VBS? Can they just call Zuma to this commission so he must end this once and for all. The jokers are wasting our time.
