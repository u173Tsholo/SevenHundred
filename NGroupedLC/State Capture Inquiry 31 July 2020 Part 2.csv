time,11:12,message more ducking and diving and here I was looking forward to Monday :elbowcough: one really angry chair she has done her self no favours some witnesses the show no respect for this commission "as a judge @bongile sango agree they show no respect 
11:26,13:05, @ Bev Judge Makhubelo she has ignored a direct order by DSJ and the commission She was counting on the normal court procedure where it would have been struck off the rolls which would have given a long time before she had to appear I am signing off on a Warrant of Arrest on this Thug Judge as we speak DCJ set a example mr chair Her delays are because she wants to get her lies in order. @ Roza too true issues a warrant Judge Maqobele is messing around with DCJ and the nation.Cannot continue Waste of taxpayers money 
13:10,14:52, If not there on Monday it is clearly contempt Contempt already you are being to soft how are you going to write ur reports going on like this It’s judge Makhubela @Roza that's what I've been preaching thank u bongile ok thanks she dont need nothing she had her papers for 6months WTFlip!!! 
15:17,17:50, He is taking all her excuses for Monday away but clearly he wants to see her pretty face chair I don't understand why you soft like this @Jenny. He is keeping the doors half open and I dont know why on Monday the lady is ill everytym they adjourn nobody shud be paid no work no pay sorry I think he is removing all charges that the evidence given was under duress if the things said here are to be used in criminal court @Barbara Sattler Or has another puncture "I am still waiting to see what her car looks like after the ""so-called"" accident she had" how is chair going to give arrest warrants 
17:53,19:47, It is clear people do not know how to properly use the mask. @Mike Durban that's what she is doing laughing and having a glass of wine another postponement is bs. Zondo is too accommodating to these thugs. Waiting for her to have a positive Covid If so I volunter to go and take the confirmation swabs I am disappointed with the way people would delay such things they are wasting our tax... cry my beloved country "Watch closely An innocent person doesn't behave this way. Maybe she is busy in court and when were you appointed as a judge? 
19:47,22:15, "@Gina deW Then the team must send her a message via this chat @Ann you rite I'm really wonder about DCJ Zondo........reckon he's showing weakness....now the other accused will take advantage etc.... She would have known she was booked to work in court days ago she could have picked up the phone to excuse herself The commission has also developed a slow puncture @Mike...totally agree i think they need us there Next is going to happen to all these they don't want to appear they going to say they afraid of Covid19. @Pastor J On it. 
22:18,24:14, I think they need Judge Judy "Lets look at this sequence. Int & Nat laws violated "@Anne....and if she is cheeky Gotto respect Judge Judy........tells it like it is hey..... Pastor Pk @Roza...my bad Aunty It will only be interesting if the DCJ puts his foot down and authorises an arrest warrant for her non appearance. This level of contempt on top of the indications of dishonesty she is mocking DCJ Ha ha ha Highest paid person on TV j 
24:16,27:07, Have you noticed Zuma has not been sick or in Cuba recently? But when it's his turn to give evedience he'll be in critical condition. Circumstantial at best - what are you actually saying? @Collen that is true "@Cplleen...we will make sure that he is in a critical condition if he tries to evade us again "He said If JZee is innocent.........then why he gotta worry.....makes you think hey....... SA is not even my country but my heart bleeds for you. !@@$$ f. lock the lot up :yt: 
27:14,30:19, "The commission is looking for answers "Interesting times Roza they all crooks and bleeding the country Beginning to think if all this will ever reach the courts....i'm losing faith big time....... wake up mr hulley "@MIKE DURBAN Now that the amendment has been signed allowing the NPA access to the legal & investigative teams documents "...A postulation; SA will evolve into a model government This oke is spinning big time Shame .....Hulley is sick and tired of all this crap.....heheh 
30:25,35:44, "This report is boring now @Anne M. ....Geeeez....i sure hope so......SA needs that....badly...... "Yup I can't remember how this whole rendition saga ended. Any one with info? @Granny...Badly sadly. 2 that was returned to Zim was killed. I think there will only be the small fry in court They will be thrown under the bus by the real criminals Too much money to hire best lawyers and play in Staringrad Starlingrad It's not the first rendition and it won't be the last. Happening internationally And if anybody says otherwise.......they bloody brainwashed.... 
36:32,41:02, He Can't we arrange for something like this for the Guptas? Werksmans can defend them and cry for months but it will be great for the country you cant think for mcbride Factual arguments always speak louder than noise. The evidence leader is on McBride side. He is not here to assist the Chair. He has taken side already He's singing from the song book as Nhleko @dennis oldude ...People won't corporate with the people of SA. They should take this matter to court. The commission should proceed with corruption "Guyz the real movie is coming on Monday when a judge takes the stand 
41:21,44:49, if rendition is not an option - how about kidnapping "No sir. He is stating his case @Sal SA you are correct. This matter must be taken to court "Skilish I am so happy about your observation sanibonani! bathini ? ubani owadla lemali? Deep Cherry who is the judge? On what matter. ...ZONDO IS THE ONLY PERSON ACTING AS THE PEOPLE OF SA. The investigators are acting for the people of SA. Thanks Dennis "@Phillip Cwazibe Judge Makhubele 
45:50,49:38, H Sal - any attempt to take it to court will open the whole NPA Jiba can of worms again - based on this idiots opinion? so much noise covering up so much BS McBride is going to lose this new job The importance of hearing the other side of the story is so crucial Wandile Khowa It is very crucial indeed!! Who is this guy. he sounds believable I agree with you Wandile 100% highly prepared for this A person who has been wrongly accused can't wait to tell their side but this ducking and diving shows some thing else this guy gives irrelevant examples and talks too much 
50:01,50:59, Im totally lost.He is here to defend who and for what corruption? And I will continue to interpret the provisions of the act to support what I have said and done -th commission is wrong - Let me teach you how to think DCJ I know better than you @Glorify Gumede he is the director of the law firm that investigated IPIDs condcut intelligence is mcbrides whole life he is trying to justify his useless report @Glorify Gumede Mr July is a lawyer from Werksmans Attorneys who were appointed to look into the rendition matter. I did a ton of analytical work for the government back in the early 2000's. I'm in the U.K but would really like to direct my various reports to the appropriate H.O.Ds. Any suggestions guys? @Wandile Khowa thanks i joined now so i will try to follow buddies of the exx police minister 
51:30,53:07, why would mcbride tell lies done so much in liberation "He is here to justify why he recommended that McBride Mcbride is a devil in sheeps clothing the whole of the state is corrupt the whole of the anc is is only my phone that got this funny noise? He is not justifying anything he is giving evidence on their investigation that's all😊😊 comrades who are clean boys are the same people who helped disband the scorpions 
53:17,55:43, Noise is here too thats what our country needs working to protect your country. The devil we need new poltical party and electoral changes @Bongile...no.its the audio Remember...McBride....the Bomber....... After his recommendation how did the case? herman mashaba for president "DCJ Zondo is experienced and intelligent McBride really need to come here to clarify lot of things 
55:56,57:12, How many people did the South African Police kill Hence McBride all of the sudden asks for postpostments cross examine this clever man @Pastor J ......Yes......that's right.......and now he's a Big Boy in the ANC.........lovely Govt we have hey..... he says he says "Dramat left the police ":dothefive:stop l this guy is cofing the truth now but please are not changed? he brought madiba in:dothefive: 
57:49,59:52, what evidence? point of corrections people are not changed? We need to move on from this evidence - DCJ and the nation has heard enough of this rendition issue. it seems like they were settling personal scores. "But the guy is consistent in his story Is he talking about Cuba? my fone sounds like a tlb reversing What I can say people are still going to be killed by police if things are still going to be like this power this guy he knows what is he talking about Whose this witness? 
59:58,1:02:30, It sounds like a someone forgot to turn off their phone. He's an excellent spin doctor That beeping noise is extremely annoying. @SABC News Fix your audio its giving an annoying beeping sound! "Guys July was leading the team that wrote the Werksmans Attorneys report that investigated IPID regarding the rendition of Zimbabwean nationals Is eNCA streaming @Lala Papa the noise is really annoying well said redeemer spot on Kwazi was Werkmens on the payroll @bongile sango Exactly! ...Is the internet slow or something for why it's not broadcasting properly ? 
1:02:53,1:05:11, "@Sal SA there was no payroll the signal is out of sync @Sal SA eNCA last time I check they were not broadcasting DCJ let's have tea and move on ha a Thanks Bongile whose this witness? this guy 🙄 "@Anovuyo Mbande its Sandile July 
1:05:20,1:07:37, The witness has a very commendable memory! This guy is clear the audio is bad Thank you @Kwazi Buthelezi "Can someone fill me in on what's going on waffles and waffles let me check again eNCA this noise is not sounding nice @Gwyn Matthews Mmmm. ..I like waffles please 
1:07:56,1:09:59, "July has excellent knowledge of IPID Commission has McBride and Jele's affidavits. Answers he is giving here are there. Comm had time to detect wrong things. @SABC News please sort out this annoying sound asseblief tog Still eNCA is off yes with strawberries and cream mr hulley come on now we need you bring back the death penalty brb = afk djc come on 
1:10:23,1:12:17, @Roza essack ...Hulley wants to nail someone for arrest to come about. Lols Chair chair you seemed to be the one who is delaying the commission Mr July was batting for the minister noise is off now Thanks Bongile Mr Hulley wants to nail someone 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 thanks @SABC News the sound is now off chair is not giving hulley a chance to nail anybody 
1:12:54,1:14:19, @Roza essack indeed do u have evidence of that """in terms of what im interested in "The chair as the person in charge ...investigators earn point for performance. trust me this witness is coming back monday Lawyers make for frustrating witnesses "AWE this is all hearsay 
1:15:01,1:17:35, hulley got a chappie nd he wants to chew it till its finished he need to be cross questioned by McBride lawyers to prove his theory "This bra being questioned is k@k nervous listen now to the chair is the aircon on ? for me this now is making me angry @Bradley 🤣 July has nothing to be nervous about purpose of commission is not whether his report was right or wrong in its conclusions now djc is calling harrasment 
1:17:38,1:19:45, I miss Agrizzi and Mokonyanes Pitch. The Commision was moving Mr Hulley and Zondo are miles apart in thinking @Sthakathi Khumalo true mr hulley leave this witness let him go free u wasting ur tym mr chair is going to block whatever u saying chair must bring back all adv were here before because these one we got now their questioning mh mh is top notch "Zondo "Is this mese stupid DMF YES "...There is a certain protocol for administering Law and or Constitutional Law. At this point 
1:19:48,1:21:53, Is that Ngcukayithobi.. "Mr July is performing very excellent so far Yes he is representing July Bophelo Malapela I could hear haha and thanks. This lawyer just need's to bring out his inner colouredness. Things will move on quick @Skhathi I think that was him Mr July is using some facts and a lot of hearsay eish this guy needs a strepsil 
1:21:58,1:23:10, malema @Sal SA what hearsay when he conducted the investigation malema @Bradley Petersen 🤣 VBS at first glance i thought this is Aaron Motswaledi Hon im out @Madodana Tuntulwana To a point where people even ask if is the witness for or against Nhleko before listening to the witness. MALEMA 
1:23:24,1:26:20, too much word salad ..bottom line who did the crime It would never be a hearsay when Mr July used interviews and wide range of investigative info at his disposal. Mr July is a smart guy "July is clear though Mr July going to jail in August For what @Bradley Petersen ? ul not going anywhere "I dont know Madodana we are interpreting the evidence as citizens of SA and not involved in the system 
1:26:22,1:28:37, 😂😂😂 @bradley Petersen going to jail for what crime no Mr Chair it's not fair at all to put so much pressure on the evidence leader Who's Mr July ? question...how is any of this improving the lives of ordinary SA citizens? lots of talk...legal terms (which the majority of people do not understand). Miss June’s brother so they get the facts/evidence. what then? Mr July is clear it just that many have already made up their mind about who is guilty and who is innocents. If you touch the perceived angels irrespective of the facts you are labelled as a GUPTA. "fokal 
1:28:47,1:30:44, he so wants to recline that chair @Herb Truck... i guess 30 June Bradley I feel your unhappiness. Take a 15min tea break @Herb Tuck @Pieter Engelbrecht This is critical for SA. We need rule of Law as foundation for this country. We need politicians/civil servants to understand they’ll be held accountable for their action. 😂 @Saneman If he wants to recline the chair so what? @Mangalani Mangalani Agreed. But it seems nowadays law means nothing really. How does reclining the have to do with his evidence. 
1:31:32,1:35:03, @Pieter Engelbrencht But we shldnt give in. Sal SA...arrest is.... did you see that sweat droplet fall from his head ? mmm Sweating alcohol would be profitable now and a benefit when are they getting to the un-banning of smokes His muzzle under the chin ..is that SA fashion thing @Saneman seems like it 
1:35:28,1:38:34, I like it I think this commission is just a waist of money 🤔🤔🤔🤔 "Ridiculing does not improve any argument @Lazarus Ramoba yes it is. @Lazurus Ramoba thats your opinion @Saneman the chair really worries you. Time for #DirectElections I'm not sure where Hulley is going with this but i'm not impressed so far 
1:38:49,1:43:27, Indeed the Commission is helping SA to know the factual side of things. We are now privy to information that has been distorted for years. If report not used even if changed no obstruction of justice so no reason to charge with defeating ends of justice So trial was set up to remove those making state capture difficult Zoned for preside "This commission should get Adv Adila Hassim president "@Jonathan Ganesh  Mr July is zoned "..Sure August 
1:43:45,1:45:51, September October november December Mr July so far has clearly indicated and identified wrongs committed Happy New Year !!!! I am starting to wonder if it is necessary for IPID to produce reports 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 mere listener I am 
1:46:12,1:48:50, @XhoiXhoi GrandSon yoh july "@XhoiXhoi GrandSon  another masquerade... enjoy people. July at the end of July! xhoi xhoi stop it @Aunty Roza......You tell him Tannie #facepalm this is not a platform for racism 
1:49:12,1:51:43, Zondo is saving Mr July....the guy is only teaching The Chair how Ipid conduct their invetigation & report which is a waste of time this is for intelligent people thanks roza...i had a feeling i'm intelligent but now i know @Xhoi Xhoi....Please interact respectfully and take note of the rest of us....Or maybe you are on the wrong channel? People expect this to be like an episode of law and order or some American legal drama. Legal proceedings are generally tedious & boring yes plz dont lower urselves to racist Agree with you chair - strange technicalities.. "...To avoid testifying...move to Ethiopia its a public broadcast doez not give u a reason to disrespect others 
1:52:07,1:53:42, @pastor J DONT WORRY ABOUT AN IDIOT @Xhoi Xhoi...Please man. Public or not dont disrespect 133 others on the chat. Go elsewhere if you feel the urge to disrespect 1341 @Roza essack so true. but this is unfortunately the disease that social media brings. XhoiXhoi are you by any chance related to Andile Lungisa or Andile Mngxithama or both? @Herb...you are right "yes it is @Xhoi Xhoi...It is a criminal offence to do that...@SABC News take note @Jonathan Ganesh diapers are expensive 
1:53:45,1:55:33, won't a towel suffice? use toilet paper "@XhoiXhoi GrandSon  @Pieter...I have a new granddaughter and I have lots of disposed Diapers to give away. From Sri Lanka There are these 3 dots that allows you to block BOTS!! I use it to my full advantage-there are some lonely souls searching for attention online I have just reported his comments. you can only say you did not mean to disrespect you can't say if others felt disrespected since it is evident several did please change you attitude me2 
1:55:56,1:57:18, gud afternoon guys @Xhio Xhoi...No one has defended anyone but simply trying to protect ourselves from an idiot....We have had enough of you one XhoiXhoi Grandson one PK? One PK coming up. """ 2 UNDERSTAND WHAT CORRUPTION DOES 2 A COUNTRY Agreed its with mentality like this we cant move foward in our countrt country "no no 
1:57:20,2:01:05, i pray they dont kill him @Roza essack country* pieter did that @Sal.....100% agreed commision of inquiry into XhoiXhoi Grandson's statement @Sal SA awe "wait "@XhoiXhoi GrandSon. I defend your right to make your point. However he looks surprised that he is still questioning him lol 
2:01:42,2:03:41, heavens know...not another day lol hah ha ha XhoiXhoi just made me remember why i love drinking beer "@XhoiXhoi GrandSon. Apologies @Jonathan Ganesh lol @XhoiXhoi GrandSon Het jou tor van sy coke doppie afgeval? :dothefive: We're here to help XhoiXhoi 
2:03:55,2:05:51, Help us help you spell properly to find you lol so we can talk and listen and understand how about we replace on bullet with one hug "...Like a confession yoh during or after covid-19? "Whislt going to Xhoi 
2:06:10,2:09:01, hehe the knot has been untied. The report was to be used to legitimate the suspension of Anwat Dramat so that Ntlemeza can take over. I'm blocking XhoiXhoi - to do so highlight the name and select ' Block' Yup that's an option @XhoiXhoi GrandSon. Now you are being facetious! C'mon! I'm being serious. But i like to hear both sides...far left and far right #facepalm This is not the forum to settle political scores "@Jonathan Ganesh. Please keep your preferences to yourself. Either add to the discourse """legitimize """ 
2:09:34,2:12:45, why not just blame the idiot that signed the extradition papers?!! But July has been clear in his articulation. "I just wonder why on EARTH did McBride go to state capture. He had won I agree Naledi People come to state capture to settle political scores like some have said and its true "Wow 49 farm murders according to police stats!!!Make love  Thank you Sal SA and Pastor J. Let's keep it civil and on point. Respect!!🙏 "K 
2:13:01,2:14:29, let's hear what the commission has to say "@Pastor J Looks like g o a t ' s brother is on the chat. Need to make a bigger fire "The way Mr July is fighting to save his life in that commission @Jonathan Ganesh . No JG. I'm not. Can we get past the trolling nonsense and enjoy each other's decent comments please? @Anne...Enough for both. Can include a sister as well thank you @Pastor J Respect @Gugulethu Xhosans you have a problem It seems like Judge Zondo has what he wanted from this witness 
2:14:59,2:19:07, @mandla nkosi yup July has a very interesting posture. You mean cute🤣 lol July is not a push over. like with any other country lol "...No official gives respect to the Constitution/people Zimbabwe and South African police do have meetings together 
2:19:39,2:21:33, @Jonathan Ganesh. Indeed! Definitely a breach in terms of a foreign force unless sanctioned at official level by SAPS. Did this rendition ever take place or was it a figment of someone's imagination? so...how dafuq do you get that right where is the law now gonna give someone a call and go there his making alot of assumptions and as law goes that's wrong. "this is shocking to me The rendition took place and people died Where was it proven Mandla? 
2:21:41,2:23:38, Policing in a foreign country must be unlawfull Anything is possible in SA Remember the Guptas landing at Waterkloof wth no documentation?? ANY collaboration/cooperation by sovereign law enforcement agencies should have been sanctioned by Interpol or its legal equicalent. Oops! Pardon spelling! @Luvuyo Zantsi there are certain organizations that can operate in any country. ...Gerda 7 ...TREASON is correct...... #facepalm Are they discussing immigration charges or state capture? At this rate the issue of prosecuting the thieves will never conclude time up!! 
2:23:47,2:25:00, @Jonathan Ganesh you had enough hibiscus tea Number one had a call and Guptas landed at W#aterkloof? @Pieter Engelbrecht There is a difference between structures like Interpol and foreign country police. "Violation of international laws @Luvuyo Zantsi agreed. but we will never know. @Jonathan Ganesh . Behave please. Yep that is why there was an investigation. The Police Portfolio Committee was asking questions to Nathi Mthethwa who was the Minister then @Jonathan Ganesh that was my point earlier We excuse you Ganesh 
2:25:06,2:26:51, @mandla nkosi Nathi Nhleko not Mthethwa. Yes Jonathan agree with you . Waste of time and money only State Security can give permission for another foreign security to work in our country through the permission of the president and the minister of police Jonathan you don't need a crystal ball to conclude that @thabo segonyonyo so how did USA order the execution of certain people in the middle east? wait...they used drones...nevermind No Sir Nathi Mthethwa. Rendition took place during Mthethwa's era "@Jonathan Ganesh . Put the brakes on please General Sibiya recently won a labour court case for being fired because of this rendition case. 
2:27:26,2:30:45, Mr Hulley is trying to hard. What has this trial have to doe with proving the guilt of the miscreants? USA also did extradition in SA many years ago by the CIA. I think it was in Ladysmith @mandla nkosi Nathi Nhleko was in this commission last week and he was asked about this "It is so informative to watch and listening to this testmony. It gives us the honest truth "@Jonathan Ganesh . Perhaps it is. Nevertheless just his hair do makes you know he has alot on his head @Madodana Tuntulwana but how do you know this is the truth? Yes he was there because he commissioned an investigation by Welshman and he suspended Dramat and Mcbride but the rendition took place before him as Minister of Police sir 
2:30:48,2:34:42, @Sal SA. they got permission from the state security and they were accompanied by the minster of foreign affairs and the general of defence force Says who Thanbo "@mandla nkosi Ok sorry Thabo @Luvuyo 👍👍 Thabo if rendition is illegal how can they get state approval. Not allowed "@Jonathan Ganesh . Perhaps. But I reiterate (especially in the US) the practice of sending a foreign criminal or terrorist suspect covertly to be interrogated in a country with less rigorous regulations for the humane treatment of prisoners. "@Luvuyo Zantsi Nathi Mthethwa was Minister of Police when the rendition occurred. Nathi Nhleko appointed Werksmans and suspended Dramat 
2:34:48,2:38:17, The head of Foreign Intelligence Services takes office sorounded by gross allegations of cross border crime. South Africa is not getting better @Sals SA. you can go back to that case and check. it was published remember after it happened. hence anything that happens out your borders gets published 14 after the mission. A lesson to be learnt is that we should not conclude on guilt after listening to only one witness without hearing the other side of the story. @Luvuyo Zantsi . Absolutely agree. "Rendition/Extradition and a Sanctioned Arrest are 3 distinctly difference processes. The first is illegal and the f @Anne M. Thanks. I havealready conceded the point to @mandla nkosi My bad @Luvuyo Zantsi Why no long drawn out answers now? I'm interested to find out how many here are practicing law? 
2:38:26,2:39:55, @Jonathan Ganesh . I'm surprised that you are still listening/watching this inquiry. Or are you just here for your personal amusement? Nothing bad @Anne M. You were assisting. "Thabo Daily Maverick quote ""The Open Society Foundation found 136 people had gone through the process of “extraordinary rendition” and 54 countries were complicit in it What's the full name of Mr. July? We pray for Mr Mandilonga's soul. He died. Yes he did. @Jonathan Ganesh . Then I welcome your thoughtful commentary. Sandie July Sandile I hope Pieter you listening 
2:39:58,2:43:13, @Luvuyo Zantsi . thanks what did i miss? @Pastor J . Eloquently stated. just listen @Albert Noah You're welcome Judges have a very difficult job I will remain a mechanic 🤗 @Naledi...Thank you my friend How does a second report remove information from the first one? could someone please explain that to me 
2:43:55,2:45:26, "@Jonathan Ganesh. Beyond your joviality corruption that is why it was removed Pieter it happens in business environments bleachbit same as hillary clinten did "ok @Pieter...If it is found to be Incorrect/Hearsay and or Unsubstantiated and so forth. same person "@Pastor J thanks @redeemed sinner Thus right. unfortunate that suspects of crime ran to the Commission and the evidence leaders failed to ask key questions. Now the commission evidence leaders are defending them 
2:45:42,2:52:22, @Pieter...Indeed so but not if it was simply a draft/working document "Pieter apologies it sounds to me this evidence leader are being paid by mc bride and company @Jonathan Ganesh. Sorry JG. 14 000 kms divides us. Now shush up and add meaningful commentary. @Daniel. Can't understand why McBride was even allowed to come and waste this Commission time. Hidden agendas at play @Madodana Tuntulwana thank you for you honesty 🙂 Danie that is the exact picture we are unfortunately being given by the lead investigator. @Daniel McBride will head Foreign Intelligence. I think the qualifying criteria for the position is how much have you lied without being caught. this is important people died here at least one 
2:53:10,2:58:26, Danie all people are important yes it is true even corrupt ones what make one person more important than other...and who decides on this? i think i stayed because i find human behavior and interaction very interesting "@Jonathan Ganesh. Your levity has a laugh-by date. Again And before anybody thinks that S.A is the only government in trouble. Please think again - China is experiencing some serious Karma. The U.K is led by an utter buffoon. The U.S? I won't go there. dude you have stickies on your pages...no need to guess the page number What k@k is this man on about now? as well closer to home africa is not a prism of an etopia in corrupt officials 
2:58:26,3:00:55, @Jonathan Ganesh . Not going anywhere. Am interested in this inquiry. prima facie : accepted until proven otherwise for those that do not know "As we come to the end of this day I Pray and wish each of you and your Dear Families a Wonderful and Blessed evening and weekend. Go Safe thanks @Pastor J @Jonathan Ganesh . \enough already! Thank you @Pastor J @Pastor J have a great and blessed weekend @Pastor J and the same to you Amen and same to you Pastor J. 
3:00:59,3:02:41, "@Pastor J . Blessed Be. Stay safe To you and yours as well @Pastor J Thanks Pastor you too here it comes now..... "DCJ you got to do something. Khuba lied to you. Sisoko lied to you "@Jonathan Ganesh you're a silly dude and that's cool Bless everyone....and especially.......SA.......we need it badly............ @Naledi Barron don't feed a troll. lol 
3:03:23,3:07:57, "@Jonathan Ganesh. I think you're on/in the wrong forum. Please get lost. Thanks @Pieter Engelbrecht  BREAKING NEWS: Cigarette ban has been lifted Yahooo......Puza time........Cheers... Hey Guys.......Johnny Walker/Castle time.......relax dudes...... "@Bradley Petersen. Hopefully peeps have taken up vaping looks like everyone in the courts needs a beer July clears Nhleko Yebo...........Bring on the Curry Bunnies as well......heheh @Luvuyo. I agree with you 
3:08:26,3:13:29, no..this is so nice...... irrelevant he said maybe a final question...who's funding this commision? The allegation was that Nhleko appointed Werksman as a hit squad. That is being seriously challenged. "@Jonathan Ganesh one problem Judge Zondo won't find the truth in this commision "retracting messages only hide them in chat @Luvuyo Zantsi anyone still thinking McBride has nothing to answer must listen and think again. Ngamanyala la wait.. so corruption 
3:13:32,3:15:25, whats the root of that? "Lets start a movement.......""Jail For Capture"".....or something.........heheh" The meaning of hit squad is misunderstood by certain people yes yes so if i have money and ask those corrupt to do something in order to push my agenda what do you think wil happen will* 
3:15:36,3:17:24, "hao bathong i just came in now jarre bra "@Pieter Engelbrecht . Corruption at gov't level is endemic in many countries. The trick is you're like internet explorer "on chi nothing wow..we went from inquiry to internet explorer to chi so they stole the lights too?? the farmers should leave south Afrika so back when did this commistion start? 
3:17:36,3:19:16, and it's still going right? taxpayer's money? "boycott south africa again  or are they paying out of their own pockets to get to the truth of things? boycott south africa "@Pieter Engelbrecht . Bottom line is this - manage what you can @Naledi Barron so true. we geven money to incompetent leaders geen cent meet
