2:06:45,2:08:07, ANC doesn't care about the poor adv maleka would have been a bttr adv @Riaan DW..it's Cyril bcoz he's the wmc puppet they told they can't afford R5500 which Zuma wanted..so it's easy to blame gvmnt whilst these boses are eating ppl's sweat nd act as if they're ryt. ANC don't care about the poor "Zuma The house has never moved away from there? "Could not afford it because Zuma spent it all  "wmc ANC made the people poor. 
2:08:31,2:11:04, @Riaan DW the ANC blames the white man for black poverty to get voters. 26 years is enough time to make your own national Party did not care about poor people as well..all politicians are mafias..politics is a dirty game Black privilege is not helping their poor brothers "When sheep are led by the nose that long "yes Can somebody give the advocate some smirnoff he's fast asleep. what's a black privilege? lol "@Hosia Modiga No man

"She was in the meetings fine eatlng up all the corupt money "This advocate looks like he's defending her seems like this was rehearsed Whats happening with the lawyers spectacles? 
2:14:18,2:17:29, mama action she willl leave this commission smoking bcz of this adv just read from the script Nomvula almost a billion spent here and no one arrested. Let me steal a bread and I'll go to jail makes me want to quit my job just so i dont pay tax anymore @ Jean-Pierre fully agree! I find it very strange that she is denying all this accusations. but then couldn't they asked Agreesy to crossexamine her lol true "She will deny everything the ruling families only make the money

Is this the same Gavin of which she speaks who on video counting out millions in cash for bribes ? we know you you are ANC Mabala Noise Bosslady is contradicting herself. @Mike yes Gavin Watson Useless evidence leader.!!!!! she didnt steal money she laundered it 
2:23:34,2:24:28, I wasn't aware she's got husband i think the adv will turn the corner guyz like all the rich people What fascinates me is in the election next year we will STILL vote back in the ANC whilst she cruises around R6 m Astin Martin he is denying that you are denying haaibo let's hope the chair will come with useful question to assist the Adv to arrive at the truth she laundered it in real estate i bet she went too far in the script there 
2:24:48,2:26:33, @Mike Mike how do you what car she drives A Lie You Cant Remember or a bunch of small businesses its bad Nomvula she looks like she owns small clothing stores China Is Helping The ANC "Oh stop stealing money get a job Talk talk 
2:26:34,2:27:48, We are still looking for one ANC member that admits his/her guilt. Looks like we are going to wait ....... so obviously lying phendula mbuzo pleas The question was: who paid for it is not about the chair "where the money WHY DID WOULD GOVERN HAVE AN INTEREST IN YOUR CHILD? Haaaaa.. liar... uyadwaba lo cc yhuu 
2:27:48,2:29:24, Ironic how Ministers won't even let their children study at our public schools. Problem the adv cant cross- examine the witness as it is not allowed in commissions except to put Agrizzi's version to the winess.Thats why the adv looks as if he is fumbling. all the rich people hoard the money yoooo hayi she hid it in a hole "China wants our mines "then when we can't pay China back the money If the child is not employed full or part time by Bosasa then it illegal to hire transport for child. @Tumelo Magasha where are Malema kids studying? where did Cyril kids study? 
2:29:39,2:31:48, her child must be invited as well how do you make your shaved head shine like the head of the adv #TheShining?😂😂 @TheC4RB1N3 Spot on regarding China. A very dangerous country. i didnt want to mention too much glycerine "they r intimidated by her already even the chair seems already intimidated then ppl say im racist its in a safe in her house 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂glycerine??? so everyone has a feast and we pay 
2:32:05,2:32:38, Paul Ely are You? 😂😂 "The only thing they agree with is her name only not the allegations "Just do a lifestyle audit on her. Can she afford the cars  "My head shines more than his i have never seen such an incompetent lawyer this one.....he only deserves to work in magistrates courts Nomvula Mokonyane says her children cannot get jobs because of the proximity with her. Can you believe it? disgracefull in brown dude im brown 
2:33:01,2:33:39, Cyril would of been wort $40 billion if he were actually a business man and used the money that he stole through BEE to make jobs. show it Riaan!😂😂 i want to be the COE of Bosasa and hire my family & friends as they are all adults bossasa is anc . communist party? didi hear tig :thanksdoc::thanksdoc::thanksdoc: @Nkululeko Njapha definitely not at Maphutha Secondary School or Moletsane Secondary School 🤷 Seems like she likes money quite a bit for a COMMUNIST..

Eh eh eh eh @lindeni Nandi..you know she was ryt on that coz we'll never gain any economic freedom without rand falling first @Jean-Pierre Le Roux Him included. is bosasa an anc company?

You cross examine in court. 
2:39:50,2:41:18, Was she a Minister in Cabinet? no wonder we are were we are in SA! lingadinwa nangomso Ningadinwa nangomso lol I think sparks will fly when she's cross examined by Agrizzi's lawyer if that will happen. @Ettiene she was Former Environmental Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane and Mineral Resources structures to still yes . "Smoke screen like all the other ""SUCCESSFUL "" COMMISSIONS Before." hayi nandi 🙆‍♀️🙆‍♀️ @Jay Cole but most ppl don't see Cyril as a criminal bcoz he's being favoured by WMC..das Y they can't arrest anyone coz he's also got too much scandals more dan Zuma 
2:41:19,2:42:36, how do they choose these lawyers???? Watson family friend Nomvula`s not helping the commission. why hasnt she drink her water too soft drink your water bottle I love Nomvula she knows what she was doing.

"You already said a lot abt ANC that water bottle has not been opeded "Who’s advocate is this? Hope is not the State Prosecutor  
2:45:22,2:47:07, @pule tsotetsi..relax baba siyazi sifunani emzansi nd uZuma ubeseqalile ukusisa lapho esiyakhona but fools like you who believe in wmc are turning us back to amabhunu "Cyril is not a business man. he never was. The money he has Nomvula seems to be in charge u Sucking up to the Judge "@Hloniphani You're just a Zuma apologist "She is not being cross-examined "guys that water bottle is not her's BOILING THE FROG.... 
2:47:11,2:49:20, 📧 attached 🤨 why would she be accountable about the ANC running where s the head this adv is cool cat you can count how many windows and light bulbs is in the room by looking at his head. Revenge won't solve anything "@Hloniphani Ndlela as to why Cyril Ramaphosa is not seen as corrupt baffles me. He openly admitted to his son receiving money from BOSASA Well said Bruce "she has obviously prepared her story "She Talks About Herself As A Third Person'""""Nomvula Did Not Do That''''" 
2:49:22,2:52:17, accountability can "@Jay Cole  adv is nice and sleeping . "@PHIL RAMBAU  "@Nomvula Dlamini the ""in charge"" was used figuratively to suggest that her responses were well prepared and not literally being in charge" @pule tsotetsi..look where we're today..look where we were during Zuma's tenure..if you don't see it now you will stay blinded by media the rest of yo life..I don't agree to corruption. I find it so disturbing people thy opt to believe Aggrizie n have a pleasure of crucifying one of our own without proper evaluations to the matter.Who is Aggrizie'handlers? MS NOMVULA MOKONYANE DENIES AT THE STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY Communist so lets face it South Africa under the ANC is doomed 
2:52:19,2:53:44, let me smoke my SHARP cigarette Can Telkom support other political parties in SA? @Bruce spot on she says it with a smile on her face "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux - You can't say that about our president She is Correct the ANC is ruiling so obviously all businesses wants to associate themselves with them nothing wrong about that or new even Mandela was having his own private sectors handlers ? @Danny Mdi..you know ppl believe what comes from a white man nd don't trust his own but trust the enemy "The way this adv is going 
2:53:46,2:55:17, i never trusted a corrupt rotten Agrizzi at all! How can you trust someone who admited publicly that he was the corrupt dog number one? @Paul Ely:goodvibes::goodvibes::goodvibes: When they were establishing contacts to fraudulently get rich later answer the question... do you remember or not..??
