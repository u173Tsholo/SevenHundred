46:17,55:06, where is marcus jooste who stole 20 billion of government employees Puis you race batting. people of all race are investigated. and found guilty. Car manufacturers have long term contracts with the state as you cannot wake up tomorrow with a new brand in the market. So you can't change them every 3 years. The same goes for mines. "Hey Guys if Law and Order is not in place then this is what happens. Jacob Zuma white monopoly capital is not a government or Ministers let's stay in RSA and leave USA alone. we are not Americans. "@ Jacob Zuma you are ill "Well said 
57:47,1:03:00, Is there anybody on this forum who did not 'score' something from the State Capture. F#ckittt ! It seems like there is not a soul left in SA who did not benefti !! "White Monopoly Capital is a term coined out by a PR comany did business with the Guptas Jacob Zuma make sure you don't make a habit of being obnoxious cos it will stick with time Thelsa Me and my wife did not benefit @Derrick saperstein really we cannot be robbed by our people took all money to enrich themselves yet they blame white peoples for what? If there was no corruption SA would be far greater less job loss shem me to nothing from government ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ well said Elvis. Jacob Zuma has really sunk this beautiful country. Zuma needs to appear before this commission and be honest. "I am not interested with ANC division which tended to confuse people the majority are stil living in poverty 
1:04:46,1:10:13, @XhoiChoi GrandSon stop deflecting South Africa's current problems to apartheid... I never heard all this in the apartheid era. they did it discreetly "the root of the problem most also be address why always give apartheid the blame let apartheid RIP hy Pillay dont delay.come pay back the money no please not ANC members are being investigated for corruption and people are blaming Apartheid.. This is how stupidly brainwashed some people are. They are the ones who still vote for ANC that destroys SA WOW THATS MONEY FOR JAM I thinks Panda bought a real panda 
1:10:35,1:14:19, "rusty Apartheid is only a smoke screen for politicians like Jacob Zuma and his ilk to fleece this country. These greedy politicians don't give a damm for their own people who are living in squalor conditio they are not stupid just full of hate Lorraine Naidoo apartheid was bad as we all know but they left functional municipalities though state was bankrupt but systems were there and functional State capture was a Holocaust They want monies for the time they where in jail or exile blame it on post apartheid treatment. treat ppl fairly. "Political leaders should never ever loot poor peoples money what did tge ANC promise you? housing right .. so dont blame apartheid anymore then live with it but don't mess up S.A. greed and hatred will destroy us 
1:15:18,1:16:58, The legacy of apartheid is obviously going to be tough to erase. But the ANC should have done much more. It can't just always blame apartheid while they are milking the state coffers dry. the unfair post apartheid treatment created corrupt black politicians folks painting apartheid as a lesser evil then what State Capture is are smoking something very strong. Apartheid government was responsible for crimes against humanity and they killed to keep going. Xhoixhoi yes we fighting for freedom at that time .my family was locked up. "The problem is that state capture affects more people Can all the Racist nonsense stop and not be imposed on all of us on the chat....Please I appeal to you all @Xhoi dont lie . no one said anything racist. "White people will leave SA if there is economic disaster 
1:17:01,1:18:39, it will never stop the blame game the masses are in denial "real children of S.A. most claim what was stolen from them. let the back live in peace im coloured and im gonna leave actually run The blacks was treated badly .thru wont allowed in town after 9pm xhoixhoi grandson you must be taking a drug of some sort from 1978 in our township we got electricity we never had load shedding "So we can blame apartheid for Donald Trump The ANC has effectively bankrupted the country and have done little to improve the lives of millions of poor black SA'ns. Apartheid was evil but the ANC has failed. The ANC needs to be replaced with a multi party democracy Chritiaan I agree 
1:19:05,1:21:56, "my wife cheated on me lol I was watching Breitbart how I get here? lol "before apartheid and my tummy is not ok today must be apartheid corruption apologists are sickening @james 112 Breitbart is fake news Because of the looting of taxpayers money and state owned companies eg Eskom Transnet Saa etc means this country is in a dire financial state... struggling to meet its obligations. 
1:22:10,1:24:59, one of the reasons it hasn't changed is because of the ANC which demonstrates ANC has similar tactics as apartheid people because they oppress people of colour in SA @redriger Howzit Anything exciting today? No service delivery becomes racist because it perpetuates black poverty But they want to go after Tawane------ Politicians are all the same. The ANC has become just like the Nat government. Only in it for themselves. NEVER trust a politician! apartheid is death and gone corruption is the new kid on the block "ANC is back run party @XhoiXhoi GrandSon Careful what you wish for. "1287 nights accommodation at R930-00 per night 
1:25:10,1:27:49, "how can you say that apartheid was nothing EFF is the solution. job done EFF will turn SA into Zimbabwe and whites will just leave very easy eff is a solution there will be only a political elite who will bask in wealth just like Zimbabwe and there will be no economic upliftment EFF will treat ppl fairly. this is what you ppl don't want ag you can steal and do whatever you want just give apartheid the blame we have a communist in the chat that believes all the wealth should be shared and then we live in perfect harmony. Where have we heard that before..? "EFF will destroy the economy 
1:28:42,1:30:11, "Zimbabwe has 90% unemployment true The EFF are politicians - they tell you what you want to hear but are only in it for themselves. They've already started acting like politicians - stealing VBS funds and living the champagne and caviar life but wearing overalls just to fool everyone. go see what's happening in Zimbabwe then decide if you will vote eff Zimbabwe shared all the wealth "living equally doesn't mean one is communist The EFF's downfall is it's own leaders. @Rusty SpyGoat And now everybody's got nothing? 
1:30:33,1:31:58, GrandSon stay on subject or you leave. open case ar police if you have evediance of wrong doing. here it's about Durban police EFF are just a manifestation of the ANC's Cold War influence and its sad that people believe in that nonsense DEMOCRACY only works for thieves. "I mean what has Julius done apart from politics until the wealthy African's and their families invest in the research of all levels and development of the respective Countries. EFF is the ANCYL.....nothing else. how do u knw the fall of eff?? He is so reckless telling poor people to have more babies which would make them more poor xhoixhoi the more you make your statements the more you expose your ignorance 
1:32:01,1:33:25, there will be no success or achievements EFF is literally another faction of the ANC and it shows that we have been consumed by the useless ANC Holmes fortunately eff works in the opposite please let all of us who are following this and are dismayed with this government stand up and do something @redriger Agreed. "i trust no politician what do u for the people . why dont ubopen your parties and live eff alone . NO but yases ANC is such a cancer that it made the EFF and has infected people's brains 
1:33:51,1:37:41, @Vincent Sipho Khumalo Very wise - they are all the same. please can all focus on this story for now. it's about how the police functioned with rouge members. not political parties. and chain of command. how do we except police to guard us when they're corrupt to this level?. "Raven Penny "thieves ANC created EFF only eff works the opposite side. the pale skin won't never agree with malema. What I can't understand is the brothers across the border don't vote Zanu out. Same mentality thinking that EFF we save us. Complete stupidity. @Fidhffjgf Dgygd Democracy only works if the voters hold the public servants to account. DEMOCRACY will only work if voters are INTELLIGENT. we do not have that. meanwhile the system is a deceive 
1:38:19,1:39:57, "redriger Grandson. what's your point who here denies it happened. "Our present police men and women "Panday was a small fish. there is corruption taking place valued in the 100s of millions lets start educating our people in churches at school let's mobilize let the world know what's going on just with as we did with apartheid @Jabu Malinga He's one of the untouchables and must be dealt with. Are you all dumb....why aren't you actually listening to Mr. White???? "@dereck main true that "redriger 
1:40:07,1:41:16, I am Paul @Paul Buchel bagof redriger I see somebody left a bag idiots open today "Yes @Paul Buchel Multitasking "The first post apartheid child was born 25 years ago AND SHOULD be educated "@Pastor J Panday was long overdue to be in prison "DEMOCRACY  
1:41:27,1:45:26, "@Raven Penny the media can be bought common that's not relevant @moelamin jaiteh Only if you allow yourself to be sucked in by the BS. is there a need for this lady? The evidence leader ? Which lady Jabu ? let us occupy parliament let us rise up the time this commission wraps up it will be to late and then it's still the court cases Sheâ€™s seems very nervous though Derek. we have many ppl who aren't able to think rationally? wnat abut them 
1:45:47,1:48:18, @Kevin Unemployment under the youth is actually much higher than 30%. That is in my mind the ticking bomb in SA. Advocate Wenzel is forever nervous @moelamin jaiteh I don't have all the answers - I suppose it's a matter of educating them on their rights and responsibilities as voters. come on Jabu o ring ha ha ha Is the commission lookin into the capture and corruption of the entire water board of the kzn south coast which has been bankrupted. vat alles "L@moelamin  "We are stupidly Wentzel says : Chair I think he is here for the whole of tomorow. Wentzel shouldnâ€™t think but know that level of detail. Lols hawu 
1:48:27,2:01:01, Derek. are they doing that really. if we really know the kind of ppl we putting in office I swear we wouldn't be having such issue at first "free Why did they choose such a long winded retired judge Oh then just judge I fall asleep when he talks Those who lack knowledge normally have a lot to say and are very judgemental if they have so much work to get through why not start at 8:30 and finish at 18:00 Panday and family have been charged and going to trial shortly. This morning they made application to Zondo to exclude this dudes testimony because it is prejudiced. Its a slam dunk case ðŸ˜‚ if police are so corrupt then where do you report corruption
