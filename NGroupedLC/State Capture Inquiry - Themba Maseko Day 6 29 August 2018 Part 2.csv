Guptas all the time 🤔 Mr. Maseko knows what he's talking about and am so impressed Advocate Mokoena is still the best in term of leading the witness. he knows every think i am also very impressed 
23:14,25:47, .... guptas take the SA .......😏😏😏 "Whats the name of that dark beautiful girl/lady sitting at the back Mr. Maseko appears a very credible and impressive witness. let's see how he fares under cross examination. so many people are going to be implicated here he knows everything Maseko is about to snitch 😁 their trying to make us forget about LAND 
26:34,33:51, We havent forgotten about LAND Maseko is level headed @Sabelo.. Not even lottery win will make us forget about the Land. We need it by yesterday. The land is coming...thieves must also go to jail Ajay was the main character😁 @Van Heerden you always watching "My assessment of evidence adduced this far Hawks are corrupt. That entity MUST be disbanded and closed. They are implicated everywhere. We can't have an justice agency that is sinister. there is a clear case of corruption. why not go straight to court and lets the culprits face music 
34:46,37:41, ey guys are like women u talk'n'eat u gud at multitasking yho Bring back the scorpions because these hawks are useless Zaza Scorpions were out immediately Zuma became an President we need to go through cross examination to identify gap and lawyers always do root cause analysis not go straight to the point Hello to you too Zinqa Phantsi nge Hawks phantsi! phantsi!! Uyaxoka Marvel! What about Agliotti? 
37:49,42:26, What about Brett Kebble? Those were not blacks! Hawks were used as a bulldozing machine by Zuma loyalists People had their names reputations dragged through the mud because they were incorruptible I need New Friends 😃 knock knock i avail myself hey that is as a new friend 
42:33,47:33, THUSO IM AM AVAILABLE hi everyone Thando are you special? The Hawks are behaving like the ANC. "@thusa lets concentrate on inquiry guys bring back the scorpions.. simple this is bad "Agliotti 
47:38,49:12, hawks are involved in heists and turning blind eye on ANC hitmen BERNARD............? Captain Masilela must come take the stand Hello Xolani m They destroyed the scorpions for this very reason. So they can control & fiddle with cases Hawks wore ANC underpants spokesman for Hawks must resign ant truthfull Bernard Ntlemeza is just a fool. They used him. He's got no game plan. 
49:13,51:02, OF COURSE WE ARE WATCHING THE INQUIRY NJE ? I don't even think that the report of this inquiry will be taken serious. Just like others. waste of tax money thuso we must see convictions Berning Ntlemeza must come before the enquiry as well! "@Thuso - Lets be positive Hence my position Thuso that we go straight to court. bantus need jobs Thuso Ramaphosa will effect investigations believe me! @thando cezula I hope 
51:05,52:03, Even now we know that Hawks are compromised! as he was present all the time we need to build bigger houses so that bantus can work in our gardens taxpayers money just wasted the we go Indeed these criminals must be paraded in front of the whole country ANC started the Hawks. Guys do you think Zuma will ever take the stand? For the last 10 years Colin 
52:13,53:32, "colin All roads lead to ANC @thando cezula he must I have to believe you Comrades Now I'm awake.Wonder what's this Maseko man is saying!! "@Thando - He will take a stand White taxpayer's money? "At the end of the commission yes @thando 
53:46,56:04, Watch and learn. high profiled witnesses this year?????😳 WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAWYER????? @Thando Nkutha this is the place for Zuma to clear his name he always mentioned that Men in suits with ties are far morre lethal than tsotsi's at the corner of the street at night. May they contribute the R96 Million to NSFAS hehehehehehe That would be the best and most fulfilling piece of television! true 
56:27,58:56, The was never the Hawks. They were Zuma's informant. That is why nothing was done to MAGASHULE about the dairy MATTER. @Miranda Valashiya -i wonder where they so quiet? Hawks must be disbanded useless We need 5 days of cross examination for JZ. He's got a lot to answer. Though I know he'll deny everything Zuma will not deny anything thando. there will be a lot of throat clearing @Marvel Ramatshela too little time #David - 30 days will do?🤔 Zuma will speak and how I wished the Gptas speak as well 
59:06,1:04:00, I DONT KNOW ! I WAS NOT AWARE ! IM NOT SURE ! THAT IS WHAT JZ WILL SAY you all are moving too fast. when was it said that Zuma will take the stand?

Eish.Thats true @ Colanesh eishthis bantu 
1:04:10,1:05:35, now tell me nothing happened we must have had a blind president not being able to notice these serious issues My preconception comes from the fact that the Guptas landed on Waterkloof! lucky montana should come to testify also lol JZ needed to keep Guptas happy You can't land on Waterkloof without the clearance of the highest political office bearers! Tomorrow Solly Msimanga won't be a Mayor of Tshwane by the way...😃😃Politics lots ok K... in here
