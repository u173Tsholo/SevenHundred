Well done DCJ!!!! "@SanFran Arnold please dont generalise 
2:50:44,2:51:24, it wozn me @Ayanda 100% correct DCJ Zondo is connecting the dots for Gogo to concede that the board was wrong talking about CR you are waisting your time he went to Marikana commision and respected the Chairperson. what about Driekop @SanFran Arnold.
