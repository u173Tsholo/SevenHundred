50:58,58:02, @Mike Durban it is the leadership of the political parties i.e EFF that have set a precedent of being racist in the public. And unfortunately people take that to mean that they too can be racist @Rusty SpyGoat ....spot on.... @Anne M I mean they deal with the qualified reports catagotories lol @MIKE DURBAN we will have a situation in which people are attracted to gov posts for corruption purposes. We should have qualified and ethical people running gov. "@Anne M @Stronger together ......would not be surprised.....he is not a stable person........there is something funny about him...... @D Thomas And even DCJ is a bit confused by his statement.
