-3:45,-1:08, @ Granny Mokwena ​i She does not have them. She can not bring them because they implicate her. "The note will say ""I mean I am what I mean"" sick" where is she ? "she's already in a deep hole "Where are you? ""Lukkamien"" we are waiting." @Thandisizwe Yeleki ...Hiding in a dark corner. But I will find and sting her out ok Cannot believe that an advocate could have been so careless. just check if she did not hit a pole next to airport @Elvis Malakoane ....Maybe she drives a Toyota?

"After every sentence she is nevers as devil in the church Rob "at least someone told her to try and limit @ Dominic Przybylski I missed his wedding because I was too baabalazed and avoided travelling. He was a friend to a friend. "Maybe Im stupid The witness' smile was more like a smirk while she seemed to believe that no-one would be able to fathom the money laundering. The question still standing. When will all criminals who collapse the SOEs are going to be Prosecuted???????????? 
11:31,12:51, @emmanuel zungu same as Zuma....never "The more I watch Adv Kate Hoffmeyer the bigger the ""crush""gets....Am i the only one huh ??" how can a goernment official do not record her duties because i do not understand Miss Memela she says she does not remember her part of duties @Kevin I think she is HOT @Kevin She looks cute but she is lethal.

Love to know how many buttons on the dress she is wearing "Tell us whose big fish? You sounded as you know something "Did she say "" I mean"" at all today.?" she does sound nervous Adv .Kate Hoffmeyer is sensing all these lies of Miss Memela Her chest is full

Try Kokstad How did I miss that one @Phillip Cwazibe . kokstad I think i like that ndiyayithanda imibuzo kaKate Hoffmeyer "this lady has been trying to bring up BEE since last week 
28:09,30:35, @Elvis Malakoane ... I made the booking at Kokstad right now. I booked a Queen bed with an ensuite bathroom. Let me know if i need to change the booking class "haibo "Dont worry "@ Esme Van Heerden that is why she did not understand ""conflict of interest""" "She was fighting for Bee Morning all So the Zuma supporters say they are willing to die for him - they should be careful what they wish for - it might come true. Like I said is now prepared Kate will straighten it out before lunch I like that all the Zuma supporters are coming out of hiding - that way we know who we have to deal with. 
30:45,33:04, If I was Memela's lawyer I would tell her to shut up...ask for recess to be given handcuffs...put them on and re[port to jail... Adv Hofmeyer never disappoint she geared up for them A lot.... how can u die for... @Derek Main ...What I found interesting this weekend was the Invitee list for the PP's 50th birthday bash. not mch "I would think that someone who is a Lawyer & Advocate "No "" I mean "" lying more comfortably with her lawyer present.🤣🤣😃" "I don’t think they mean that what they do is threaten those who give evidence showing that they are supporting Zuma 
33:07,35:24, kunzima i would be terrified to sit opposite this lady in any boardroom pastor j who were among known suspectc at pp 50th Every known crook we know so far @Elvis Malakoane Will give you a list soon @Pastor J Morning Pastor - I didn't see that - let me Google first.

37:04,39:00, she is beginning to irritate me honestly she knows what she is doing wrong what a disgrace this woman is how can a lawyer ask the advocate to use simple English 😂😂😂 lol..simple one please @Pastor J Hmmm - very suspicious. Bongo beig there seems to confirm that she was indeed a spy before. she is much more aggressive in her replies this week Simple enough now Ms memela? Narcissistic "Esme I think we are going to see the ""dark side""of Kate very soon...." 
39:50,43:42, "Dali Mpofu Iyooo Memela she's trying to lead her evidence and this thing of her talking too much she forget some questions asks watch later in the day Adv Hofmeyer will make speak slower and rationally pastor j thanks sir @Pastor J Suppose it's not really a surprise. These ANC cadres are brazen in their criminality. You are very right @Derek Main don't advocates speak at the same level 😁 "Jacquie 
44:20,45:39, @Person of interest it seems so There's some arrogance about Ms Memela that I don't like. It's almost as if she doesn't want to submit herself to Ms Hoffmeyer's questions. how can she ask for an easier question - she is an advocate herself - she is acting stupid @Pheladi Lamola agree she is ARROGANT - full stop "Pheladi She's trying to do a Zuma on the crowd bringing her own advocate to raise objections pastor j I did not know that Mkhwebane is 50 I thought she is 60 or so she looks older 
45:42,51:05, Ooooh Yhoooooo "Here comes the ""Lukkamien"" again." It must be the stress levels@Elvis Malakoane "Very stressed Long answer which an honest person would simply answer yes or no - obfuscation. few like I mean today may be later floccinoccnihilipilification 👍 👍 😂 our current PP is 50 
52:11,1:00:09, So ... the GPUs were bought a year earlier and SAAT decided to get Swissport to do the job and then SAAT sold the GPUs to JM. who sold them to Swissport .... ??? no doubt SAAT lost out big time. Very beeeeeeeeg time @Lorna Kavanagh . And soon afterwards Ms Memela bought and paid for the house in Bedfordview "what's happening guys it's getting hot in here 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I SEE HIGH BLOOD THERE! And also very loooong stories.......Mmmmmmm... Never a yes...or a no........ Chaos 
1:00:11,1:03:13, Desperation setting in "Keep on smiling Memela What is attorney Mbanjwa saying. Memela is explaining the roundabout used by all these execs to disguise the reality of the transaction (theft). punching above your weight Ms lawyer... she is starting to sound like Sara lady at nugent enquiry Seems like this lawyer is just there to frustrate the process. lol Wow! 
1:03:35,1:05:58, Ms Hoffmeyer has had enough of this woman's nonsense @Derek Main i agree. Hofmeyer is frustrating the process Ms Memela though..... Hello @Pastor J @Eliot Chauke Very cute. stalling they are stalling because Ms Hofmeyer only finished 17 of her 31 issues on Fri and this lady says she needs to get to East London today and stated that it must not go over 3 hours ...... @Stronger together lol thats an insult to sumo wrestlers Eish things r heating up here no dull moment at all😰😰 
1:06:10,1:08:32, Judge Zondo educating an advocate. Is she not pressed for time anymore? I remember on Friday she said she could only avail herself for a specific period? Ms Memela you are making things worse for yourself if you continue to treat Ms Hofmeyr as public enemy No 1 @Pheladi Lamola I thought the same thing "Adv Memela is dealing with the questions nicely @Pheladi Lamola see my note Bev Daniels Memela wana assist... i like adv hoffmeyer Hofmeyet is selective and only focus on the Narrative 
1:08:34,1:10:06, @mandisi ntauzana Yes - Ms Memela is a consummate liar. I just saw it Bev. Thank you LOL @Derek Main you are being to harsh @mandisi ntauzana and @Eliot Chauke Did you listen to the evidence on Friday? GM @Bev Daniels The HOFF is going to put these two lawyers in a corner nobody can get out of. @Pastor J same to you hope your day is fantastic this lady is super guilty GM @anya van loggerenberg 
1:10:10,1:10:49, "@mandisi ntauzana I don't think so - she has got ""crook"" written all over her. Any ANC cadre in procurement is almost certainly corrupt." Condolences @Stronger together Gm#Person of interest i ddnt watch on Friday Kate is spitting fire now Stronger together My condolences sir sorry to hear. My condolences @Stronger together "Kevin yes "@Kevin 
1:11:16,1:12:57, "AS my son is called Kevin as well @Eliot Chauke Ms Mamela isn't as innocent as you think. Listen to Friday's evidence later if you can. Awume @Derek Main what feature is Adv Memela's look is similar or looks like a crook? Even I would be annoyed at the stupid interjection Kevin's surname is Hofmeyr If i am your son Bev then you would be 85 years old plus some 😂 @Elvis Malakoane ...Sorry friend but for some reason I do not see the chats from stronger together. What happened bro? @mandisi ntauzana It's the ducking and diving and unwillingness to just answer questions and the continuous smiling at the chair as if it is all a joke to her. @Pastor J - his dad passed away 
1:13:19,1:17:54, Pastor j his dad passed away and they had a funeral on Friday "@Kevin This advocate is talking absolute BS "Will someone please pass my Love Take charge Chair Pastor j do that for u now @Stronger together @Pastor J passes on his love and prayers Ms Memela is going to be in big trouble as Cyril Ramaphosa has passed new rules in the Commissions can and cannot do????? Bev Daniels and those amendments cane at the right time 
1:18:18,1:20:37, The Commission has been running 18 months...17 of them this morning Bev what has Cyril done....in a few words ??? I do not think that Ms. Memela knew that there is a submission by the CEO. She is going to need an ambulance now. "It came about the same day the ""warrant of Arrest"" was issued @Elvis Malakoane" "@Elvis Pastor j yes I think arrest festivals are starting what clause? GM @Amanda Watson @Phillip Cwazibe and GM and my apolgies to anyone I missed greeting this morning. "If people do not want to answer questions or step out of line
