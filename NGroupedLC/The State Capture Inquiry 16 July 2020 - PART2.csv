time,34:13,message wow It just sounds like lots of money to me and lots of accusations SABC News: Always questioning but in my opinion THE BEST hello This can't be a commission of inquiry into state capture it's a commission to remove ZUMA's colleagues (Indians) and replace it with RAMAPHOSA's (white monopoly capitalists) stop lying ndlovu zondi that's the reality Fana 
34:34,37:07, SA will soon face the music zondo is not ramaphosa minister or anc cre deployed okay one day you will remember my logic u wish if zuma corrupt let him face the music and defend himself and the gupta's true Boyabenyatsi yes ammie we have long ago faced the music & will continue to do so as long as we play the race game. u benefitted nothing from zuma only corruption and not admit to reality & who are the people that continue to sell us out. we have to save ourself .tuangamize corona 
37:28,42:14, who is not corrupt in South Africa? let him rise up "yeah the ANC only indians become zuma friends when it comes to money remember schaik Indian now gupta's Indian also what about blacks we don't know money or we don't want money think smart chief tomorrow SA Will be like Zimbabwe if you think it's only Mr. Zuma who was corrupt then your brains is corrupted forget that's what Zuma wanted Zimbabwe chief i still say think smart chief two wrong don't make right SA is still struggling today wasting money conducting these useless commissions. RAMAPHOSA BOUGHT A RHINO FOR R18 million 
42:17,45:39, this guys body language just looks questionable looks very on edge "just leave Mr. Zuma alone business man bought a rhino not from state money but McDonald money private company nkambuke debate me not my house or family nkambule stop hating Mr. Zuma and focus on yourself read about how RAMAPHOSA started NUM how Mbeki looted Zimbabwe minerals how Ramaphosa lost the opportunity to lead SA TO Zuma "if any one of you who are smart unduly benefitted from tax payers money 
46:32,48:00, How many millions had been used already for this commission? I don't Guys. what we need to appreciate as Africans is that our economies are indirectly controlled either by the Western countries or the Eastern countries. The corruption we see in Africa is induced by the point is both Zuma and Ramaphosa gvts are full of amasele outside forces. "hey The Anc government had caused us. I don't umsholozi infact i was one of the people who voted for him in polokwane nkambule 
48:02,49:36, Zondo is also captured How is it normal that SA's reserve bank is privately owned and that most of its shareholders are not South African? Zuma was corrupt @Lebogang Maseje - the epitome of corruption u wish again fo zondo to be captured Theodore you have a point "if Mr Zuma is corrupt then why and who killed Agrizzi investors own the banks 
50:10,53:26, banks not THE RESERVE BANK who killed agrizzi nomvula SA is one of the few 6 countries world wide with a reserve bank that is privately owned reserve bank or banks is the same investors own both focus on the facts nkambule the true is all these gvts are captured and they act holy. today the same guys with money in SA have deliberately led SA into a shocking 84% to GDP debt. this is bad The Queen of England is a shareholder in the Reserve bank of SA. Germany is also a major shareholder. and you call it a state even rupert's own reserve bank 
53:58,57:01, Playing our Africa's second biggest economy like a casino Oppenheimer Rothschild That is why wealth redistribution in SA will be a very difficult thing to achieve. very powerful people indirectly own and controll this country floyd shivambu friends the Oppenheimer Theodore John â€‹The Queen of England is a shareholder in the Reserve bank of SA. Germany is also a major shareholder.... is it also Mr. Zuma? was he responsible for this? stellenbosch brigade sg floyd shivambu limenemene lotata @nkambule is very easy to be connected if you are an influential politician. 
57:08,1:00:17, incompetent employees killed SAA zuma is not in the league of powerful business leaders zuma is head boy from nkandla but that's where corruption is...Fana Nkosi â€‹zuma is not in the league of powerful business leaders And why hasn't it changed. the reserve bank of SA is the oldest central bank in Africa founded in 1921. why hasn't it been nationalized till now. what's stopping the government from.? eh ehe ehe ehe i don't trust him Fana Nkosi â€‹zuma is head boy from nkandla.... nyalo -ke sowuyanya state cupture and arms deal waiting zuma ungathukani nkambule 
1:00:34,1:02:53, rampant theft and fraud from politicians is preventing nationalisation of reserve bank. we don't need to convict Zuma coz Ramaphosa will soon follow are u also from nkandla Fana Nkosi â€‹state cupture and arms deal waiting zuma ... and you will get the shock of your life thieves in charge zuma is my cde iam just giving u facts yeap Apache Fana Nkosi â€‹ungathukani nkambule...nawe ungadzeleli Gucci revolutionaries have looted the country beyond recognition. 
1:03:42,1:08:17, true especially the new dawn of Ramaphosa unamanga only u true Bheki Fana uthini In the words of Smuts Ngonyama : I did not join the struggle to be poor. ANC looting and keeping the money for themself who will replace the ANC? who is calling the shots in SA government comes and goes all over the world 
1:08:21,1:11:23, "who is president? Cyril "@Fana Nkosi  white monopoly We need to ensure that we have franchised voters who can't be bought with a food hamper and a t shirt otherwise we are beyond help monopoly on theft and looting ANC cadres the ANC is franchising criminality....

Suggest to take private matters offline to another forum. It is very distracting 
1:17:36,1:21:14, Delegated. Such a handy word. DEZZ001 DA might win because black ppl are tired of the ANC they wont vote at all Sales Abdulla respect us please. Sal just stick to the program please Abdulla anc is my party ndlovu DA LIFE "@Melor Hadebe The DA is a spent penny with Helen back 
1:21:18,1:25:05, Can the commission please bring that Auditor who didnâ€™t do due diligence in this regard? I used to support it but ANC = ZANU PF but u said u are da stay with or join mashaba I don't trust revolutionary political parties Exactly the reason why our country loses billions. Our People are conned and side tracked. "I still respect and salute Mr.Zuma our struggle fighter nkambule now its mistake when billionaire are given to the gupta's and duduzane how much was given to the youths of nkandla only to Zuma's son and his partners

1:32:13,1:33:23, look at Johannesburg what they did to Mashaba zille is briefing u correctly "....@Tony ANC is known for politicizing governance issues For me Mr. Zuma was my first black president it is unfortunate that people believed everything they were told by media I still say if they had a proof of any thing to send him to jail... mashaba left because of madam zille he said so himself not anc he could have long gone to prison but they have nothing. Thank you Nxamalala Fana..Anc had promised everyone will get a RDP house... 26 years later why have they not done it! Look at all the municipalities that had failed with the annual audits? China got.fourty two.counntrie in AFRICA JUST ONOTHER COUTRY 
1:33:36,1:38:33, @Melor Hadebe Touche despite that ANC is behind all these developments the ANC is the black jesus to some yet the so called liberators are the biggest looters of this country. MR. PULE MOTHIBA HAS NO CONFIDENCE IN WHAT HE IS TESTIFYING. WHY? viva zuma court Billy downer is waiting fo him schabir is first witness fo the state i hope u know that BoRiNG PWC Jou lekker ding Who was the Corporate Governance Officer of SAA? That would have exposed this looting. ZUMA WILL JUST GET NEW SICK NOTE 
1:40:55,1:52:51, eh eh eh... hmmm ðŸ¤¥ Haha! Listen to this guy panicking PWC must be held accountable for this behavior Nolan 100% but who did the half year audit? This PWC auditor doesn't know what he is talking about. It's so obvious that he is hiding something. SUBCIBE DEZZ001 LOVING LIFE SUBCRIBE.ALL THE FACTS Mr Zondo always have a excuse with aircon and lighting wasting the Tax payers money not completing the process. All the giggling? Are reported irregularities in awarding tenders a laughing matter? May the law take its course against those found guilty of squandering tax payers money. 
1:53:56,2:10:57, Everybody claim UIF Wouldn't it be nice to get this thing moving at a walking pace rather than crawling long the way it has been going for the last 2 years? Exactly. The slower it takes the more lawyers earn. Auditors and lawyers are obviously in competition to see who can lie and get away with the lie? In both cases they get paid exorbitant amounts but bear no responsibility for the outcome a ANC PWC man? If you work for PWC you have to sign a declaration of truth. The anc must fall! "ANC should be ANL I would have... why did you not do it sir? 
2:11:17,2:14:42, "how much money has been spent on this inquiry? how many arrests have been made by SAPS whats the purpose of this Inquiry? is it another TRC? Democracy is one of the biggest political scams. Illusion of choice. Wake up! Yourll sit by and let governments do all this corruption. We must stand together against corruption. 100% you have TO declare any irregularities PWC Those rdp houses already fell down years ago. what changed? Anc only cares about stealing money. We need a white government. @TheTruthShall SetYouFree really ? disappointed This person is babbling and he's nervous... which would suggest ..that he's most likely guilty of fraud.... crime is crime 
2:15:01,2:18:47, we once had a White municipality before it was killing ppl remember Who are the honest people in government? will we ever know? jail time Mr PWC "@Easy D not really @ chimbuzi1 .. point taken.... I'm not even white but I know white government will do a much better job. FACT. "But Chair "@TheTruthShall SetYouFree did not accuse you of being white You have to declare all irregularities 
2:19:21,2:22:15, How could this government let crime rate become the highest in the world? The african race was not ready to lead this country. Many african politicians worked hard but there's too much corruption @TheTruthShall SetYouFree who are the parties to corruption? is it only the public sector ? Anc is corrupted @TheTruthShall SetYouFree crime is crime "Look at how many people trusted Jacob Zuma "@Hubert Maphumulo pls turn up the volume is mothiba and member or all black executives ate anc members even pwc partners anc member Did he sign the audit off? 
2:22:16,2:25:23, Obviously! You should bloody know by now that the entire global society is run by unholy people. Human society is heavily influenced by demonic forces. If you dont know this then you sleeping What? @TheTruthShall SetYouFree but only the ANC/BLACK government is Demonic according to your logic This person did not follow the protocols in regarding tendering contracts... which ask another question.. why...? You see people like to sin and they many are comfortable being slaves to money so some may actually fight to protect the corrupted economic system. Greed won for too long. Pray. body language we need structural policital and economic reform are you preaching 
2:26:46,2:30:03, "warm bodies have hid behind juristic entities for too long yes Majority of humanity doesn't even know the situation we are in. There is spiritual war going on all the time He works for PWC... why can he not answer these questions? Mr Moshiba playing confused! "People care more about pop culture and ""celebrity"" news. People are not aware to what is really happening on Earth." we need to do away with jusristic entities ASAP! Its why only a few people witness miracles "The evil humans use black magic 
2:31:42,2:36:43, "Witchcraft We have allowed ourselves to distracted by the shiny things of the world "The deliverable list requires all GL accounts Oh! What A Tangled Web We Weave When First We Practice To Deceive. "No man .. The mass deception is happening now. When you realise what governments are really like I dont how you can just ignore it 100% It should be yes PWC 
2:36:50,2:40:25, The red tape is always there. Our government makes sure that smmes are not getting a fair chance You know demon forces lie to people just so that they can get people to do horrible things so then the demon forces make that person rich or whatever. Its all made to make human fall from grace Is this scapegoating? A demon deal will make a person seem like they have magical powers but in reality that person has caused separation from heaven and the demon is the one who actually rules that person Very very easy for ANC to do lots of Magic......the Bra's like to be Spellbound......na "Why does he keep on looking at the ceiling "Luna lol... Why do you think evil magic practitioners have to do horrible things? Its because the demons hate humanity and by influencing humans to do evil things that person will lose The Lord's favour. Wake up. 
2:40:53,2:43:46, lol or if its painted.. "You must stop sinning. The Lord is holy True U believe in fairytale His junior colleagues has been under the impression he is boss. hahahahahah lol... ðŸ˜‚ Hubert yes Unless you experience you wont believe. Many people fall for the deception of evil spirits because they see the works of the evil spirits. 
2:44:10,2:49:30, Thugs are running the world lying lying catching up with him Seeing is believing mos Chair dont sleep can you please follow? This one must have been summoned. He can't have come here of his own volition "So why was it not followed up Mmmmm......the Bra.......was seeing Dollars everytime he blinked........ INCOMPETENCE 
2:49:33,2:51:08, @TheTruthShall SetYouFree .........true...but Everyone is responsible for their own actions........ Demons hate the truth. "This life is about the choices we make. Heaven wants us to be holy. The Lord is holy The Advocates performance is a thing of beauty. "Gavin "That is a lie A joy to behold "She THIS COUNTRY IS GOVERNED BY INCOMPETINCY 
2:51:19,2:54:57, People think that there's no such thing as morality so they dont feel guilty about sinning but deep down many always feel bad after sinning. Where is Pastor J when I need him? What 60% "Luna Majority of people side with the devil He was paid to pay no attention lols "I guarantee that majority of people dont know how powerful humans can really become. It all comes from The Lord "Yes 
2:56:01,2:58:26, Oops ...ðŸ¤¢ If everyone on Earth becomes holy we can rehabilitate this Earth and create a utopia. But the prophecies were given for a reason. So I just got to try and expose people to the truth. No procedure No attention Your gotta make your own effort though No Effort either "You don`t have to REMEMBER the truth "See you tomorrow bye bye Mmmmhhhhh. This guy is in for it.
