Interesting times ahead 😁 have a lovely day my fellow south africans very proffesional indeed @Ryan - they fled in fear of their lives let alone the fluency why is he wearing glasses if he doesnot use them to read 
14:30,20:31, zondo maybe he is not short sighted but long sighted Morning... Why are you asking @Ryan Smith? @fikile mbokodi He is short sighted and his glasses are for that problem. With age we also become long sighted and he should wear bifocals or (as he does) he takes off his glasses. I do the same if I'm not wearing bifocals. Yes @Ryan Smith. But work commitments make it difficult to catchup okay thanks @Anne M. My work also requires that I travel around the country and work long hours@Ryan Smith.

Make them break stones Sarah Briton you need to chill...is your child not Indian? "Dillon ""The Dog"" Jonathan blocked" @keith Farr . I agree. This race bating from both sides is surely regarded as hate speech and should be prosecuted? Dillion you have been reported - Id encourage all participants to do the same.

1:47:16,1:52:07, "@Rob Nel I like 'pie' Is this witness implicated or will implicate someone? What is his status? waiting to hear his status @Sindiswa Moolman Hofmeyer is not into tension: She is already sniffind at unadjudicated tender being treated as if it was approved. Thanks @Norman Zwane and @Mike Moja @Sindiswa Moolman It's a big pond she is fishing in I must concede. VBS Heist: Brian Shivambu ordered to repay R1.78m (IOL) Memorial service of Gavin Watson He needs to pay more than that @Mzalwane Mzala. 
1:52:15,1:55:38, The liquidator of the VBS Mutual Bank has been granted an order by the Johannesburg High Court to recoup R1.78 million from Brian Shivambu for the loan he obtained from the bank (IOL) @makhosi nobhatyi Is it just a service or is there a dead body around? Step by step @Sindiswa Moolman Hope so... @Mzalwane Mzala "@ Mzalwane Mzala why Shivambu is paying money? The man denied that so I don’t understand @Mzalwane Mzala Is that not the brother being disowned? @ Norman Zwane I don’t know really "He only paid R1m towards the loan Ityala aliboli @makhosi nobhatyi 
1:55:55,1:59:03, I think it has to do with a loan he got for a business venture in Soweto @makhosi nobhatyi @Norman Zwane. It has nothing to do with the R16m that went to EFF. "I really admire this level of openness @Sindiswa Moolman is right @Norman Zwane A loan in respect of which there is no intention to repay is also known as THEFT!!! "@makhosi nobhatyi I don't know about you "@ Mzalwane Mzala 😂😂😃 the boy now realize that we are not playing anymore want our money back 😳😳 decides to pay Brian Shivhambu threatened to sue advocate Motau for accusing him and he never did. Openness that is not reflected in any movement of arrests of these crooks @Sindiswa Moolman I appreciate the enlightment. 
1:59:27,2:05:37, Welcome @Norman Zwane "@makhosi nobhatyi If the watsons would also say ""UYABONWA"" 🤣🤣🤣the brother is paging up and down This flapping of paging is annoying "The law makes progress @Mike Moja Most lawyers only ask questions they know answers to only on the stand. I suspect the brother is caught coz I think Hofmeyer knew all along that the thing is nowhere in the submission. whats this %&*())^%$£ @norman zwane 🤣🤣🤣✋ thanks 
2:06:24,2:11:20, "Is flipping of pages a ""strategy"" like batting out for a draw in cricket ? Any examples in law ?" hiiii hiiii 😃 Deon February😎😂😂😂 @Deon February 😂 I bet this guy is not coming back after lunch. @Deon February He going to choke on a bone you think? @Deon February 🤣😭 the brother is not coping well 
2:14:00,2:19:31, Don’t tell me that we have another implicated Chartered Accountant. Hope not. "I thought ""struggle bookkeeping"" was a thing of the past - silly me 🤣" @Sindiswa Moolman Auditors and Accountants have not done well in this commission. They all tend to have a lapse of truthfulness at the most crucial moments in their duties. "hello to all my bantus 😂😂😂😂😂😂 "Zuma 😂😂 u should not let bantus manage this women looks Caucasians but she is hotentots
