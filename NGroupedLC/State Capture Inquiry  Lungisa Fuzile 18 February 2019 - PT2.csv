15:59,18:53, you can tell this is not a lair hahahaha why do u always have to bring race into everything...very mature dude These guys were doing a Iqbal Surve regarding this nuclear deal. Calculating the nuclear price from R10. hendre you listen with a skin not with ears rofl I meant R10 exchange rate to the dollar mr nene also was in this "Because this man is being open and critical of the ex president. You say he’s covering up for the ex president. So which means you’re not listening. And as a black person thulani this man is listening with skin nt with ears 
19:14,21:03, just remember 1thing the richest man in the world is Putin The real lesson the Commission is teaching us and I think the youth should listen is how not to run a government Yes @Fuzile. I agree bro. 👋🏾 Ethical people who were leading critical institutions were made to quit....this guy Lungile Fuzile must come back @Dumile Mateza craziest; this is street econmics gone way out wrong! We r no where nearer to that even now... That's misleading Viva MI16 party it should not happen

23:25,26:19, "@Bongani Maqabuka we are there as Eskom is buckling under a R450b debt The discussion is becoming academic now how could the Rand strength with Zuma in charge at the time. in 1970 it was about R1 = $3 but those days are gone long time ago. @Eslon Eslon we are dealing with technical stuff now.. @Dumile Mateza I can't agree with U more! in the 1960's the Rand Pound was the same. big question was why they going to Russia and not local. No trust in local work force. @Michael Wild 1970? Felix just stating 
26:20,28:21, in mid 80's i got $2 for R1. weren't the guptas also buying and saling currencies Great Stuff....this state attorney is too sharp... "Thats why when dealing with a currency like ours @DEREK....spot on @Derek Govender are you saying MYANC must be arrested? @Derek i agree Dumile nit in 1970.SA was independent but not free for all. no matter how stable the african country can be its currency will always below the dollar/pound..jrrrrrrrr what is this? 
28:36,31:05, so the guy says nothing about Maria's collusion on the Rand the evidence that need to be interrogated Sir Maleka knows his job "Listening to the NPA inquiry @Derek Govender I like Maleka "Exactly @Thando Nkutha - It doesn't matter that you can buy instruments to protect yourself from Rand/Dollar volatility @Eslon...spot on sure Mr Govender its agreed but not to the fullest for now Adv. Maleka in the house!! 
31:30,34:31, I am no economist nor an expert on currencies but the pula will remain weak to the dollar because it is tagged to the rand and the pula is not traded internationally. only problem is that in this instance nothing is/ was normal Come on now...they wanted the Nuclear deal at all costs.......ie. Dollars in their pockets. Think about it. "At the time "@Dumile Mateza  They knew full well what they were doing...... Pula is not pinned to the rand You are risk averse @Thando Nkutha "1 usd = 10 
34:39,36:20, South Africa is a democratic kleptocracy. If you don't speculate....you don't accumulate... Mr President will you please return vat to 14%🤔🤔 1usd = R14 Maybe R20...after elaections...let's see.... "what about petrosa I dont blame you @Thando Nkutha Zuma telling Mps how to do there work like a dictator Morgan Freeman - splitting image 
36:30,38:16, """..the job of the finance minister is to find the money.."" JZ" Puseletso Loape VAT is the only way to get EVERY South African to contribute to tax income @Thando...never play with your bread money.. @Jones Parker Botswana is part of the Southern African Customs Union and because the pula despite being tagged to the rand. Two years ago i bout $700 for R9659. It is not a internationally traded currency as a result it is not affected by the violatility the rand is subjected to. "😂😂😂poor Zuma Play with money you can afford to loose etc... @Thando...spot on 
38:31,43:10, @Dumile Mateza thanks for the free education "Hey that rocket scientist mabuza now also want to split saa into 3..this must be the new bosasa scheme he's proposing domestic Let's say I speculate a little.. "Zonda @Thando...spot on. was Brown not She @John_ Is okay to lose your own money but if you lose somebody else's money that is normally treated as theft. free education? 
44:35,47:37, """whatucallthisthingnow...."" legal opinion." open cheque book Unfortunately we are force to give our money via tax to these people in cabinet who have no qualifications and know nothing about what they are doing. Brown in National Treasury @Michael Wild not the former minister @Thando Nkutha yas call a thing a thing Thanks Molefe still believes nuclear is the best option @Domonic Przybylski i hope you are not saying that because the majority of them in cabinet are black I'm enjoying both the evidence leader and the witness. Their level of intelligence is pretty impressive 
48:05,52:34, I have no faith in any politicians. They are politicians because they cannot do anything else. He was a lawyer. Probably cannot even fix a leaking tap in his home. The haste that zuma was driving this nuclear deal indicated total disregard by the powers of the future of this country as compared to their own benefits. @Dumile @Domonic can we be less sensitive how did it get to black or white as Dominic was referring to incompetence here's Fuzile highly competent Need stricked jail terms for people in the top. And a separate department to manage that. And government should not have the power to change them. like removing the scorpions. We need a form of government where we don't need politicians. They are the most useless people in society. This one was too clever to be corrupted and captured It's coming. People don't understand what is going to happen with 4th Industrial Revolution. "Zuma 80% at cabinet was his supporters so it was easy approved anything he wanted 
52:35,56:20, this politicians think they are entitled to our money We will be governed better by robots. If they break a promise we can send them back to the factory and ask for a refund. Dominic....not in this Life Never say never. @Dominic Przybylski LOL Intelligent and articulate what happens after inquiry This guy is honest and frank I like that @Dominic they will program the poor robot to accept bribes these people are out of control 
57:16,59:20, The best thing about robots is they don't need to get laid or feel the need to eat caviar and drink champagne. how? cause they bribe IEC? I Like the term battalions this guy is BOSS Wow...👏👏👏👏 Battalions of experts. Atleast I learn a new word today Politics must not dominate more than Technical expertise...I fully agree A batallion of experts!😂😂😁😁 @Dominic you are something else but you are correct I've already said they should seriously think of a robot parliament 
59:38,1:02:31, Terrible that people of this mans calibre are hounded out of public service! THIS LAWYER SEEMS TO BE SO HAPPY EVERY TIME I SEE HIM Politician's job is easiest white-collar job to automate. "You can not be the Manager @Peter only crooks get ahead in these hostile environments if you are principled forget it they will work you out I reckon All politicians should go through a vetting and a character or something like that .. "@thembisa Yep @precious but bhuti jomo is excellent Even Mr Advocate Zondo seems very impressed with these two guys 👊🏾 
1:02:32,1:05:20, Yes who was the compliance officer in Goverment As SAns we dismally failed to demonstrate skills and capability to manage politics and governance when we are in power.Periods We expect to much from politics. "what is the difference between white collar crime "My ears are happy..to hear someone speaks clear Lungisa Fuzile and Mkhuseli Apleni.....Best DGs we have ever had. Cavalier attitude This guy must be given the reserve bank job if the current governor step down @Mike lock a simple psychometric test can reveal a myriad of sins many are psychopaths 
1:05:54,1:07:42, A Quick question how is he implicated ? OR is he not ? Eslon eslon🤣🤣🤣🤣 Our politicians get their support from people who cannot look after themselves and who think somebody else will do it for them. "@Zanele "@Sofia @Precious Ntshangase ahhh thank you hun Sofia the tsotsis are done testing meaning Agrizzi and the rest 🤣🙈 Mr Fuzile for president very learned man

So his belief is valid personal beliefs aside.... IF he actually does "I do believe that there is witchcraft Edward Zuma uphi coz he defend his father until the end 
1:10:26,1:12:02, "Some people believe in witchcraft 154 Billion on WHAT ? 14 @makhosi..someone stole his English Dictionary. He is struggling to put sentences together.

And second point Sofia 70% of the engineers are from SA. also the architects. they had to leave due to AA The real legacy of apartheid is a lack of self-esteem amongst so many people. If you don't believe in yourself the it's easy for corrupt politicians to make you believe in them. Don't attack me if assumption is your only thing ! @Michael Wild "van rooyen sorry did not mean to. rather discuss it. @Michael Wild thats ok ... not everything a person says should be taken in bad light agree
