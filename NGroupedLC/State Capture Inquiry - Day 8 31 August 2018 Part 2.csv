I just don't see how our visions could be aligned at this point. 
1:11:17,1:12:45, BORING!!! the witnesses prior to this were just talkingabouttheir observations and whatthey were offered and didnt do. They never pointed a finger at any person where that person could be charged @Martin Havinga I MUST HAVE HIT A NERVE IF I HIT A NERVE ITS THE TRUTH YOU DONT ACCEPT STUPID isn't it like when they said apartheid is legal when they engaged in such societal structure practices. they had made it into law after they captured SA. "Some of us like to know what the State Capture actually is We have never had a case of State capture before. This will set a precedence. @jeneva batten Thank you. That's exactly what they're saying. Sockpuppets don't have nerves..... "@Orefile Macheoane this is true I agree withyou. The public is here hoping to find outwho did what.. so far 
1:13:17,1:15:06, that's called ignorance. they are making great points and making a great case to make all those thugs that's been stealing from all of SA pay they are giving us a great foundation to fight back. otherwise this has been a case of the blind leading the blind.

1:51:02,1:52:06, nah africans leaders BAN MARCUS GARVEY @Steemit OneAzania i don't need to ok in other words you can't big up unoself Black N Eazy...unpacking black consciousness @ an international level...big up the grand master teacher of black race...marcus mosiah garvey Biko is a prodigy of Marcus Garvey This Commission is sending a message to the world that SA is serious about fighting corruption @Nduduzo Zondi till all Africans are utterly free @Blak N Eazzy I added you on twitter and I sent you a friend request on Facebook IT DONT WANT TO EFFECT THEM 
1:52:11,1:53:08, must salute south africa for this freedom of speech. lacking in most of our african countries cool @iAmBlackHouston we'll link up @Blak N Eazzy notat all. Biko was not influenced by Garvey directly. YOu should study biko's papers a bit @Floyd Mathebula impossible. Whites will never accept us as human beings. Racism is as old as life itself. black defining themselves by propagating for African nationalismis not new but everytime it failed because it turns to backfire with time ignorance loves company @Steemit OneAzania i live by it . @Blak N Eazzy I'm listening to you on ReverbNation now

Are you related to Phumla @Thiza William ? @Blak N Eazzy when you can defien black people tell me Biko the product of Garvey works....African decolonization the product of Garvey ideologies...really shook the west...including christianity... 
1:55:52,1:56:54, During decolonisation process in Africa. note what happened after liberation. Once whites left we turned against each other based on tribal affiliation yeap they need to discredt it yeap you use the words black people a lot. and african people at home and abroad. but what do you mean by it This bull about black must end Define black people???? you must a Euro-asian/European they tried @Thiza William youare right but When Biko said Black he was not using race @Thiza William What are you talking about? 
1:57:05,1:57:44, Wars in the post-independent Africa as a result of divide & rule scheme of the wets conclueds the racism chat Afrika till all Afrikans are economically independent A commission just like the public protector does not prosecute. About blackness as an anti racist he meant something different. The problem is the current use of this word is despicable I agree with you to white americans get it right What's wrong with Blackness? @Thiza William Marcus Harvey was a disaster just learn more about him 
1:57:54,1:58:44, Garvey Tribalism is a disease @Thiza William Are you white or Black? I love Marcus Garvey. @Thiza William you are the disaster for even thinking that @Thiza William the term is still necessary but only in a situation where peopel are honest abouttheir inferiorotyy and stop clinging to race as defined by apartheid you need some mental surgency...diagnosis @Thiza... monday no racism debate @Nduduzo Zondi True "It is never ""a waste of time"" to draw from the knowledge of experts."
