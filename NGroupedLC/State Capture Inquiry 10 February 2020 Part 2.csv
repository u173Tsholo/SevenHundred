10:33,13:06, boom deeper.... "Her lawyer is with her today boom Anne M listen carefully the dance is starting "anyone seen any mems of this ladies face  🤔 @Elvis Malakoane 😃 I did not agree with it legally? 
13:39,17:08, my lunch is over Bombs are going off fat lady is about to sing "LikeImean "Yes or No ZAP BOOM BAM 🔥 This was a thinly disguised money skimming system. RET in action? please can anyone confirm if this is part of state capture? It appears to me that this is a transaction that should have been subjected to audit (internal and external) That false smile makes me want to puke. this is such fun to watch 
17:29,21:41, it's a nervous tic Answering in riddles 🤣🤣 D Thomas it falls within the terms of reference of the commission so yes part of state capture Is she smiling or is she showing her teeth? She will start coughing shortly ala Zuma. @D Thomas One of many corrupt transactions. The Auditor General has issued many qualified audit reports which have been ignored. Eish flu Elvis thanks but my understanding of state capture is where the activities of state were severely influenced to almost inability to act in the interest of the country D Thomas yes Tom your understanding is not wrong and this deal they did did exactly what you say 
21:48,25:26, "Anne "SAA down the tubes because of this kind of activity anyone remind me what role she help and who she is related too ? "@D Thomas the NPA was also captured She was implicated by previous witnesses. @Gareth Morgan she was the previous Head of Procurement at SAA Technical She is making sure all these people are called "@Anne M. thanks  No longer at SAA. She's an admitted advocate so might be practising in that capacity 
25:45,28:29, Anne thanks for your response but my concern is that the penalty for state capture in some countries is death. What was one unit resell value. if someone knows. @D Thomas Are you South African? We don't have the death penalty in this country. "what are you grinning about "Eat her "In SA no punishment. Guilty  "Ooooo Mamela Ms Hofmeyer is irritable. Do you blame her? 
28:39,29:35, @funicanz its MRS I checked 😞 The Hoff is brilliant "Irritated @Anne M. I wish I can rip off her head thing. R400 000 per GPU siphoned off to corruption. how many got sold. 12 "what a poor witness wow 
29:42,30:58, Adv Hofmeyer klap daai vroumens sy speel dom @Lex .....and aggressive. Snotklap @Michael Wild The resale value at the time was approx. at 6 to 7 million rand and just for fact the bee partner sold them at 9 million to a Swiss based company @Elvis Malakoane You're right Yes Judge Zondo!!! @Sam Monkoe spot on thanks for the clarity "on this bee deal about 4 she picked the wrong people to try and bamboozle today 
31:10,33:04, No problem Does this woman think we are all as thick as she is? she don't ...i mean...i mean today "@Gareth Morgan  Oh here comes the lawyer again. Ugh. @funicanz 😃 "@D Thomas That the culprits will eventually be prosecuted @D Thomas the ultimate objective is to prevent the destruction of our country's economy. reARview price 
33:35,36:02, That is for tax purposes not items value. "@Lex Luger​ Accounting and Asset register is not that complicated If it continues our country will become a failed state where nothing works and will end up in mass starvation and total breakdown of society - permanent state of civil war like in DRC/Somalia. "@Paul Buchel I believe that future is not in our lifetime "Anne We won't recover much at all but we may be able to save our country. The dragon will now be blowing fire. "Funicanz & Gareth Morgan.- Miss means she is not married 
36:24,37:32, Dominic the prevention of destruction of the country is to put effective controls in place "just got in The rot and corruption has to stop in order to save our economy. We may not recover enough money to cover the cost of the commission but the corrupt characters have been identified. We have the controls but they are ignored. "@Lex Luger​ @David Tuer eish wena ! step off ! like I said is getting tired. judge please ask her to answer the question. "@David Tuer  The experimental- Welcome back. 
37:46,38:50, @thembidlamini thembidlamini Attorney/Advocate Mbanjwa @Gareth Morgan . 😉 Anne cheers. Appreciate engaging with you. take care of yourself You too We have a great constitutions and all the controls are specified but there is no implementation/enforcement so they are not worth the paper they are written on. "thanx Phillip "@Paul Buchel Not likely sw.vor.haf "Adv Hoffmeyr is struggling here 
38:59,41:54, I agree with Paul ...Zuma will pay "Crisp honest answer please Ms Memela @ thembidlamini thembidlamini ​thanx is she part of the Zuma faction? Answer is angazi but ungena aphume ezintangeni. the witness will sell her granny for a penny Book Value will be the value in the asset register and Adv Hoffmeyr know that they dont have a valid register. Crisp answers? Dominic thanks. That means we have a much bigger problem that requires a comprehensive review and decisive action its tricky Phillip Yes or NO. 
42:21,45:24, Is she for real?? Mandisi if you buy a car and three years later want to sell it. you ask the Bank what the book value is. and then you go out to market to try get a better price because the car was well looked after. What a joke! All lies!!! "stealing the taxpayer’s money is the order of the day We have a 'democratic' government controlled by SACP who have never recieved a single vote and by the trade unions and think a communist economy is the answer when it has destroyed every country which tried it. Dominic thanks for your kind responses. Well noted. Cheers Ooooo here comes mommy to help..... We are a kleptocracy not a democracy 
46:16,49:27, "@Michael Wild FMV and BV are different things The real conflict is between communism and capitalism and race has been used to confuse the issue. Read the document then tailor you story. Sit down! Asset value and market value are unrelated. The asset value is the depreciated value i.e the purchase value which is reduced by a tax allowance.The market value is what someone will pay for it. Every witness that solicit intervention of their legal representation usually have lots to hide DCJ Zondo you Boss Sidney p you very correct stealing is not punished in South Africa and no one is in prison!!!! 
49:43,54:06, "oh boy It's not about black vs white. It is simply that people must be appointed on merit not skin colour. who is this woman which position eshe is holding @hlengani khuvutlu she is the lawyer of this Memela woman. There are corrupt incompetent people in every race. Unfortunately BEE and cadre deployment means that competence is not the most important factor. @hlengani khuvutlu ​who is this woman which position eshe is holding= Attorney or Advocate Mbanjwa representing Ms. Memela. paid on behalf of her mother my foot @JS Bach this mamela woman which position she is holding If we don't have competent honest people in control of our country our country cannot succeed. 
54:28,55:29, Was the Head of Procurement at SAA Technical. She's no longer at SAA. @hlengani khuvutlu True Would be interesting to know how SARS feels about all these shady purchase and sale agreements and .......... "Sadly @Phillip Cwazibe this malmela woman which position she is coming from @Rory Lee Farnham Barak Obama Hopefully SARS has someone sitting at the commission disguised as a journalist 😉 @Pastor J Its called scan and email lady did jm have the money before they received payment from the contract 
55:39,57:11, @Rory Lee Farnham You're wrong. Look at what has happened in Rwanda since the genocide there. "Rory @Rory Lee Farnham Botswana's currency is stronger than ours. @hlengani khuvutlu she was head of procurement and some positions at South African Airways Technical. "@hlengani khuvutlu she used to be the head of procurement for the technical division of SAA. So Rory go home boom which position mr mamele was holding "Ag nee 
57:59,59:50, I cant block Rory as he is a returning baddie and I cant see him. block him if he is offensive The problem is that our politicians are not leaders. They are populists and don't do what they know is right because then they'll lose votes. So we are led by the lowest common denominator. We're like a dog chasing its own tail. knock out blow on its way Rory came on after we told Experimental to go home. must be his brother. She denies anything and everything. yup "@Dominic Przybylski Our problem is that we worship wealth rather than integrity. So if our politicians flash their ill-gotten gains @Dominic Przybylski I don't think there are one politician on this earth who is not a populist. They want to win elections. 
59:59,1:02:08, im waiting for the blow "Entitlement is produced through hard Dominic..this is through out the world..politics has turned out to be mafiorism Here it comes......metadata "That's the problem I had with Mmusi Maimane. He is an ambulance chaser instead of being somebody who says ""These are my principles and if you don't vote for them that's your choice Off course its going to be I'm not going to change what I believe in just to try collect your vote. DCJ has to coach her in answering the questions. "Nononono this is what the metadata shows 
1:02:11,1:05:22, JS Bach ​@Dominic Przybylski They want to win elections and they thrive in limelight. "Maimane @Phillip Cwazibe exactly! They want people to like them so that they vote for them. So they will do EVERYTHING to get people to vote for them. PRomise them the moon. @Phillip Cwazibe That's the problem. The only thing we can be sure of is that they will do everything they can to get votes. Too scared to do the right thing. "Rory This lawyer of Memela does not get it into her head that she will be able to re-examine after Kate has finished with her client. @ Dominic it will get worse before it gets better Other problem is that black people were kept poor by apartheid so they think that money will make them happy. The happiest people I know are poor. nt prepared to answer 🙄 
1:05:22,1:06:26, agreed 100% "MEmela lie and deny till you die 😂😂😂 she's in trouble now She is She has just lied under oath @ Dominic Przybylski Difficulty is that most people do not vote for Governance and accountability but popularity. The write thing will be to put all these thieves in prison for at least 25 years shooo 
1:06:33,1:08:05, @DJ DJ what was the direct lie ? I understand @Dominic 100% most African people believe money is happiness...no it's not They can apply for leave to run away. @Phillip Cwazibe The problem with democracy. It makes it almost impossible for a real leader to be in control. "The memory stick issue will sting about the memory stick The Metadata i think the memory stick shows all the current values and she said she did not know "@ Acid Zil ​ while they are in prison 
1:08:09,1:10:36, "@JS Bach. Re the flash stick. The evidence is not that she was the author of the information on the stick @David Tuer Correct. @ Dominic there is no such thing as democracy..nothing.. "Hopefully "Once you hear a witness reading back a page number but takes time to find it Think her whole attitude has changed now. court hook line and bate. "@dada ngova The only thing democracy does is allow for a change of government without civil war A free market is the only real form of democracy. Every time you buy something it is a vote. @Anne M. for sure along with tax evasion etc etc 
1:11:00,1:12:31, @Michael Wild ​ Think her whole attitude has changed now. court hook line and bate. Spoiling her dinner.😂 "@Anne M.​ True if she dint provide Mrs Sambou with flash.y having difficulty to answer.lair If we don't buy the company goes bankrupt. If we do buy they succeed. @DJ DJ to be fair to the liar Ms Memela the Flash stick went thru 6 people before it came back to commission from Soweto back to Midrand and was was not acconted for 3yrs.... Mbanjwa has a point @Dominic we can define democracy on simple terms but in reality you can be deposed as a leader under the auspices of democracy..check Zimbabwe The meta data is reliable "she side eyed her attorney. That is saying 
1:12:38,1:16:09, Sorry this lady is rotten @dada ngova Mugabe was not deposed by votes. He was removed by military and ZANU/PF remained in power. @Phillip Cwazibe I missed that. You are sharp-eyed!! @Mtokozisi Baleni The last person who saved anything on the flash drive was Ms Mamela. The meta data (properties) show that. So this means the majority of the people of Zim did love uncle Rob. no to be corrupt We are all so heavily taxed with load shedding and a failing economy with land grabs and a government that’s trying to legalise land theft were everyone has bought their property Mugabe was literally a murderer and a total racist. He destroyed his country and his people. @Rory he did so under democracy shades 
1:16:09,1:17:59, @Anne I agree but to be fair they hve a right to test the evidence before them. Shes a liar and unworthy Advocate but lets be fair I agree - her technical expert can check be fair to what. Peoples money have been stolen via BEE @dada ngova That's not a democracy in anything but name. Vote counting was fraudulently altered otherwise MDC would have won under Tsvangir. she will pay alot He's going to tell her the same thing (if he's honest) Lies! Lies imagine being represented by ms Memela. @dominic hence I say there is nothing known as democracy.. 
1:18:10,1:20:51, They will need to go through every deal She was involved in. Us poor black people need to cheat to make BEE work @DJ DJ there is nothing wrong with BEE Corrupt people in Responsible positions steal money hiding behind BEE stealing from our people. "How do they employ such incompetent people @dada ngova Unfortunately you are right for most countries except a few like in Switzerland and to a lesser extent in other European countries. Not really @clive oconnell USA is supposed to be a leader in democracy ..look at how African Americans are murdered by law enforcement "@Mtokozisi Baleni BEE in principle is a noble idea but how it is currently practised @dada ngova Police forces the world over are becoming more militarised - including here in SA. 
1:21:04,1:22:26, "@ Acid Zil ​How Yes BEE only empowers a single corrupt indivdual @zuma then I rest my case pleasure your ego @Derek Main Thank you. These Greedy Civil servants with fat salaries also steal from honest BEE companies do you honestly believe a a 100% black owned company would pay its labourers any better @dada ngova USA is not a real democracy. The real power in USA is the big companies. Elections are won by who has the most money. Look how much money Ramphosa had to spend to head ANC. imagine if BEE was not hijacked! @Derek..agreed Were they cousins or just pet names? 
1:22:37,1:23:30, exactly @Anne M. she was the part of SAA CORRUPTION Another snake in the grass here... @Mtokozisi Baleni I agree - there always a corrupter and a corruptee. Our BEE is not working - only a few connected individuals are benefitting. It is not spreading wealth like it was meant to. you never know unless someone talk about. BEE had destroy our believed country...😂😂😂😂 mama can lai @stanely msimango has not had @hlengani khuvutlu Yes @stanely msimango True that - only the criminals are happy with BEE. 
1:23:33,1:24:46, BEE is the only way to empower Blacks but these(MISS MEMELA and company take over they must be stopped and jailed Giving long winded explanations is a means to digress and divert the question asked. hi BEE is a disaster. If we want a successful country we should just let the economy grow without forcing people to be employed by race. If economy grows everybody gets more opportunites. 90 seconds exceeded by 3 minutes lol @dominic I agree..people thought Cyril will work wonders because he is an oligarch...you will learn a lot ...he will let people down sadly Affirmative action is races towards a minority group in South Africa just like what Hitler did with the Jews China is great example what happens if economy is allowed to grow without political control. 
1:25:27,1:27:12, The saddest thing about BEE and AA is that it makes every succesful black person suspect. well said @Acid Zil @Dominic Przybylski I disagree - there is a lot of political involvement in the Chinese economy. "Had definition Yes Judge Zondo!! THis is an important question! What is she Saying @Derek Main I'm comparing China now with 60% of economy now in private sector compared to the time when it didn't allow private sector at all. "YEs @Jacob Zuma please re think your 15% 
1:27:41,1:28:35, @Dominic Przybylski OK - maybe less political involvement but definitely still there. 15% of black individuals only prosper from BEE zondos problem is that he doesn't understand some of these operations OK 😂 hmmmm boom all SOEs are destroyed by Corrupt leaders hiding under BEE just arrest these criminals "@Derek Main China allows people to be hired and fired at any time @dada ngova I think he understands perfectly. 
1:28:43,1:29:21, KA BOOM @DJ DJ I doubt whether it's as high as 15%. Yup She must accept it was improper. she have to answer question. Ask her Mr Zondo @Ishaad Mohammed Yes!!! KA BOOM indeed. Zondo is very clever @JS disagreed 
1:29:23,1:30:07, "Adv Memela has explained @Dominic Przybylski Yes - China is certainly not a paragin of worker's rights. this witness beats around the bush and she is slowly burying herself "Bollocks mr Z nail her please let ms hofmeyer take her down chair must listen and follow.... from sard Dada he is a lawyer and it is part of the training. they have to know how companies purchase and manage items. every big company has a lawyer or lawyer company. and it's not that complicated. private smses 
1:30:16,1:31:24, yoooooh They were sent to my private address......mmmmm....now why would you do that? She's burned. Why she using private emails sms for work related issues @Gerda 7 U nailed it. I also believe Jugde Zondo is very intelligent No wonder hes DCJ hai shes beating around the bush true @JZ she just admitted in her own words she was guiding them @Anne M. thants 
1:31:26,1:32:34, It’s like having a fruit tree and eating all the fruit and then using the tree as fire would instead of nourishing the tree and letting it feed you for years to come She is too clever for herself. "Just because others contacted you on your private e-mail and personal phone go go gone This is when we need JUDGE JUDY desperately. Hillary Clinton not Killerey ooohhhh ya and why did you use private email. @Michael...being a layer does not mean you know everything...he hasn't got business know how

1:34:45,1:36:25, @Dada Judge Zondo can see a liar from a mile...... He has wisdom. That can't be learnt in a course. That is why he is DCJ. jz is blocked I wish we had Pinocchios in real life. Honestly her nose would be out the door by now. Wow @ Michael not so sure about how authentic that is @Pheladi Lamola 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤣🤣🤣 Adv Memela should keep answers crisp......... I would be frustrated if I was her counsel. Dada we could ask others to confirm that when studying Law they go through the process of Business management. this witness is prolonging in order to evade the truth 
1:36:40,1:38:10, am not aware of crisp answers...is this English Y cant this lady just respond to questions 🎯🎯 hahaha there you go......😂😂😂😂 No communication.... coz she dont no her job "i believe this inquiry is just a wast of time and resources jacob leave the lady.s weight alone "Bull's eye "😂😃😃😃 @Winston Paul its all the money shes carrying

I sense a bit of prejudice. She doesn't seem to understand that she has been in contravention of just about every rule controlling communication with bidders. she can continue to study in Jail. 
1:44:50,1:46:25, @felix muyoba she should be demoted and go straight to jail not class @thulani fadashe from who? Confounds me how she became an advocate. The document doesn't talk to queries relating to Supplier Development Programme...........

Thats is how I found out@Anne M. Jacob Zuma​ NEVER😂😂😂 Some of the answers of Adv Memela have been poor but need a skilled re-examination to iron out the poor answers....... I think she has been consistent in her evidence @Michael Wild I'll be surprised if her lawyer does much in the way of re-examination. That would only make it worse for Memela. And I think you fell asleep Mandisi The reason she shouldn't have communicated with a bidder is because that would give the bidder an unfair advandtage. liar 
2:07:24,2:09:22, I agree David. "@Derek Main nothing is stopping her from talking to the bidder i cant stop laughing at this lady Jacob Zuma days are numbered as the rest of the world is watching and planning to give sanctions on South Africa if law is ignored constantly in South Africa "@Dereck Main @ mandisi ntauzana exactly. Some of us are already putting a guilty verdict forward because of this challenge she has. Loose tongues sink ships. @mandisi ntauzana The clause was put there to prevent any unfair advantage to any bidder. It's obvious. @Derek Main do you think a cleaner in SAA shouldnt talk to a bidder even though the cleaner does not sit in the Bid Adjudication 
2:09:43,2:12:06, DCJ is getting irritated with her I responded to many invitations to tender and there's no excuse to ignore any condition of tender unless the buyer explicitly agrees to change the conditions in writing. Chair is reading the clause too wide since the clause is talking about PM who a supplier must talk with if someone can.handover to. D @mandisi ntauzana She assisted the bidder and they paid for her house. Simple. amen No the house was explained @Derek Main "Mandisi Mandisi another way to look at this. is who give your mother 2.5 million rand when they dont know them. 
2:12:33,2:14:34, @mandisi ntauzana You must be ANC because you take us all for fools. @Michael Michael Basic money laundering. Exactly Derek LOL hahahahaha @Derek Main once a person raises something different they are bracketed into a political party (ANC in this case) @mandisi ntauzana Your reasoning gives you away. let's leave parties out. let's focus on this lady and corrupt that she was accused of.
