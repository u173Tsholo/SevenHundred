1:37:15,1:53:35, its easy to understand Mr. Zondo. The frequent adjournment and delays in the state capture commission is fruitless and wasteful expenditure hi We dont need the fwd klerk "ta Norma po wremeni @Luvuyo Zantsi I totally agree with you. Kungani sachitha isikhathi nemali kule @Vadim Schubernel weapons? why??😓 Nobody today can tell me why If Africa is for Africans why the Koi San and Bushman not recognised as a group of their own in this beloved country? waste of money this commission 
1:54:47,2:06:16, @Derrick Paul if Africa is for Africans why are they streaming into Europe then? Yes you have all of that but you didn’t do what you were supposed to do Because many of those foreign firms aided the state to be looted. "...Africa is a continent Mona Aspirin ohne Complex 😉👍 Another thing Derek. Africa has EVERYTHING Europe wants. Without Africa there would be no Europe. "...""If""Africa converted to the USD @Lee Hendrix how??? petrodollar is dominant and belongs to US

How long is it going to take to explain what an audit is? @Mr Zantsi common sense vs Economic logic.... Ask those from Zimbabwe what that means. Dont force others into poverty when your perseption is based on perception and political senssolisation. the monetary system needs to be revised...why is money created as debt?. ...Division is the purpose of imperialist...wealthy imperialist. Religion is a psychological condition accepted by those who do not or cannot reason for themselves...is the cause of poverty worldwide. Population of revenue is the total revenue=sales

What nonsense are you talking? The history of this beautiful country started long before the white colonialists arrived we have to change the government please I missed a couple of hours of his testimony because of load shedding. Has Mr Sokombela explained why no further action was taken after so many qualified audits were issued? 
2:45:44,2:48:51, @Anne M. He has been educating on the role of the AG so far. He still has to deal with SAA specifics. Thanks @Mzalwane Mzala you were born in Cape but where did you parents come from and their parents ? ...SCOPA has the facts and seems aggressive for compliance. @anya van loggerenberg I really have no time to deal with ignorance as the 'homelands' were set up by an apartheid law not very long ago.
