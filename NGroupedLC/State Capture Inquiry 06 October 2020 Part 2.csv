You know what to do 🤣 @Mtokozisi Baleni Very fair comment. @ Danie Nilsen you do got an appeal of a model. @wim louw You was busy with that handsome boy and I did not want to distract you from that that is as far as shal go appeal nothing more @ Yolo Moore is too excited to be here... @Jongi Cayalli And where are you (geographically-speaking)? @Handsome Boy to be where @ Danie Nilsen haven't you won Mr South Africa or something? 
1:45:41,1:46:56, "@Pastor J.J 🙏🙏🙏 I feel we are cuckoos Mr Ramaphosa was there for 4 of the 9 years. @Zakhele Gumede Fair enough @ Yolo More you seem happy to be texting on this stream. Like you would probably record this day in your diary. afternoon guys who is this So what is this all about? @wim louw I have been on this and the enca chat for every single hearing so Jongi is more of a refugee that I am hahahahahahaha @Zakhele Gumede Why did Maraphosa Did not say anything? I think this entire state capture commission is an distraction 
1:47:03,1:47:55, Naledi I'm a South African from Cape Town But he needs to account to some extent. "DCJ Zondo @Zakhele Gumede And he saw nothing in those 4 years. Watch this space he told us recently. I am watching and nothing is happening. "...So @Pastor J.J i will conclude with this comment that the current ANC are toxic sick with coruption and it is termenal @Yolo More At the Omotoso bail hearing? I already ruled on the comment allegedly made by @Handsome Boy 🤣 Please withdraw 'Awkhoright' it's un-communitical 🤣😂 What are these hearings going to reveal? Does anyone know how much a Covid Test in SA costs? 
1:48:04,1:48:53, @Danie Nilsen You always say it the best Bro. Wisdom 100% @Handsome Boy I am always happy my chomma. Everyday and everywhere. 1500 Rands @Zakhele Gumede Ramaphosa ihas always been part of ANC goverment Not saying he saw nothing. He actually was appointed when things were happening at both Eskom an SAA. And then he was sidelined. Is Rmaphosa really innocent or the country is just protecting its president reputation? @R.m. B. i paid R1800 at Lancet Laboratories @ Thobani Mkananda maybe they should have appointed a white prosecutor on Tim Omotoso's trial😬 @Doctrine Doomsday : Thanks bud. 
1:48:55,1:49:40, @R.m. B. why are you asking about the costs of a covid test? is covid still around LOL @Handsome Boy i wish there are vacancies for 66 year overwieght males "i personally feel he musat be guilty "Remember  "Did the well-being of these honest I remember JZ going to Medupi where he promised that LoadShedding was a thing of the past. He also went to SAA to a heroes welcome and promised that SAA was there to stay. @Thobani Mkananda I withdraw my skat🤗 
1:49:41,1:51:12, @Buyani Mhlongo No Politian is innocent. @Doctrine Doomsday : I am a Saffa living in Europe and I want to come home.... "those champions care about one thing @Handsome Boy 😂🤣 I hereby reprimand you Cc @Yolo More 🤣😂 Ramaphosa should have his day at the Zondo Commission How did Ramaphosa make so much money???.. "@R.m. B. I'm also abroad @ Danie Nilsen if you haven't won Mr South Africa title then South Africa is just simply jealous of you. Oops! homesick 
1:51:18,1:52:12, @Handsome Boy 😂🤣they tried before but they never succeeded. It can't true that Ramaphosa did not have any dealings with the state? Last i heard Ramaphosa is a billionaire @Phillip Van Rensburg . It is sickening because they claim to care about the proverbial ' Where are you @Naledi Barron ? Euro 70 here.... i hope the masses vote these thieves out so that we may move our country forward @ Thobani Mkananda I need to leave. The world awaits my sexiness. Claim to care about the proverbial 'Black child' 
1:52:14,1:53:26, @Mtokozisi Baleni This people are really frustrating the ordinary people like us.This includes justice system. @Mtokozisi Baleni Now if Mr Ramaphosa is implicated will they ask him to resign? "@Lindani Moyo At the moment "I want to see my mother who has advance Dementia "@Naledi Barron Eish @ Yolo More take care of @ Danie Nilsen while I am away. @Mtokozisi Baleni Are we really free? Shouldn't we lower TAX? @R.m. B. Do what your gut tells you to do! "@Naledi Barron please trade places with me 
1:53:34,1:54:46, RMB come see your mom mate there is a makulu vacume for any party or president in this country Your gut is wrong @Buyani Mhlongo The media will defend him. Nothing will be written about him. @Handsome Boy you to keep well "@Lindani Moyo The deal is simple. Do what you've got to do i wonder when are they going to resume this commission?? @Handsome Boy where to? Stay man. Your sexiness is much appreciated here 16:20 i think? 
1:54:48,1:56:31, "@Naledi Barron: my gut says stay put Lel so turue "@Mtokozisi Baleni​ True true State Capture has targeted People unfortunetly it has cost us a Billon to bring them to court ok cool its back on hey guys is it not yet clear that the state of capture had gone very deep. anyone still arguing that Zuma was not complicit if not the architect of the capture? Hahaha! this witness are very much in love with curry and bunny chows no man i want some to 
1:56:47,1:59:40, "@R.m. B. It is so sad to say what was this lady.s role is she related to brian molefe? @Roza essack CFO "...Being Educated @Cerebis I tend to agree with you on that Carmen thanks who's is this witness? Pleasure @Roza essack . My heart bleeds for these executives.... 
2:00:11,2:00:53, "mine too @ Yolo More the problem is SanFran Anorld is jealous of how sexy I am.. @Cerebis : Maybe in future we get a reliable Police Force; a corruption-proof NPA and Justice system. Zondo must get the best security in the country She was the CFO at Eskom I believe. BUT SA will be in so much debt to whoever is silly enough to lend SA money and will be even worse off than now. @Phillip Van Rensburg . So sad. looks like they got rid of all the those that knew the job They have already started killing witnesses 
2:01:03,2:02:41, @Russia Mrs Molefe @Carmen James ur heart must not bleed these executives. They received 6 million each. @ Danie Nilsen do you eat any curry? "@Doctrine Doomsday Wherever you go Yeah DCJ needs 24 hour security @Angelo Doubel . That may be the case but they were targeted because they stood in the way of rampant looting. @Handsome Boy how did you come to a conclusion that @SanFran Arnold is jealous of your sexiness? only that my wife makes State capture did not only damaged our SOE's it also destroyed a lot of careers. 
2:02:43,2:04:22, "@R.m. B. Most of South Africa hoped and prayed for that after 1994. We wanted to believe in the ""Rainbow Nation"" of Archbishop Tutu. Even he is now praying for the fall of the ANC. Sad hey?" "From what I know though who is ms molefe? former CFO at Eskom @Phillip Van Rensburg i think Zondo is safe. The real danger is these witnesses we see everyday here whos protecting them? You are right @Gift Mazibuko . A new book called the Whistleblowers has come out. Very sad. People lost a lot. rolls eyes... Can't wait for Zuma to appear here @ Yolo More because last time I spoke to @ SanFran Anorld she wanted me to leave the room because my sexiness was distracting the stream. 
2:04:22,2:05:26, @Carmen James This new book - available via Amazon/online? Witnesses who are implicated in the looting don't require protection. lolll Not sure @Naledi Barron . Mandy Wiener is the author. @ Carmen James- True dat.. @ Danie Nilsen you got an Indian wife? @Pheladi Lamola exactly Naledi u so fortunate to be able to read books i used to alot at 1 tym That will be a pity Buyani 
2:05:33,2:06:23, @Carmen James I remember Mandy Wiener (Radio 702) I'll look out for it. Thank you! Wow UK education. . "@Kopz Koape Nope "@Pheladi Lamola Anoj I wish my hair was that straight 😁 Black excellence :goodvibes: "Yes It was on 702 Clement Manyathela show.. "@Samuel Skosana​ He is closed within a cirle of implecations  
2:06:33,2:07:31, @Cerebis.. Evidence against who malema or floyd shavambu??? @ Danie Nilsen so you are a playa like Jacob Zuma? "Ramaphosa knew that if he wanted to fight this corruption he must win "@Roza essack Are you compromised health-wise from reading books? If so well educated👏👏👏 @Kopz Koape Follow the money. naledi yes London.... @Cerebis..I thought so 
2:07:32,2:09:20, The day African politician will telling the truth that is the day we can rise @Handsome Boy yes but i protect my victems "@Roza essack Ok All that education challenged by ninkampoops @Naledi Barron email it to me and I can forward to @Roza essack This lady cannot be corrupted. She does not need Escom to realise her ambition @Cerebis..Im not a Malema fan by the way..But im just being objective here..If there is really evidence that he is guilty i would like to see it..Till then he is innocent! @ Danie Nilsen I think all these ladies are attracted to your model appeal. "The problem with this 
2:09:26,2:10:27, "Some bring me up to speed @Handsome Boy apreciated lol Yes Mnguni "@Pastor J.J Ok There you go.......She was exposing the New Age contract!!!!! It is heart breaking that the very same looters of Eskom now want to dictate to Judge Zondo to recuse himself... "@R.m. B. thats fine because by the time they do that Thanks @More That is why she was targeted.....Bloody crooks!!!!! 
2:10:45,2:12:07, @ Danie Nilsen getting ladies at 61 is so gangster. naledi plz foward to pastor nd u can also ask him for my email ad @SanFran Arnold - too true! the corupters of the country is like canibals eating the little the poor have This is why Anoj had to come to Eskom. He too laid a trail of destruction in SOE's @Handsome Boy 66 more difficult @Kopz Koape They have failed to provide evidence in Malemas cases including his companies of his brothers Vultures its unbelievable what a mess these SOEs the politics of looters 
2:12:20,2:14:43, Is That Treseme Hair? This people must be arrested finish and klaar "May be a bit early @R.m. B. She is definitely credible fixinging the problem is to help the goverment get usedt to a lot of money realy it is like luckey packets to them Just because she isn't stuttering doesn't mean she is credible.. "@Kopz Koape Agree on the issue with malema @Handsome Boy . She is credible. @R.m. B. She is extremely honest. I have known her for the last 20years. An amazing young woman 
2:14:55,2:16:48, All this are going Arrested @Handsome Boy 🤫 shush! Credibility of a witness is determined by her or his performance under cross examination. "As I said How do you know her @Pastor J.J You guys are just biased. . Handsome Boy! Stuttering isn't a qualifier!:elbowcough: @Sfiso Mnguni I have known her on many levels both in the Corporate world and at a personal level You don't even wait for her to be cross examined but she is already credible to you 😯 
2:17:06,2:18:29, So are you not so Handsome Boy!! is the witness suspended with pay???? "As much she is not stuttering "justice Zondo I salute you @Cerebis..Malema is more confused than anything..I have never seen a politician who flip flops like him.. Remember his position on the public protector and how he changed his mind @ Pastor J. J is asking for an autograph. . She is not an accused person @Handsome Boy So this Tsotsi is a real tsotsi that treseme wig is about to fall off eish wena ntombi 
2:18:54,2:20:07, It appears so @Mgculisi Qwabe @ Tshika Tshabeng there is lot of evidence that I am sexy. And the most compelling one is my face. Who hires someone called Tsotsi to be responsible for money? @Pastor J.J so you never worked for eskom? Tsotsi was under pressure from the Guptas dnt ever hire a person with a surname of tsotsi. Hawa and the Guptas are now entering the fray. @ Carmen James she is a witness? "@Brian Hayes 
2:20:09,2:21:10, Yup @Handsome Boy See no grapevine please dont disappoint. lets see this... what does tsotsi mean in your language? 🤔🤔🤔 @Banele Masuku Hehe....but let's hear the evidence first? She might surprise us by being innocent of all charges? "Y'all are out of order gun gum "Banele @Thobela..Tsotsi means thug.. @ Carmen James do you think she got hidden agenda? 
2:21:14,2:22:43, Crook? @Thobela Wem Tsotsi in Venda means someone who steals @Sthakathi Khumalo 😂 This lady cannot be corrupted! @Banele Masuku they were looking for a tsotsi to work with and loot "No gigabyte Why does the DCJ put his mask on for some witnesses? Or does he have some flu himself? Does he smell something bad? Yolo More Now I cant date a Zuma surnamed girl because I would be considered corrupt. Naaah we cant have that 
2:23:10,2:24:15, @ Carmen James let me trust your judgment . "so if tsotsi means the samething across all languages "she sounds honest "#Thola tsotsi in my language is a ""Skelm""" "powerful lady @Cerebis - what is she “charged” with? "Carmen @ Yolo More can we agree that this lady is distracted by how sexy I look? Please trust me @Handsome Boy. This one is a winner! 
2:24:53,2:25:46, Well she really transformed @Handsome Boy agreed friend "Simmy @handsome .. you sexy????yoh @ Carmen James I will definitely sue you for misleading me if I find out that you were lying ! skeberege this tsotsi all of them we go to jail crs "@R.m.

Hehehe!!!!! was married to skelm Molefe. you now see the reason she kicked Brian The same Salim Essa who got that other one who was curious to the hotel. Salim likes honies🤔 I will revert back to you Simmy @Cerebis - aha. Wait for the bombshells! i really do not think she is corrupt... what do you think... 
2:26:29,2:27:31, I'm not convinced as yet what kind of encounter? "@handsome..nah you not handsome This is Brian Molefe's wife? "The last time I checked Romeo Khumalo was a radio metro DJ Clearly this lady is NOT corrupt Hehehe!!!!! Chief of Staff and Salim Essa at the Engen Garage!:dothefive: Why did she remain with the Molefe surname if they divorced I wonder? "Russia 
2:27:32,2:28:48, Eddy she was never Brains wife Tobela she was never corrupt "Gift Mazibuko 😂😂😂 So the financial director of Eskom is meeting dodgy people in dodgy areas hi @Essdie yeah i can see @Refiloe Nkabinde . she is definitely not Brian's wife. @ Simmy Ndlovu have you ever seen someone as sexy as I am? I mean not even your weave gets you closer to look half as sexy as I am. Where did you meet him?? 
2:28:50,2:30:09, This is a no nonsense woman!!!! "Ohh also met Issa I believe she is telling the truth and has a lot to lose by not telling the truth i.e. her Chartered Accountants license. "@handsome JZ's regime was akin to a gangster regime She doesn't like Tsotsi @ Simmy Ndlovu because I am not wearing a weave like you? Meetings at garages sounds like a lot of squeeky wheels that need to be oiled Refile.. I read about her

Isn't it amazing how this witness can recount all of these events ? This deserves an Award! @ Simmy Ndlovu girls who wear weaves avoid getting into a fight because they know they will have it pulled out and get their balding head exposed. hahaha tshika tshabeng she is an accountant after all they are highly trained in documenting and memory replenishment 
2:33:29,2:34:51, @Simmy Ndlovu I agree with you. He is unnecessarily hassling you. He must desist now. "Very confident "Simmy why put the mask on now? "handsome She is going to expose all the skelms Who is this? "Yolo "the way she relays it

I remember I was once impressed by Agrizzi's testimony "handsome mr chair u are toooo gud 🤣😂😅 Derek Govender Salim Essa was there to intervene with financial plans 😅 @Yolo More:🤣🤣🤣🤣handsome and Simmy. vey funny handsome you trying to attract who here? 
2:37:33,2:38:41, Too 2222 @ Simmy Ndlovu okay but the point is you aren't confident enough to show your real hair. "mduduzi I never trusted Agrizzi. He came to the Commission as a known crook. He has a deal with the Commission I think.? "hair @mduduzi mavimbela 🤣😂😂🤣 yhuuuu! @Simmy and its bordering along dangerous territories @ Yolo More do you trust this lady giving evidence? Her story sounds rehearsed. . The Zuma clique are going to run out of hit-men at this rate 🤫 
2:39:27,2:40:49, "mduduzi @ Simmy Ndlovu hmm chances are you are one those females with hair on their chest. "Banele handsome..yes definitely imagine if Zondo is on Zumas payroll..I would not be surprised @Handsome Boy . Nothing rehearsed her. She wanted to follow due processes Eskom''s illegal suspension of these executives is very similar to the that of the SABC 8. Proof that state capture was a well planned systematic madness. @Gift Mazibuko thats true. @ Carmen James who is going to cross examine her? 
2:41:10,2:42:01, @Handsome Boy stop annoying Simmy and us here and Simmy dont entertain him "Yes @Gift agree .same with the covid19 funds sadly It is no wonder why Zuma is up to his old tricks trying to evade the commission. The insults aren't really necessary adults! @Simmy..Wig or weave..You mean weave???? Ehhhe chair as CFO what were the issues in drafting the finance plan... what were her difficulties "agree "LM 
2:42:03,2:43:19, @Russia Magezi True. He told the truth alright but he was a crook. My point is she might be telling the truth but we don't know the whole story yet @Handsome Boy . I have no further words for you. "Kopz @ Simmy Ndlovu I know underneath that weave is Zondo's bald head. I like Ntate Zondo line of questioning you can just hear hes a legal mind legend👌 "I agree with you Banele Eric Wood arrest them all we are tire about corruption off them "handsome

Very impressive witness in all respects! Very courageous. Regiments - Trillion - McKinsey known as the unholy trinity 
2:47:21,2:48:52, @ Yolo More yeah and @ Simmy Ndlovu is intimidated by my sexy looks. She definitely has a sour relationship with mirrors because she isn't impressed by what they reflect when she looks into them. your mother @handsome son of a b Could be Venda. . "@SanFran Arnold Y'know HOW ARE IS YOU "@Handsome @Simmy i got tired of that weirdo talking about himself and behaving like he is Trump so i blocked him..Take my advice block that weirdo @Naledi Barron . All 3 are pure poison. Kopz he is a dog 
2:48:53,2:50:00, Ehhe Chair - she was unable to draft a financial plan.. Sounds like Me. Tsotsi was living up to his name at Eskom. "@Handsome Boy thats enough now @ Simmy Ndlovu what does my mother have to do with you wearing hair that doesn't naturally belong to you? Retracted! @Carmen i have my doubts.I know how these people operate.You would have seen it here in this comm how they protect each other agree "@Eddie Reddy - why does everything have to be allegedly racist. If she was European @Simmy Ndlovu You are giving airtime to an oxygen thief. Ignore him my Sister 
2:50:17,2:50:57, @Handsome Boy when you highlight one's name dont leave space between @ and the name. WHATS HAPPENING JUST TUNE IN ":Tsotsi "" is a township lingo for a thug "There we have it @ SanFran Anorld I guess my sexy self should leave??.. not "@Naledi indeed @Derek Govender . I don't agree. This is precisely why she was suspended. She refused to co-operate with Eric Wood et al @Handsome Boy that would be appreciated 
2:51:21,2:52:57, @Yolo More thanks son. @Handsome Boy You are getting abusive Honey. You need to stop now or I will report you for abusive action. You are plain stupid it would seem to me. it seems the only country in the SADC region which is not corrupt is Botswana..The government has been considered squeaky clean @Pastor J. J always poking his unwanted nose where it doesn't belong. "@Thendo Luruli My heart weeps. There were so many of us who didn't care about colour/religion/tribe/anything. I had to solutions When something is wrong it smells @Carmen listening to her last few words you could very well be right @Carmen James you re correct brave woman I like her 
2:53:09,2:54:42, "I love how she stood her own Yes @Eddie Reddy Carry on listening @Derek Govender . She is going to join the dots for us!!!!! it seems Mr Tsotsi compromised himself to be used as corruption doormat at Eskom She is now CEO of Transnet @Cerebis I think I was fair when speaking ill against those who wear weaves but @Simmy Ndlovu started involving my mother and grandmother and none of you biased scumbags are saying anything about that @Eddie Reddy no shes not She is Telkom's CFO "No 
2:54:44,2:56:26, @Kopz Koape Agree with you. Namibia is also not corrupt. "@Eddie "@Thendo Luruli The ultimate honour I was given was being called a ""Cadbury Top Deck"".

Biased much? @Carmen isn't Brian s ex @Cerebis it seems both Botswana and Namibia are stable countries unlike SA "She is not Brian's ex wife 
2:56:37,2:57:46, "actually these women and Brian are great administrators "@Handsome Boy I am not biased @Cerebis also.. Botswana has a low crime rate..Its so relaxed there Thanks Carmen This show why we have so much social ills on the ground level. These people are thieves mara.

2:57:55,2:59:39, I mean my mother and grandmother who mind you is no longer alive was dragged into this and insulted despite the fact that they both got nothing to do with this but the weave lady gets support 😑 "@Carmen James @Bonang Sithole Political Pressure??? He IS CORRUPT I like that she stood her ground despite the pressure from Matjila et al. @Handsome Boy g sit somewhere in a corner and play with yourself She is strong @Pheladi Lamola . She resisted Matjila and Tsotsi! I blocked the Boy and his fake Pastor. Peaceful on my chat site. Slightly off topic: Is it true that the commission can't prosecute or convict anyone? @SanFran Anorld you are biased because you didn't tell that weave wearing lady to stop with the personal attacks dammit. Who was more personal between her and I?i never said anything about her mom. 
2:59:40,3:01:33, yeah its true "@Banele Masuku thats true toothless dogs of the law "Sheezuz!! McKinsey (""Management Consultants"") were nothing more than blatant thieves!!!" @Cerebis..I heard its difficult to get a citizenship in Botswana..Im thinking of relocating there @Kopz Koape I know people who started doing business in Botswana. The Government does a lot to assist new business ventures. My understanding is that NPA can prosecute based on evidence presented at this Commission @Phillip Van Rensburg "There is a coalition between the two @Banele Masuku but the president gave the NPA the authority to use what comes out of the commission to prosecute. 
3:01:41,3:03:37, "@Banele Masuku - as far as I understand "Yah @SanFran Arnold So we're basically watching a gossip show @Andre Gerber oh you also wear a weave .. "@James as per the presidential directives Thanks @Cerebis.. Are you aware that there is a rivarly between SA and Botswana??.It might be difficult for a South African to settle there @Banele Masuku we are watching the evidence in order to make sure that the NPA prosecute "@Banele Masuku No 
3:03:38,3:05:02, just blocked the idiot Handsome the commission is putting pressure to the NPA... @Handsome Boy I saw the comments you made towards a woman and I did not like it. It ended there for me. Dan Marokane’s testimony makes me angry at the way professionals were hounded our just to ease looting This lady will be Witness for the State when the corrupt are in court to face the music. @Kopz Koape There is no problem to get Permanent residence in Botswana. The problem it would appear to be between a certain ANC minister's wife and elements in Botswana. @SanFran Anorld and you liked the comments she made about my mother and grandma huh? Plus Nick Linnell Thanks for the info fellas 
3:05:07,3:06:34, "Please remind me "Oops! @Andre Gerber Meant ""nuke""" "@Andre the english ducth law is realy failing us. @Cerebis ok im going there..Thanks for the info!
