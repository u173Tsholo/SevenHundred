15:44,27:03, The guy is talking as if his running for something Fearfontein is making this guy fearful @Desmond Masilela perhaps the guy was warned that since you are leaving eskom and you know what is happening here if you ever expose us we will come for you where ever you are.. @Felix Muyoba. 😂😂😂😂😂 @Yin Yang i now agree with you on that where is the sound? sound is on the left ear peace something wrong I can only hear one side. @Yin Yang as soon as he discovered some anomalies at eskom he left..he is an honest citizen.. "Rama was the chairman of MTN when Iran charged the company with corruption.....FNB 
28:10,34:26, The sound is better now from my side The guy dont even know what to say sound in left speaker only my right ear is getting jealous with no sound ha ha yes "I think some people here need to reboot their PC's SABC tech will say he must speak over the mic and not from one side only. :) IEC to investigate anc for bosasa election funding @Myka'Al Daud Don't hold your breath - IEC is compromised @Myka'Al Daud do you think investigation can yield anything? 
34:35,40:39, we are waiting for Zuma's time "prisoner of hope Truth shall set us free ANC have breached about 5 critical laws which should have them removed from taking part in voting for 8 years. until they clean up there act. and ask Venezuela to keep the MECs visiting them. @Myka'Al Daud if the rural people were eating and drinking at an anc rally with that money from bosasa..do you think they understand that it was illegal? they dont.. PG refuses to be cross examined by Moyane Is he hiding something or just enjoying his rights? Do we want to believe that the entire ANC esp the NEC didn't know that the dealing with bossasa was illegal? "Why waist state funds on this  
41:21,43:11, I think those young educated man and woman took advantage of the fact that.the former head of state cant clearly read and understand the writings.even if down on the line we need pardon him. @Nelson Musoliwa they knew..just ignorance..typical of african ruling parties attitude.. Let bygone be bygone and start again with EFF .Please freedom fighter beware afrikaaners. ... Yin disagree Guys....No Pardon for criminals whatsoever....... Michael there is no excuse if you pardon one you must pardon all. He was clever enough to defraud the state so he is eligible to stand trial and go to jail. "@MIKE LOCK I agree - if we want to stop the rot Did we pardon apartheid agents ? 
43:21,45:41, @Musa Bakiti ...reckon u been nbrainwashed Bra I agree to in jail with the keys thrown away. @Derek Main ....spot on Daud should have locked up Verwoerd but a white guy shot him before that could happen. No mercy for any of them......SA needs this going forwards "SA is a forgiving nation which Mboweni again?? we must forgive him What I would like to know is if we taxpayers are going to be funding the legal defense for any of these criminals. I don't think we should. 
45:51,49:03, "@Myka'Al Daud  We must start exporting our criminals to overseas like China export its criminals to Africa. Musa they put a hole in a corrupt persons head in China "We forgiven sellouts who wrote letters to SB @Yin it is however difficult to believe that people who fought gallantly against oppression can do such a thing. all those who are implicated they must face full might of the law especial high profile leaders from ANC 70% of them are involved we also want forfeit unit "All this corrupt ppl of Eskom @Nelson Musoliwa ........brainwashed by the Commies Bra is't the same Tito? 
49:28,53:33, @Desmond Masilela ...spot on Pastor Mboro told us on Sunday service that Eugene Terrebranch is missing in heaven. "We gave apartheid killers 2nd chance forgave @MIKE LOCK. They are all corrupt to the core. @Myka'Al Daud ..absolute not true "@Yin Yang what homelands @Desmond Masilela ...too true...they all knew what was going on "Why divide the country 
53:45,57:10, Is this Yin oryt?? @MIKE LOCK. Now we keep on wasting time and money for this commission. Why cant they go straight to court and be prosecuted and send them to jail. This is just a wast. @Michael Michael imagine! Yang They were suffocated from the start not to develop to certain level by the regime as they were just spoon fed economically. "I knew what was going on but 34% unemployment  Julle kan lekker K@K praat hier ne. @Myka'Al Daud Let them come and confess their sins first and then we'll decide if they have revealed all and been truthful hau wena kobus!!!

Australia does have some high power prices though but if you go with the right energy provider for your area you will save money Vote ✊🏿economic freedom fighters come May 19 so no monopoly. you have more than one energy supplier isn't it may 8th ? Free electricity in my lifetime come May 19 he is EFF knows nothing @Johnny Cash... you will be cashless shortly afterwards Bra Soweto residents owe Eskom R20 billion @Johnny Cash EFF power do not worry about wild michael he won't bite you. 
1:55:27,1:58:22, They are part of the problem ANC promised a great future that they could not give. and now the EFF I'd feeding off the same people that are now suffering even more caused by ANC. its time to look at reality and build from that. Soweto residents must pay @Magda Seguin .....the culture of entitlement is at play... I heard a Soweto women say that free electricity is in the ANC Freedom Charter everyone that use should pay that is only fair. every body must pay the services Soweto residents also refused prepaid metres When we expropriate the land and the banks and even the roads and all monopoly business come May 19 money will be plenty ✊🏿eff 
1:58:26,2:02:41, only people with special cases should be granted power until they can correct that. "How can one pay with no job  @Johnny Cash ...Gees..Bra...you really have been brainwashed "Don't know about you all 8 May 2019 my CIC will be the new president in my lifetime ✊🏿 Me Hofmeyer acts as if she is in court Unless something else is happening on the 19th Eish guys I have out of office for while Zuma’s reply on intelligence reports recommendation he is implicated I wonder why intelligence didn’t investigate anything during his tenure 😳😳😳 @Sinx 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 
2:05:19,2:10:03, Jail can assist him to recall everything he forgotten. @Johnny Cash How old are you? -50? "Zizojika izinto Ramaphosa uzophatha ungakhali mntwana nam it is his time to clean up and make Anc and the country dignity has mandated to perform that "The SSA even spied on NGOs "@magda Seguin I agreed with you Pastor Mboro pray for MR Bester Guys can we expect another witness tomorrow? Ijst feel sory for president Ramaphosa because he must do the damage control nw "Ramaphosa didn't clean MTN 
2:10:06,2:14:05, President Ramaphosa leads the renewal of both the ANC and the state. "Zuma ruled SA as his own fiefdom Ramaphosa was deputy president while all this was happening - he's implicated He is capitalist in sabbathical leave Lead us Ramaphosa Ramaphosa and the entire ANC are on trial here Zuma and the SSA even tried to stop Ramaphosa's bid for ANC president.The report is in the public domain...everyone can access it. At Songezo nqonji it is a painful one because Zuma as the president hide only Ramaphosa and Piyega who was criticized even blamed but president Zuma escaped from criticism I disagree at Derek as u said he was deputy so he was restricted u can not fight ur boss 
2:14:21,2:17:50, While he sat as board member FNBSA charged blacks more interests for loans Zuma must come clean on the murders of refugees in camps in exile...he was the head of intelligence. Ramathlodi gave a very intensive testimony here at the Commission about it. @Songezo Nqonji Why? Are you saying the deputy president has no power? As part of the cabinet and the NEC he made the decision to protect Zuma "While he sat in board of directors at Lonmin blacks stayed in shacks with no services We must all rally behind Ramaphosa @Songezo Nqonji Don't try to reason with other people as they are not prepared to consider sense because they have a clear agenda. This Bester is liar "Zuma ruled one faction of the ANC @makhosi nobhatyi They see Ramaphosa as a threat to their political fortunes and thus they target him. 
2:18:36,2:24:55, Anybody from the ANC is a threat to Sa's fortunes - they have proven that and now it is all coming out "He is defending the country from thieves those benefiting from this class apartheid will support Rama @ Mzalwane Mzala i heard u Yep - those waiting for their turn at the trough They protect their comfort zone ANC is corrupt to the core You're just scared Ramaphosa is fixing SARS 
2:25:35,2:28:25, Where was he 9 years ago? EFF must come and clean up all old face in government He was in business nine years ago. At least read if you are to be an effective propagandist. I don't I block those who insult me...not worth the effort to address them V/P vs President He was also deputy president of the ANC 9 years ago - surely he had some influence. Why didn't he use it? Influence hahaha 
2:28:44,2:30:28, That's rich - you calling me a propagandist? Who am I a propagandist for? @Derek Main I like the way u ask your questions The ANC destroyed the country and must fall.Here some people think I am a propagandist...lol "Reading bias information is useless @Derek Main Stop lying. Kgalema Motlanthe was the deputy president of both the country and the ANC then. OK - forgive me 7 years ago @Derek Main dont entertain populists Should have been enough time to do SOMETHING ANYTHING You are right
