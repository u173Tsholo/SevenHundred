55:56,1:01:50, Lyn Brown was completely captured Nine years of systematic breakdown of SOE's Zupta involvements declines occurred dramatically "Sad "@makhosi nobhatyi Yes has anyone asked why SA purchased weapons from Europe when we have Denel and they where leaders in some areas. "@ Anne M this embarrassing to black professional really @Michael Wild Which brings us back full circle to the arms deal agreed was never needed 
1:02:38,1:12:21, The submarines are apparently not even in use Fana Hlongwane was the arms deal broker...Andrew Feinstein is an ex parliamentarian who wrote 'After the Party' explains it all as he was against buying the arms I don't remember where I read an article that stated few countries have done arms deals without there being some sort of kickback or corruption involved. Andrew Feinstein also wrote 'The Shadow World'...based on global arms deals and the bribery involved "Thanks Magda "I can’t wait the day Zuma being arrested surely country will be demonize by those supporters who shield for him Andrew Feinstein was an ANC politician who resigned in disgust over the arms deal @makhosi Yes Zuma was involved in the arms deal...some of charges against him are still in progress That's a big statement he just made. 
1:14:28,1:21:58, "@magda seguin I was supporting Zuma @makhosi...we are all very traumatised and pained as ex ANC voters Zuma creates a bill to protect information which is was to protect his shenanigans because they were shocked by revelation of Nkandla scandal Its like they blackmail them I already decided that the Polokwane mess was the end and decided that I will never vote for the ruling party ...I have become apolitical Magda Seguin I told myself I will vote for other party to give Anc lessons as we did in 2016 because there was no hears to listen but after Ramaphosa won I come back home coz I know him very well "@STEFAN VAN DEN BERG The commission's investigators are giving information to the NPA Administration and policy implementation will happen in supervisory and no corruption will happen as you see him pushing very hard to bring back wat we have lost "@STEFAN VAN DEN BERG. And all those ppl that are been implicated are back on ANC seat. the likes of Gigaba 
1:23:06,1:26:47, @STEFAN VAN DEN BERG it is also for informing you (as a public member) what happened to your money unlike in your parents time (apartheid) where everything was secretive and if you question you dead.. @Desmond Masilela I know the branches put their names forward but they should have done the proper thing by declining Some in the branches are also captured "@Anne M. haa "I am very happy with what they sent to parliament @Anne M.. I think in this we should start to put blame on our current President. Dont you think so? who approve the names for ppl who are implicated? @STEFAN VAN DEN BERG The NPA has just appointed a new head - Shamila Batohi who served on the International Criminal Court Yes @Anne she is cleaning upcas we speak @Anne M.. The NPA should have done something now. Just to set an example that something will happen. 
1:26:58,1:31:46, l m waiting for Supra Mahumapelo s name to b mention @Desmond Masilela I hear you "@ Masilela no President has nothing to do with candidates secretary does that i am waiting the name of Mogosuthu Buthelezi of IFP to mentioned anywhere.The old man is so clean. "@Anne M.. Remember what happened with Agrizzi @Makhosi l will b happy if Ace Magashule is arrested @STEFAN VAN DEN BERG And that might be exactly what the president is waiting for - then he can appoint his own cabinet without the current factionalism "apartheid was in place formally since 1948 & before ofcos. Many decades of abuse "The bomb is coming out now 
1:31:54,1:35:45, "President laying on laws to prove then act because these people talking too much know how to demonize poor people so only thing we trust is the law "State capture destroyed so many lives and families...its an unknown @Desmond it is true @Stefan even if he is arrested he will be out in hours on bail and his lawyers will make sure that the cases are dragged out @Bridgette Kekana. Thank you Bridgette. Sabotaging from SABC is coming just now. @Thando Nkutha. By our government officials @Stefan I agree... @Stefan 😂😂😂😂😂 
1:36:41,1:44:27, These Zuma cronies put ANC into disrepute and ashamed @Stefan...NEVER my friend...there is no moral compass in the ANC They are heartless "Viva ANC viva We will vote for ANC.but u can vote us out. the Anc is ruining us n takes us for granted thinking we are stoooges Forget it under Ramaphosa won’t happen courts will be busy now and all those who resigned from their position after they had done wrong will account I like this Adv she's so organized. "@STEFAN VAN DEN BERG  
1:45:11,1:48:11, @Thando Nkutha. Thank you so much Thando. Now i can recall the difference between the two. "Ramapoza is just as guilty as JZ Which 2 Desmond? Gcabashe and who? Stefen if u have problem with the ANC.dont vote them again.is clear u voted for them and now u are very much dissapointed and u are not alone on that. It's politics. Theresa May has just survived 2 or 3 votes of no confidence. People have to vote along party lines. "Stefan van den berg Ramaphosa CR was happy when eff heckle JZ in parly Kekana no @Ntombethemba Manase. The other one has Afro hair that I was confusing her with this one. 
1:48:18,1:51:36, @Anne Theresa May is running a very confused Tory party and she is running around back and forth to Brussels for a Brexit deal which is not going to work Ok. Thandi Norman. Ushorty. l cud c the body language "@Thando Nkutha @Magda Seguin Yup - politics "@kekane yes you would see frustrated by Zuma response not answering questions This Adv since she's started I can not recall the chair assisting her with any question. How to put question. "The Brita who voted leave the EU are regretting it 
1:51:44,1:57:32, Unlike Sello. She is always frustating the chair. The Britas are stocking up on food...it's a disaster @ Masilela I think hair style help her so much 😀😀😀 she is confident and well prepared @Ntombethemba Manase. Everytime she put question the chair must intervene and assist. very frustration. 😂😂😂 May 28 is the deadline for Brexit "Sello and Vytie Mentor @Ntombethemba Manase. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 "@Ntombethemba Manase. So This witness and Mr Jonas "Thando 
1:59:16,2:01:47, "Desmond Manage agree "@Ntombethemba Manase. Yes they speak the truth who is implicated today guys ? Yes 😁😁😁😁😁😁 he is one of those hated too much by Zuma adminstration @Billy Mathibela. The smalanyana Fish Malusi Gigaba and Brown. ok

2:09:31,2:21:14, The Guptas had lots of shelf companies...here in SA and even Dubai...only a post box and address...nothing else kudlalwa ngathi ... kumoshwa imali kahulumeni Sometimes the address is an open held or an empty building in an industrial area And it won't surprise me if Gavin Watson hasn't done something similar. "Magda Seguin only these establishments just few weeks and get billions tender 😳😳 used sucking government coffers to be dry denel @Anne and @Makhosi...it's the nature of state capture...read the World Bank 2000 definition of state capture.The Guptas must have PhDs in state capture..lol "Nomatter how deep may criticize mr Gordhan I second that @Makhosi 
2:22:15,2:28:18, this all means nothing if we can't extradite the guptas Between Gordhan and Nene they should be hailed as heroes "@John-Basel Ioannou We'll probably be in a tug of war with India Lesotho kicked out the Guptas long ago...they were more awake than our government Apparently the extradition process is in progress "more money wasted Even if the Commission costs money I think the SA public has the right to know what happened and who was involved @Magda Seguin I heard they had Lesotho Diplomatic passports .... which were withdrawn when their true colours emerged.... not like our ANC government Exactly @Robert Russell...The Guptas also wanted to capture other African countries
