46:13,46:54, maybe he didnt know of the bad faith mr Singh was speaking with Myburgh is schooling Mr. Laher. I think Mr. Laher knows more than what he is telling. then u dont need evaluation committee @ Rob when the EFF is on this Chat the talk is more productive and not romantic and boring talks They'll have to put him on a drip at this rate. @ALTA Dankie skattebol! Make it a double! @zalisile..100% Amla is going to run out of water "come clean man 
47:01,47:58, barber shop business This poor man is totally blindsided by this. shem mr Myburgh has no other point against Amla... he is dwelling on same point @eddie..if he dont he going to get hanged "calling the witness ""Amla"" has a racist undertone to it" Why is Singh not yet arrested? Keep giving him more water please 😀 @ Naledi Barron u are emotional and sensitive we arw here in this chat not in your Bosses places Senekal @victor. Thts an important point

He sure is going to cry Was not his place to put his foot down. Will Myburg be brave enough. to ask Mr. Singh why he inflated the figures in the first place. I don't think he has the guts to do so. Paaa 
51:56,52:29, when r the arrest today? "Laher @eddie..maybe or not Maybe Amla was co-opted "Yoh Myburg take it easy dude Singh and Molefe in the hot seat.......tickets selling fast! @Victor but he dont wanna say it. 👀👀👀 @Romulus O'Brien - he would have been told to shut up He didn't use a long spoon while dining with the devils🏃‍♂️

Yhuuuuuwi 
53:19,53:43, his lying is so obvious @Akhonamandla Gala that my point. They are being unfair. even them they respect Chair during the proceedings. They dont challenge him. he should have been truthful from the beginning. "@ cassim "Mr. Laher "@Sandile Mkonto....he should have requested a break to raise his concerns further to his team...especially if he had the best interest of the organisation. Remember He had a bone in is mouth so he could not debate effectively or raise concerns His eyes tells a lot...🤔 hindsight 
53:44,54:26, Look at the body language. He cant stop blinking! A sure sign of lying!! I will never say South Africa is poor again. @mrp..if he lying..he is cooking his goose "@Pastor J "worst 🔥🔥🔥🔥 on fire lol crooked as a cork screw He must tell the truth Witnesses must not fart on national tv.= contempt of commission

1:21:15,1:22:26, i agree....amla is the wrong guy.... Zuma will definitely use his team of lawyers' interjections to deflect hard questions "As a chartered accounted he's paid to do that Myburgh = Nkalakatha Where is Gedleyihlekisa?
