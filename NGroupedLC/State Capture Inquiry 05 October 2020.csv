I knew the judge will ask for the evidence to be submitted....Seleka mara😷😷😷 "Kate Hofmeyr guys. Last week I 
20:06,21:45, Proper admission of evidence is the most important element in the proceedings but its boring as F. @Owen Nyilika As long as you admit to your mistake. My question exactly @Maryann Diamond. I was itching to comment and hear what you guys had to say @rohan barnard 😂🤣you are annoying "@Mike Clark bietjie bewolk maar die son wil wi uitkom "@Blake I take it that the affidavit is a key part of the session @Xolani J Masemula she did well on friday @Elias Sqosha That was the most corrupt person yet who clearly tried to suddenly cover her tracks. If she doesnt end up in orange I will know that the NPA/SAPS are properly captured. 
21:52,22:39, @Yolo More I am missing 🦌 "Who was crossing Cedrick last week? he was the worst @Mzalwane Mzala WY THEY WAIT MR ZONDO COMM TO ARREST THOSE THIVES "Dont underestimate chair. He was laughing with Sodi one day @SanFran Arnold I will miss our B😍 🔌🔌🔌💡💡💡 Hofmeyer is the best she is full of fire @Blake Yogi indeed Seleka is sound. you would probably perform likewise. I like the way he makes his submissions give him a chance he will expose the truth for you. he is thorough as far as I follow his work. 
22:42,23:39, The comment section is back!! Hooray! yolo🤣🤣🤣 when is miss hofmeyer coming guys? i do respect tis dudes thinking they r rich only to find that ae thieves @Xolani J Masemula it advocate Notshe not sure if those testifying feel safe anymore @David I have to agree. Hofmeyr dont take bull. Morning All no sound? 
23:53,24:51, They want witnesses to give evidence first before arrest otherwise they can't testify at commission Morning All. hi wolfy So video link is reserved for White witnesses ? Guptas are refused same . Hope Zuma requests video link to expose hired natives . "Nobody feels safe coming to the commission @Nkululeko Zondo morning why is this guy giving evidence via video link "Agreed the chair is not sending anyone to jail. it is ones evidence or others that has left them to exposed! he is just doing what he has to do. SALUTE 
25:21,26:13, @Ishaad Mohammed great question. maybe he is covid+ "@Blake "yes @Yolo @Andre Gerber I agree "Seleke thank you Ayanda @Rasheed Ally this witness is in Jhb. The Guptas wanted to give evidence from outside SA Where is Linnell testifying from? evidence 
26:31,27:39, Jhb kaapstad @Ntokozo 🤣 next thing chats disabled. This thing that Zuma will appear using the link it won't work he will mute the and say nothing and Zondo will be more furious what is happening here? @Xolani J Masemula I watched in fascination-what a liar-its no suprise big Zuma fan he too should be arrested with Smith.He was in the sham committee that defended Zuma in his theft for his compound. 😂😂😂 @kaapstad18 in Kaapstad @Rasheed Ally. Probably on medical grounds due to his age n covid risk or recovery all the better to scam people 
27:41,29:08, Guptas can't give video evidence we want them here so their sizes for the orange suits can be taken @Yolo More you 🦌 now? 🤣🤣 boom Andre digital world has no boundaries All the qualifications to be a Mr Fix it!!! Guys I was surprised they arrested Vincent Smith. He worked so hard to convince us that Agrizzi loaned him money with no agreement ls etc 😆 Gupta's or anyone for that matter don't deserve special treatment So not an attorney but legal advisor to Eskom??? Gupta's knew who to hand pick Mr Nel was not admitted as an attorney:washhands: 
29:15,30:13, @rohan barnard how?😋 Seleka just breaks this witness on first question. just wow He probably didn't stop people thinking he was an actual attorney "@Mike Clark "guy's @Yolo More I'm watching you from kaapstad 👀😋 yes thanks gugulethu nuts and bolts ah thank you 
30:13,31:28, @rohan barnard 🤣 "but at least Notshe got Cedrick nicely with the idea of getting him to solidify his statement with regards to whether or not Agrizzi was actually in that meeting @rohan barnard I'm watching you and the Zondo circus from Paarl fake lawyer Zuma Ace DuDu want to see those in court soon @Rasheed Ally After various excuses why pple couldn’t attend judge decided any person with problems attending can give evidence via a link. And two Black persons did that last year already. Unfair Yhooo! Dudu Myeni? eish... he;'s using dial-up connection @Gerard Victor Leave zuma out of this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
31:35,32:58, chewing is back "Oh no 😆😆🤣🤣 exactly Chair @bruinman Paarl is my home @ Mbuso Ndlovu he is the head of the corrupt snake! why would you say leave other people out Nothing to do! @Mzalwane Mzala Cool! So two of us are watching from Paarl. Happy Monday to all!!!!! 
33:07,34:11, Dudu and Zuma your time is running out I am in George lol @Gugulethu Xhosans @Gerard Victor Only a compitent court can find someone guilty @skeetpetegibbs Welcome! How;'s George Today? sounds like this chap is also a corruption enabler andre.... agree Zuma and Dudu your time's up hahahaha "Somewhat surprised that he in an old geezer! All the while 
34:44,35:19, those who thinks Zuma is going to jail are day dreaming "Chair tsotsi this one Consultant - the C-word - there we go Bruinman. The best it can be .Magic day and the mountains are washed clean and the air is clear. @Elvis Malakoane he is the main man to get people fired @Gerard Victor Apartheid government was more corrupt than blacks the real question DCJ is asking is exactly when did you forst become corrupt He has no one in his pocket anymore so I pray i see all the thieves in the Orange Suits the justice they deserve after raping the land. Showerhead first in line! 
35:20,36:30, first Molefe why would you say that. are there sacred cows? Still trying figure out why chat line sometimes switched off anyone with any thoughts @Jenny Whitewaves exactly "@skeetpetegibbs Wonderful. you must rather be outside  Here we go Apartheid-Throw in Jan van Riebeeck too @Gerard Victor it didn't take long did it🤣🤣🤣🤣 Joyce just forget Zuma is not going to jail Ignore the trolls 
36:40,38:00, This one will be hard to catch @ SanFran Arnold every village has the resident one! Corruption is the course of the day may the block be with you today Bruinman....sure but we are a bit busy in the workshops The EFF was correct in referring to her as Dudu Myeni-Zuma. She was the real 'First Lady' and the 'Prime Minister' if apartheid government was more corrupt but not to their own ppl like what is anc doing to us anyone defending the anc is a beneficiary of corruption if found complicit why would he not be prosecuted as others 
38:05,38:54, Mthokozisi Molefe Only court can determine whether he is going to jail or not opinion is irrelevant at this stage @Gerard Victor Please leave my uncle out of this. He was never part of state capture rather land grabs which makes him a member of the EFF in 1952 "how many fingers does Dudu have @Gugulethu he's too smart that one he covered his ways long before this DCJ memory is amazing DCJ aint got a lot of time for this one... 1952 or 1652 LOL @skeetpetegibbs Hectic for a Monday. You must put your PA on long leave... Gerber hahahaha 
39:09,40:06, DCJ is s tiger @Mbuso Ndlovu so right & now the ANC is spending R34bn on a new project in Tswana- can u imagin the thieving that will take place - the ANC NEC and cadres must be licking thier lips in anticipation. "@Mthokozisi Molefe Maybe ha ha "lol..""Mr Fixer""" gm SanFran @Mike Clark 🤣😂🤣😂😂😂 A another N national C cookie jar to plunder so innocent ag shame 
40:14,41:09, "I wish I had DCJ's memory! Spirulina for brekfast "i want to see 2people in prison Mr Fixer - sounds like a new movie in the making. DCJ is amused 🤣🤣Mr Fixer aka Mr Mlungisi Yes DCJ!!!! "Advocate Seleka "What was he fixing? the papers Oliver Pope

42:49,44:02, @Andre I hope so too. Some clarity would be awesome "The current state of of our once proud national carrier indicates the ability of the principle crook's ""fixer""!!" Almost tea time and zero drama; we need Miss Mbanjwa 💥 in the end they will sing to save their *^% 😆🤣🤣🤣 why not ace M agashule protectar DCJ is on a roll today.

Mrs Mbanjwa.....Chair the evidence leader doesn’t understand the law think Miss Mbanjwa would not practice soon "@Morongwa 🤣🤣🤣 
47:57,49:27, "Ms Mbanjwa yes chair Dudu gave me the names As distintc and advanced service...as what Dudu would need from you as a puke- cleaner to her!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Blake Yogi that was the best! Chair: Ms. Mbanjwa please sit down 🤣🤣🤣🤣 He was doing HR departments work!!! Sounds like a fixer to me GM salsa was Dudu ever an 
49:33,50:33, Mbanjwa wa bajwa. Personal narrative....... what is your narrative? Have we heard about the water board before/ was Dudu ever an Eskom board member? Lord have mercy! This man was an all rounder fixer. How can he be independent when he gets paid by Board chairperson "walking behind her fixing problems @ Xolile Titus no she was not. @Xolile Titus nope 
50:52,52:39, Mr Fix It:elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: He's falling into a pit Linel is a liar no qualifications makhosi nobhatyi he is a conman I think he was paid R170k pm "@Elvis What was the meeting all about? who is in hot water today I just join now The way he is trying to organize his answers to save himself is honestly pathetic but strategic. He will not sell Dudu out because he has a lot to loose too. 
52:41,54:26, dud myeni so this Dudu is associating herself with a retired apartheid judge of old Rhodesia..... very interesting Blake Yogi But looks like they have some bombs lined up for him Spill the beans Mr Linell 🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ Why would Dudu Myeni interfere on Eskom matters? """Mr Fixer"" aka Mlungisi is spilling all the beans. no honour amongst thieves I tell you." @Elvis. Always. Seleka has rightfully been named Mr Slow Poison cos of his strategy another comrade about to bite the dust Open Robben Island for these crooks 
54:29,55:52, 😶😶😶 @Tshepiso Mbebuwa I agree this guy is starting to make my skin itch!!!! Needed a investigation that could be 100% certain to make the findings wanted Liar We are connecting your dots Mr Linnel Blake Yogi And he looks thorough and he aim the bullet at the right spot we should send these bunch of crooks to area 51 for alien testing "@Blake Yogi How much did this guy get paid as the ""fixer""" @ Gugulethu Xhosans Dudu Myeni was allover. Trustee ka Zuma for all the wrong doings. 
56:02,57:48, People are jailed for less This rotting fish the ANC needs to get all these thieves into prison and have a new Party the Country can trust again I have the greatest respect and admiration for all the Evidence Leaders at the Zondo Commission. Do I love the DCJ ?..... Obvious!!!! @Sal SA very much so. Now we know why it was hard to suspend Dudu @Mike I know the one invoice was about R180k not sure if there were more Wow Dudu used white Rhodesian to clean up SOE's 🤣🤣🤣 Sal SA "im late  dude had state capture tentacles on both hands the ex-president was very buy in getting ways of robbing other than getting the economy right so people can benefit through job creation. sissss. 
57:57,59:26, "@Blake Yogi R180k for f' all "@Sal SA I'm also surprised because they all act as if they hate whites @Sal SA isn't ironic. the proponent of RET. hi. 👋🏽 long time. ..been 6months? state capture where are we now @Diana that's every South African's feeling and sentiments ..signs of things getting back too normal. @Sal SA Looters shout a lot about ideology and politics but they only care about money and collaborate with anyone who helps them in their looting mission.

Peter Stuyvesant Double cool and rooibos tea time Throw them all under the GRAVY BUS! A research for only 2 days. Zuma brigade sold the idea of WMC to South Africans whereas they were busy hiring “white attorneys “ to do the job for them

1:45:33,1:46:09, Zuma is not as corrupt as people think what is going to be achieved by this enquiry. To me its a waste time and money. People are unemployed out there and money is being wasted in such commission of enquiries @SanFran Arnold we can hope "Hofmeyer is top Oh boy... another Zuma sympathizer.. "Gerard adv seleke is brilliant @YAPHA MSOMI have you watched the news recently? @Mbuso Ndlovu the statement you made means that he still is corrupt. 
1:46:13,1:47:14, This guy has just said Zuma wasn't present. "We dont think he is corrupt @ Sergio De Matos a new circus act for tourists "... speaking off employment. can we have more then one power service delivery in SA? ( maybe 9 @SabeloNxumalo Judge Zondo is pulling a fake smile which is the same smile the Whites pull towards Blacks unemployment can only be blammed on technology advances nothing else The Fixer had to protect the President and others. What was Jabu's link with Eskom? "Zuma was not there 
1:47:15,1:49:12, The fireworks will come much late the adv is just chipping away bit by bit when the witness feels he has won then ......... "Zuma was there "True @Jenny...

Alfa 🦌 Nxumalo please explain that statement ....? yahpa And then Mr Can't Recall will be marinated and deep fried properly... there will never be a time in this life time where there is 100% employment rate this life is a mess 
1:49:13,1:51:06, @Rohan this is not a secret though @Alfa Nxumalo your statement is nonsensical and one made only to cause division David Butler are you sure or its just your assumptions I think Linnel was hired to play down those responsible for Eskoms demise.

"@ a b c Apartheid san i send her an email nothing yet im worried @rohan barnard 😅😅 yip... we're used to it I guess @Eddie Reddy or was Dudu following his instructions to achieve her objectives She instructed he found the way she did what he told her So a body that is not the Eskom board takes a decision to suspend Eskom Executives. 
1:52:05,1:53:45, @ALTA I'm also missing Naledi 😪😪😪 @Gerard Victor 😅😅😅 @Mbuso Ndlovu 1 January 1834 rohan i will call her now and let you know YOOOO @SanFran & Yohan i truly thought this is not that deep.
