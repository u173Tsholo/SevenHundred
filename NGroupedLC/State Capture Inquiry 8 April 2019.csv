time,1:13,message Its going to be an eventful day Apparently McBride might not come today ... "Morning Really?Why? Its gonna be lit today indeed! The chair is on time today. Word has it Mac Breezy will implicate atleast 30 people of which some are some high ranking officials SABC the sound is very bad 
1:32,8:32, @siboniso how do you know he is not coming? Someone dropped the ball I had a dream : That all ANC criminals will be jailed before they act sick Chair is punctual today ... and she was charged with defeating the ends of justice and contravention of section 33 of the IPID Act. All three cases are still with the NPA.... @Sboniso your source is not credible Sound from the left? We started early today? It seems Mcbride will drop bombshell 
8:51,12:30, What's the agenda today? we're back again Zuma backers must cry "Youâ€™re right @Sboniso I'm suspicious why is the commission keep postponing Mcbride testimony outright? law breakers He should have been here by now! @Sboniso "Mcbride is doing a about turn dirty games Seems like Mr Mcbride is postponing today 
14:24,18:12, "@Desmond Masilela @Eslon Eslon. Oh okay. Thank you Eslon. Why are they interpreting this rule now?The investigators are deliberately delaying this process. There's something about Mcbride's testimony Headline: ANC body is itching as corruption is attacking their top 6 body. expert says winning 2019 election is part of survival as corruption temperature is too high "gild the lily "Vote fo the son of soil "Mcbride's testimony will implicate a number of senior ANC people McBride said in a video that he has information on exactly how the processes at the NPA was circumvented 
19:16,20:11, Some tactics ruining here. The video is available on Youtube Somebody must be fired NOW on LIVE television. "this is how looters in SA. goes free. our legal teams I hope Mr Macbriteâ€™s absence is got nothing to with anyone of African National Corruptionâ€™s top 6 what does he know and why is he protected from this comission this comission is now comprimised and is a sad day for all of us waste of time and money he just lip flapping time away "..off the roll in terms of the above-mentioned section. The matter could only be re-enrolled with the written instruction of the NDPP Zondo also getting annoyed by his legal flopping 6 weeks is really unacceptable. 
20:23,23:04, This is unacceptable This is unacceptable! So what are you going to do about it Mr Zondo? The commission is duck and diving on the Mcbride issue pointing to the rules but when allowed Agrizzi to implicate Nomvula without notifying her. McBride must take the stand and not mention names. We will connect the dots. It is clear that the ANC is desperate judging from the Alex saga this weekend.Tony Yengeni made necklacing threats on Twitter against Mashaba "As ANC members we are not shaken by any one whom seem to undermine the fight against corruption "So "the CJ should command them to go get him @makhosi nobhatyi The ANC rooting out corruption!? That'sa laugh. 
23:07,23:53, "but makhosi ANC is state capture again nother postponement as it was expected the impression is already there that ma bride will not apear before the comission "what is it that he's still planning @Hamza Mulla Spot on! But Chair you allowed Agrizzi to implicate Nomvula without giving her time to prepare herself why? Top Story: EFF supporters to celebrate victory as all their demands of corruption became reality so far South Africans are feeling soulful on EFF members after abused by parliament security. so everyone came here for nothing?? This is totally unacceptable 
24:21,25:27, "just logged on "DA is failing themselves now This is so depressing when just one person can stop stop process so easily by not pitching !! They should just go fetch the clown. "@Afr24News Channel ""EFF demands corruption"". Sounds about right." Mcbride 's evidence should be explosive. ðŸ˜¥ @Blaze 613 Lol i do not believe that mr pretorius did not know all along on friday already that this crap is going to pop up today yes once again again and again what a sham CR just appointed Mc; 
25:28,27:02, You have a lot of time to prepare. You should get up at 5 or 6 like the rest of us. These people are jokers. @Peter Staffen exactly CR just appointed Mc Bride as Head of Anti Corruption Ethics Unit Investigators are playing games with Mcbride double standards here @goolamv - He knows that Zondo is p** off with him "Everybody "the whole process has stopped 
27:07,28:29, @Peter Staffen Whats Pretorius' designation in the commission why are we not proceeding today? "Transnet saga will reveal how Zuma did his networks @Magda Seguin Yip on condition that he goes lightly on the ANC here carnoth ngomane senior @Yin Yang...I rewrote my comment...I had a gremlin that popped up THUMBS DOWN for this one they can take this chitchat at chambers but Mr Mc bride has always said he is ready . why is he not here now
