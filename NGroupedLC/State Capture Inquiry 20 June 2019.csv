14:33,28:57, "he is implicated who is he why was he running company here is he possessing skills that we dont have as south african "None of that really matters No matter whre u come from as long for are black men u are an African hebanna Born free or Born Biased? Born realist and you learn all of those. learn to get it all before you go out to public! Africa has had the opportunity to rise but continues to fall and fail 
29:09,46:54, I really don‚Äôt understand why these officials wasted our money like they are flushing toilet paper. Leave poor more poor where they enrich themselves exactly and that is why the poor are rising "state capture inquiry is at that stage which he "General Manager Commercial SA Express @ levon shikwambana alright I heard you This guy is sounded as a Congolese I think he was hired to get rought in kinshasa Route "@ Abel Matshidiso definitely he not South African I don't detect a French accent or Portuguese.

1:18:17,1:25:48, was in Sandton last week ppl were very nice Neptune Randburg 09.30 Was to start at 8am but late again Ground handling is any service from ground to aircraft what portfolio this guy hold at SAX Brian Van Wyk is a black man and not Afrikaans Yes indeed he is i just checked him on facebook his another name is Tebogo 
1:26:27,1:39:53, Oh thanks Pastor JJ Yes his accent is not . Kenyan national? i was just about to ask you guys the same thing looks like Meyni turned SAA in to a charity for the rich to be richer.... sad part is that it is at our expense ...the rich keeps taking from the poor "we continue to be poor Yes and also ministers of the ANC Luthuli house looting and diverting funds for the ANC campaigns R31 million to be exact. Theres no difference between local and foreign. There is just greedy and dishonest people. regardless of where they come. 
1:40:07,1:44:58, This is money that can create jobs and keep closing componies afloat.. They worked us well. The current state of our country signals problems with the roots. It was money from the public purse meant to improve the lives of of the poor and keep State owned entities afloat. Thats correct Moeneeb are they even going to be charged? Hopefully Judge Zondo will bring those recommendations when he concludes his report. @Thando Nkutha is a fight between mkhwebane and Madonsela? "When is the big"" Shark"" being called in (Zuma)?" The NPA will take over after the conclusion of the State Commission. Recommendations shall ahve been made by the D j Zondo. 
1:45:29,1:47:36, People can be charged at any time. There is no obligation to wait for the final Zondo report. .....but that will be the NPA/Parliament's job to charge implicated people...? "Morning NPA is going to let them pay half the money and let them go.. is that going to be fair? "Zuma won‚Äôt come here as he refused to come and state his case Zuma has to pay R16million in legal expenses. Thank goodness he can no longer use taxpayers money to keep him from facing justice. Theres a Unit the NPA announced I think last month they are going to do further investigation on some of the commission work that has been concluded. He is the cause of it all. Zuma won't pay. He appeals almost everything. 
1:48:07,1:51:49, Zuma can‚Äôt afford the bus fare he owes 16 million in lawyers fees. Not parliament's job to decide who gets charged or not. Only NPA decides after either SAPS or Hawks investigation. "whta if he doesn't pay because he does not have the taxpayers money in his pocket and his money is almost finished.. the commission is the means to do damage control - as a result of what JZ did treason Zuma has been ordered by the court to pay he has to comply. "He's got a lot of money this guy No it did not succeed as Ramaphosa was ripped off. 
1:52:12,1:57:28, tipped off "if the gupta aircraft did not land Are the Zulu‚Äôs still running the mafia ? ü•ëüó® @clive oconnell Ace isn't Zulu no ace is a tamboekie @Danie lol wat is that? Let's pray for commission of inquiry. it is a relitive of the tokoloshie who does bad things

I wish that Police Commissioner would change his gangster hat he looks like a gangster from the hood Or a paid sperm donor @Kevin Allister Simon uneducated president spent money he cannt even pronounce.. @Anne The Ace can be high or low. Zulu Kings always high. 
2:01:32,2:03:14, "Is zuma coming for Sona today Zuma will have to sell Nkandla to pay for his legal expenses. "Ace must just be hit by bus. He is way too arrogant even though he knows his feet ""zinodaka"" suka." rc Zuma will not be at SONA Yes I will lend you the bus does he even deserve to be invited? "@Born free üòÜüòÜ "what ace did to the freestate wich is he did stuf to us all of us wich is definatly not by a perso who cares for his people

Thuli was tougher than Mkhwebane agreed Eff are the red ants and from today you will see them complying who are YOU to decide what is discussed on this forum @Moeneeb Martin lol seems like a high IQ the ace card is not always the winning card loool 
2:10:53,2:13:35, The EFF have to comply or they will be broke from all the lawsuits and won't have funds to fund their party of thugs. "How Irony not this time.. Careful Born Free...... according to Moeneeb.... the EFF is off limits today "a pair of 2 "If the Truth and Reconciliation Commission had gone this way The commer Just waiting for scopa position to be announce I just love it when the EFF lose all their appeals and then are hit with costs.
