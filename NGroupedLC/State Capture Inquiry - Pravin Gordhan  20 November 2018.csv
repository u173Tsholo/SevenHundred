I am not missing my lectures todayü§ô Who elect a president such as that one to lead a country such as ours Pravin is trying to explain economic vicious circle SA was subjected to by clumsy zuma decision as he got no clue about economy The fundamental question the ANC must answer in this inquiry is what did they aim to achieve by deploying an illiterate person to be the Head of state!

Foreign money pursues foreign interests.""" "@TRUCKER Careful 
30:32,32:51, "I give it to Mr Pravin Gordhan he is a smart guy he knows how to tow the line strategically @Job Mokolutlo do you seriously believe Zuma is illitarate zondo has two years to uncover state capture....i think the extent of state capture is beyond everybody's imagination...so lets wait patiently and see load shadding again These power outages when crucial information is given it's deliberate. @Mfundo Veerasamy We are not here to connect dots. We want evidence. This is not a playground. Produce solid and concrete evidence and go home. Drives me crazy. @tebogo ramakgolo very true we should brace ourselves. @Trucker if pg is devil what is Zuma and Malema? 
33:15,36:59, @Peter Sant Zuma is a champion of the people. @Mfundo Veerasamy true they say the DEVIL IS IN THE DETAIL "Pravin is not a lobbyistüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Politics is a calling to him not a career @Trucker he is indeed the champion of corruption @Trucker you mean Guptas what the f@#K is he talking of now?

37:12,39:43, @Job Mokolutlo they are not listening they have GRADE NINE Am a Zimbabwean but I like the way SA holds people accountable for their deeds "M NOT A COMODITY FOR SALE In a move to start the state capture the cost to us was over R100 BILLION????? """I am not a commodity for sale"" Pravin" we do not care what he fears or if he is for sale or not we want evidence to state capture Zuma is not Gettting any younger We all know @dave east is a moron Do you know more than Pravin Solethu? deffinately worth a watch since we all are paying for it 
39:56,41:42, PG says he is not a commodity for sale! How many of the ANC deployees can say this without contradiction! dave has captured this platform that's why he's still here "@dave east if I knew more-than him I will not waste my time listening to State capture. whats your point "we not interersted in nuclear deal. we want evidence of state capture if you want proof i can send and make a video about it Eish @ Dave hold your horses you sound impatient with his approach. Guys the DEVIL IS IN THE DETAIL this is already evidence 
41:55,44:53, The Millions of Rands that have lined the pockets of the Tender preneurs and Zuma and Gupta contacts have deprived millions of our country men of homes and basic services. "People are waiting for Bombs "Oh GOSH so he is the lawyer now  @Nkutha. Talk and sloganeering is very much critical. How else did Zuma become the President without any formal education?

YES OR NO??? 
45:08,47:51, PG is giving evidence that will show that that the state was captured. South Africa is on a decline curve that was initiated by Zuma It is obvious that Collective Leadership history in ANC never saw the light of the day during Zuma era. It was only about him and his friends guptas included @Mfundo Veerasamy we do not have 5hours of how things work. if he just gave evidence in a well prepared manner he would have done so by last month @Athmanand Singh YESSSSS "so minister no evidence here but rather shows Zuma was incompetent nje "Yesterday Mr Pravin explained the structure of the role players of the state capture and now he is dissecting the nitty gritties "This man is politician 
47:54,49:31, "@peter pott you picked it up jah neh this is dangerous what talking about ? @socabonita the ministers are outsourced to do that guy do you know that the IMF is telling the South African government to stop expropriation of land without compensation "No one can do a thing to Zuma talking about Discovery Peter what or who is HQ??

54:06,56:28, so now PG is saying Zuma appointed him even though he(PG) was not fit? "Yes we all know indians have a caste system which divides the indians in four groups if I am not mistaken @dave east The Indians you so blatantly discriminated against were brought here as slaves and still they outwitted you.

56:48,59:00, sometimes it's useless to use racist statements to defend corrupt people i don't think the EFF has got something on Pravin. they just have a grudge against him. So ask yourself this question are all dogs violent? Or for example will all men go BOLD when they are older - The answer is no - Stop Generalizing.

""Russia is the last country you want to do business with"" But you haven't even bothered to say why." were the airlines leased to guptas? "Dave if you have missed this "@Thando Nkutha Yeah whatever guy @Dave!

1:08:24,1:10:00, Many years ago there was an American who was the CEO of SAA and at that time SAA was making a profit. "this Trevor Manuel he is praising got us into this agreement. tell the truth minister. and from whom are we leasing from? SAA can tell us this cabal is fooling us. Trevor Manuel must be called too here along with his wife bkack people are in this deprieved positions because you love to play too much if you want proof of anything ive said ask me "@singh @Thando Nkutha You're saying a lot but you're not saying anything. So Ms Myeni wanted to buy aircraft for SAA and why is that so wrong? @Singh. How many Black Africans benefitted from the profits made by the US CEO? 
1:11:07,1:13:01, Buying an aircraft would have upset-ed WMC coz they only want SAA to lease aircrafts... @Thando Nkutha The nuclear program only became a problem when word surfaced that the tender would be awarded to our BRICS partners Russia. the only time PG mentioned guptas was when he said He is not for SALE. when Zuma along dudu were saying: we want our planes black. they were chastised for disturbing the capitalist. Is Pravin suffering from amnesia? he seem to forget a lot of pivotal information peter pott WMC is a disease that clever blacks keep on defending here!! Who can remember everything unless it was in writing? 1997? this man is lying. people from president come and make presentation you as a minister you never inquired who made that presentation? 
1:13:03,1:15:10, "I don't understand PG @Nkutha. I so hope you could move on from your toxic dialogue with this guy. You are much better than that!
