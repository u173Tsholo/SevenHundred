starttime, endtime,message
time,5:04,message is the land ready👍 They were asked for proof before Pravin opened a case. Cannot open separate cases. Malema must witness here. Malema thinks we are babies. last year he marched several times defending the expulsion of pravin. Now he's telling us that pravin is corrupt/ Which is he talking about. "lol hey thando my boy "Malema blows with the wind PG case not related to State Capture. Malema's is. He will have to take on PG at this commission. 
5:16,8:39, "EFF are reverting to their ANCYL days "This guy despises treasury LOL. Understandably @ mfundo kunene if you think no one takes malema seriously you must be living in different country. Admitting guilt @Nkululeko Njapha only stupid/brainwashed people do PG corruption case not linked to State Capture? "This guy does not like ""processes"".He was supposed to answer questions but asks to give a statement." The one Malema is opening tomorrow Not that i follow Juluis it is reall naive and bordering on stupidity to suggest that follwers of juluis are stupid or brainwashed. 
9:04,11:08, He still has to answer Adv. Maleka's questions. oh I thought all state capture will be covered here @Nkululeko Njapha to actually think Malema'sfollowers/sheep arent stupid is what I would call bordering on stupid/naiveity Mzwanele is clear is a diamond! Who was heading Treasury when this 90/10 exclusion was effected? Manyi is enlightening bafowethu "all i am saying is you have every right to disagree This guy just killed PG What Manyi fails to say is the Guptas were naturalised Indian S.A. but now they claim they fighting for the guy in the township. PG acting in his official or private capacity? 
11:15,13:58, "Quite right 90/10 is killing us "@Nkululeko Njapha not calling out people for stupidity is what leads to the rise of clowns "i stay in limpopo Venda all i am saying we must be mature in our debates lets not insults those that we don't agree with. Malema is a distorted politician. pure useless put facts not news paper headlines They bringing China to keep people stupid "I hate ppl who talk the talk but when you look at the trail they left 
14:20,17:46, I think Thando you are challenged "we shouldnt hide the fact that some parties/leaders arent gifted with the best senses. its more of a popularity contest Mr Manyi has a point This judge is not himself today I'm not sure nje... Thando that's what propaganda does. It has reduced your ability to think logical and analyse the whats going on into our country Thando Nkutha Its not that people just follow characters.. some leaders provide evidence and we just comment based on their evidence Manyi talking about black business is like Zwane saying he never stood up for the Guptas. When you are mature and thoughtful. you will know that no human is infallible. If you spend all your time looking faults it something don't expect to find anything else. "@Ntshibongo Tobela exactly! we are more concerned about personalities 
17:59,20:14, Legislation uses equality instead of equity. @Donovan Peters if you can share to us when did he stand for guptaz i would appreciate "Classic stuff! "Manyi despises Treasury merely because "👍 👍 👍 @Mfundo Kunene​@Ntshibongo Tobela exactly! we are more concerned about personalities "Manyi is dealing with the ruling elite "DOWN WITH TREASURY These ministers-Remember the ANC being silent when the Guptas were alleged to have told a catering firm to make sure that the ppl serving them are white. "😀 😀 😀 @Thato M​Manyi is dealing with the ruling elite 
20:30,22:11, speak those names wena... @Ewald Kruger who is this descendant of the oppressor in my mentions? I love how Manyi is giving us backed up documentation!1 @Mandilakhe Afika Centane You know what? He despises Treasury because that was the key gov department to process funds for Guptas give up on giving us what is happening Mention the names Manyi. intelligence cadres are at play here. they are feeding both manyi and Eff with information hard to dispute by those involved. instead they attack their persona what do you mean he must "thato please please don't side track the debate 
22:12,23:16, "@Sthakathi Khumalo He very convincing  @Thando Nkutha im yet to hear you engaging criticaly. give up* BEAUTIFUL @Thato M​@Ewald Kruger who is this descendant of the oppressor in my mentions? 😀 😀 😀 dead "in as much as @Ewald Kruger may be a descendant of my oppressors It puzzles me how some people hate Mzwanele so much but still ettentively listen to his presentation. that why i said Thando is challenged Exaclty Lucky "pfa 
23:39,24:56, KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU In your case who should we believe?? Because the people weve been relying on are not helping but the only guy who seems to point on facts also present documentation. people have already made up their minds and willing to listen "@Thando Nkutha name calling is an apartheid mechanisms. Our forefathers were called names for many years. Engage the substance not* wat nonsense "👍 enkosi bhuti! @Mfundo Kunene​in as much as @Ewald Kruger may be a descendant of my oppressors He defended the inclusion of the Guptas in BEE at the expense of the S.A black businesses. @Thando Nkutha speaks without any substance. He dismisses anybody he disagrees with by name calling. Forgive his intellect 😀 👍 @Thando Nkutha​ @Ewald don’t even waste your time with that idiot 
25:01,25:47, Lol thando where you from he is zupta no one in the legal team is challenging him on the names. What are they scared of? @Thando Nkutha we don't expect you to - with that reasoning I admire Mzwanele's courage to tell his side and risk being persecuted by haters. White collar corporate state capture; who r involved and what is their modality for they need to account for any wrong doing like any one else. Manyi when was this corporate capture detected I don't understand this guy who bought Gupta companies which were not purchase legally @Lucky Dlamini indeed "i'm loving this Mzwanele dude 
26:11,27:17, Manyi speak and we will engage your facts! White collar coperate capture!1 No haters here.He still has to answer adv. Maleka's questions. Crook big crook @Dumisani Tshuma purchased illegaly? True @sakhile mtshali Listening is a very important skill Thando crook I think we should ignore Thando. 
27:31,29:20, part-time advisor..🙄 Thando Nkutha seems like people have dealt with you regarding your lifespan of debating.. crook or no crook he has credible documents and not join the dots story. "@Marvel Ramatshela yes "If Jimmy had the money to buy he still has to respond to questions by Adv Vincent Maleka Did Manyi ever submitted his white collar corporate state capture to any establishment before this comm was established "@Mandilakhe Afika Centane @Nelson Musoliwa was there a requirement on his part to? Have you reported banks who are untransformed today to the Police? 
29:22,31:18, anxiously waiting for cross examination time has been wasted here singing the old song Why is this Dude buying time let Maleka on board and see what you have for Mzansi wonder what it feels like to waffle lies "@ngesi "@Thando Nkutha People say Manyupta is convincing LOL. He blocked me on whatsapp Twitter back in 2015 Manyi is so arrogant lona gale moitse pila "Maleka can relax "Judge Zondo doesnt look like he has a firm grasp of this enquiry wonder the chair did not ask mzwanele to mention the names. 
31:33,32:42, @Lesedi Ditibane Glad you can see some of his traits... He's Dr Arrogante lol Maleka allowing Manyi to paint himself into a corner. Pravin was here for Three days no one was complaining "Pressured Speech. Rapid and copious talk "@thato m haibo this guy "@Donovan Peters ""paint""?" @Donovan Peters you could be right. hes allowing him to speak as much as he can "@Thando Nkutha This guys think he's clever above all. He blocked  
32:56,35:19, Manyi can run but he can't hide Thato to tell so many lies that you can't remember the last from the first. You realise Manyi struck a nerve when the media and its WMC lackeys are here in defence. "@Tobo Lwandile LOL. He runs like a jet... Correct "Say what you like about Manyi ok you made your point. bla lbs bla why does it sound like someone farting ? @Keith he's just waisting his time he could have finished today "Hey but white people 
35:24,36:49, Thuli Madonsela haha we are getting new information on how white owned companies are capturing our state just like the Guptaz. There is always context to documents no matter what. People make statements without substantiating. "@Thando Nkutha Jeez Manyi contradicting himself aaaiiii ☺☺☺pictures Madonsela received an email to the Guptas for an invite. Manyi. Manyi!!!! *rom 
36:52,37:21, *from I love Manyi His running scared his making himself a victim "lol 😂😂😂😂😂 now he exposed Thuli with Gupta's Manyi for Minister of Finance Thuli Madonsela dining with the Guptaz That's not you area Mzwanele. Already complaining about the impartiality of the commission.

46:32,47:27, @Khanyi. AgeGracefully Oh does he tweet? He blocked me back in 2015 Manyi may have a serious personality disorder. Jimmy is clever at acting stupid "Tangible lost concentration 🤣🤣😂😂😂😂 lol he's panicking I am not even sure he is acting @Monique Jones​Jimmy is clever at acting stupid lol Manyi sofa sigijima lol🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
47:28,48:17, Mzwanele "Manyi really Can you be charged for committing perjury at the commission? hes being honest. "Acting up won't assist him anyway. and he must stop being dramatic manyi akekho ignorant he is just being honest "two clever blacks "which manyi is this one now? cause he sounds different from Manyi who was stating his case? is like under questioning "@Ewald Kruger Imagine parents 
48:31,49:47, Manyi is so happy with Guptas conduct @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU what's up man? "why is it that this commission has more questions for certain people and not others iyooo Manyi bathong "he was never ready Manyi wa bangena "But the hypocrisy in you guys mfana kithi nceda labafana bama Gupta 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 Dats True Ntokozo people a hypocrites 
50:01,50:33, precisely Ntokozo. I am annoyed by the questioning of Maleka. I was hoping that he will rather take him to task on what he has said "Not sure I follow you now @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU ​@Ewald Kruger Imagine parents "HAA HAA "people should understand that corruption didn't start 5 years back "help the Gupta brothers @Ewald Kruger LOL "@sibisi This mzwanele just acting stupid he know exactly what happened to our money. People are still going to get crossed here because we are going to testify on those gordan things.Since they were always right without fact. 
50:36,51:37, Why cant they challenge his evidence Can't someone whisper in his ear that he is making an idiot of himself Manyi is bringing the other side of the narrative Gupta spokesman "@Ewald Kruger Parents = Guptas @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU "you know the way Manyi is giving answers he will end up digging himself a grave and the end he will feel like he was treated unfairly @thembeka shibe I'm agreeing 100% with you on his grave digging @Ewald Kruger You get my analogy? 
51:41,52:40, "😀 😀 😀 get you now @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU​@Ewald Kruger Parents = Guptas White people are always attacking people labelled by the media as corrupt @mvubu1234 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 guru @Monique Jones Hey sister! "There is no grave @Thando Nkutha that is your own limited reading of his inputs Manyi got right to answer the way he chooses but truth will never get hidden at all. To defend oneself is different from giving testimony. We will see this later @Thando Nkutha No he's actually saying it was captured by whites first @Monique Jones Hope you're well 😃 
52:41,53:55, @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU how are you man? tna was never saving job was for a looting machine Can Manyi concentrate on his evidence and stop giving judgments on others peoples evidences @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I've been better. Was in hospital ER all evening with mom. She's okay and stayed the night with me Clown's explanation "@Monique Jones I am okay Go thata ! he is giving context Jimmy Manyi is.... 
54:16,55:07, he said balanced reporting "@Thando Nkutha whatever makes you sleep at night. The idea that your narrative is gospel and can't go unchallenged is a myth. We engage Look at Maleka lol The lawyer is weak thembeka. Mzwaneli sounds like a Saint Is advocate Maleka trying to hide the laughter on his face behind his hands? guy is rubbing his forehead after a question 😂😂😂😂😂 Dumela bathong Manyi you are the only one that has given me hope in this hearing...Maseko and others are clowns 
55:26,56:19, "Monique Jones And as a professional lawyer "Maleka is being hammered here. Shattered when the statement ""there are dates"" - FACTS Cabal of 4 big companies. What is he saying mara? "@monique No Is this guy for real 😨😨😨😨😨 Stigma on New Age was well painted because the newspaper was owned by Guptas... Hebaana>???????? yep @Sthakathi Khumalo even lawyers have a sense of humor when someone is lying and it's showing badly 
56:20,56:58, @marvel soup mana maleka must just take the L Yes he does tweet every time every the commission resumes "@ramatshela @mvubu1234 HAHAHAHAHA! Blowing smoke indeed This is why we should not have made weed legal in SA 😂 Manyi is chowing them stru 🌐 Kabul manyi is confused he think he will confuse advocate maleka 
57:01,57:52, manyi is confusing my data it's gonna deplete soon "Manyi He's even boring mr Maleka Thats what you get when you dont entertain someones evidence as a alawyer. Maleka can ridicule but he must challenge him on his evidence "Alternative view of a media outlet "no COME ON MANYI!!!! "i called for it its called the truth 
58:05,58:44, Maleka is emotional and unprofessional he is badly exposing himself @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU he's ridiculous! I'm sorry but just answer the questions not make up your own Manyi should answer questions..... "Manyi yhoo hayi kengoku MR. Manyi now running around.. too defensive. @KD stru manyi is chowing our data i support him... keep him safe 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 Manyi has already cracked as he is struggling to distance himself from the advocate questions and it is his attempt to defend himself from all this 
58:46,59:06, Zondo is compromised Manyi must take my data serious we got two years chair. we rushing nowhere Pravin was given a chance to elaborate on his answers lol manyi trying to protect himself from himself 😁😁😁😁 "There's something called oral evidence and when people know that what they're doing might be viewed on the wrong side of the law Manyi got a Job without interview lol "He must contextualise 😅😅😅😅😅 
59:08,1:00:00, telling the advocate its unfair to answer with yes and no only 🤣🤣 This is nonsense "FEEL FREE Down down pravhin ..Is this operation tikka masala??? "A ""loaded"" question is one you are afraid of answering truthfully and hence will incriminate yourself" Why are they entertaining all this lies from Manyi Mr Maleka is weak "Maleka knows with Manyi going on but pravin spoke at length 
1:00:27,1:01:53, He loves all the Gupta owned media outlets LOL I like Manyi s behaviour Gordan was lecturing us here. Mainstream media gets things wrong I think Mr. Many needs a break.. They don't get things wrong... they Err with intention Come on!! What is the role of the media? To be soft on government? Hehehe If you really payed attention you will see that Jimmy has lied already. He said he struggled to pay attention to Gordhan's testimony but yet he says he didn't watch inquiry 😂😂😂😂 manyi is playing dumb now 
1:01:58,1:03:23, Media what why were they allowing Pravin to lecture then? you're intention ? @Monique Jones LOL @Michael Jackson couldn't have said it better Naledi pandor is next..Also fire the sleeping minister with the Afro i don't see a reason why not Manyi can contextualize his answers others before him went on and on to a point i had to rethink what was the question to bigin with but he said yes 10% critical of state 
1:03:26,1:05:49, Mama always said it's hard to remember your lies cause you have to tell so many to keep up with the first one Oh how POETIC you are Manyi 😀 😀 😀 There's a difference between leading a witness and cross examining a witness. Pravin was being led and Manyi is under-cross examination. True Mbulelo "One can lecture such as he/she wants during submission. But during cross-examination Zuma is the mastermind of state capture..He should be on trial for state capture Who are the lawyers on here and why are you not working but Manyi is just running around the bush and you can even see tht Maleka is getting bored "If you are telling the truth 
1:05:50,1:07:02, TNA was a propagandist small media outlet... who owned it? Guotas... COME ON MANYI!! "pravin must answer the questions in parliament Come to the point. @MALUSI vukani I don't think so much as bored but the audacity of his lies is funny. He needs to watch the tape later 😀 👍 @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU​TNA was a propagandist small media outlet... who owned it? Guotas... COME ON MANYI!! @Martine Engelbrecht Indeed! It should be a breeze LOL. Now its boiling hot for Manyi!! Hopefully the ministers appearing at this inquest will be punished Manyi is so defensive Are we on cross examinations now or what is going on here? 
1:07:28,1:08:40, peter pott -peter pott-ANCYL in Red has yet to bring any evidence. Wasn't Manyi's purchase of GuptaTV7 and TNA financed by Gupta Holdings @mini "But its not fair to request Manyi not to explain They did there homework DA members are probably involved in state capture case @Monique Jones He inherited the GUPTA owned media Media: you're under review @Monique Jones pOSED AS IF HE BOUGHT IT lol 
1:08:43,1:10:17, clean house @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU He's a spin machine getting caught up in his lies "is this revenge The chair clarified that he can explain but you can't explain every question. If the question is: Is it Monday today? you need not explain the answer. let's see if you can get the content right Zondi having chest pains *Zondo @mbulelo Bikwani that is my concern @xolile macingwane there is a difference between explaining so to give clarity. and a difference with explaining unnecessary things. 
1:10:22,1:12:20, @Mbulelo Bikwani buy why is it Monday? Is it because the mainstream WMC media says so? I say prove it! Zondo is showing bias. He will be attacked by the EFF for this Zondo has a vendetta on TNA WMC!!!!! i love Dr Maleka strategy easy e reng questioning mo ngwaneng 😂 Manyi o digama asa ditlhapela people very fair. Pravin did not receive such u friendly environment. jimmy must be given a chance to explain iyii Sorry who is Zondo saying interviewed him when he started as DCJ? Thato M I am lost also 
1:12:20,1:13:18, State capture is embarrassing for Mzansi.. he says it TNA new age interviewed him Manyi spinning "@Mbulelo Bikwani Its Monday "@MALUSI vukani this is not a trail Jimmy emphatically hammering on facts..... The fact remains that all media you can't trust @Kizito Ncube absolutely 
1:13:34,1:14:45, 😂😂 @Asanda Mndende ...And you can't trust twitter "Media is there to hold those bestowed to handle our money @keith That's not the question. The question is: is it monday? 😂😂🤗 @xolile macingwane i understand that but we will then have to give Manyi 3months to be cross-examined if we can allow him to explain out of contest "Maleka= cool Where is Thabile ngwato if anybody has seen her tell I'm looking for her..I might marry her.. 😀😀😀😀😀self regulated media 
1:14:54,1:16:34, I give up 😂😂😂😂 Manyi missed the fact that the chair was interviewed by New Age "Deal with him Manyi!!!!! Adv Maleka is having his monies worth for the first time "It is longer yes baas Jimmy is destroying this state capture. the state capture never existed. it's a mith "Manyi has wonderfully put the media into the spotlight This is a guy that is loyal to Zuma and Gupta fingered😅 "@gcabashe 
1:16:38,1:17:34, "When you give evidence from a defensive perspective uyazi "Thabile uphi just because the evidence does not suit you. it does not mean people are Zuma loyalists now maleka evidence is turned upside down. now the credibility of media is layed bare on the table but this newspaper stories/ dialogue between Zondo and Manyi are wasting our time... @ Sanele.. I knew someone was gonna bring that up😅😅😅😅😅 "This will lead hopefully ixesha chairperson 
1:17:39,1:18:22, chief Justice ⚖ pls let Maleka asked questions Hahaha credibility of Journalist cannot be trusted the essence of this mxelele @Siya Dilimeni "Mr Q I was like ""what""?" chair is emotional now @Khanyi..ke grand..I'm love with Thabile and she works for SABC Let's just get to the questions please Zondo Chairperson is raising pertinent questions on the role of the so called 4th Estate. Some don't see it's importance "But what Zondo is addressing is what is happening at the moment in SA Media 
1:18:23,1:19:41, @Thando Nkutha LOL "😀 @Gomo Miya​but this newspaper stories/ dialogue between Zondo and Manyi are wasting our time... 😀 You are not following @Thando Nkutha What is Zondo is on about? adv maleka doesn't want an answer to that question Jimmy Manyi is schooling folks Zondo makes sense. just like how the media doesn't challenge Pravin to answer EFFs questions as he's obliged to do as a minister Shut them down!! Manyi: Maleka doesn't understand what he is talking about.!!! Zondo is trying by all means to kill the momentum of Mr Maleka and now shows that this stzte capture inquiry will waste lots of tax payers money more than what has been looted already 
1:19:51,1:20:46, Why one media suffered from gov advertising? Why? Out of all newspaper? Answer is easy... Gupta owned media doesn't deserve gov advertising @Lerato..Wa ren fela? "@khathutshelo mathephe I am confused maleka is on fire he must be here tomorrow he is mad this manyi Maleka and Manyi though.. love their relationship @Gomo Miya he must come back

C'mon "@Keith Silindile Dinabantu  There is a huge problem here.....Dodging and Diving......I'm starting to think that Mr. Maleka and Mr. Manyi have a personal vendetta Manyi is no pushover...he's well prepared and knows his story. Is this cross examination or evidence being led??? 
1:27:44,1:29:10, This Maleka is boring lolol lying about his own story City Press must come answer... Don't speak for them Adv Maleka "Maleka wasnt ready for cross-examination but for LEADING a client...if Manyi comes tomorrow "Yessese some1 is given a long rope to hang himself this manyi must goooooo to jail... he is playing hide and seek manyi just got served "This question is useless. You are comparing a start up with an established business with its history dating back pre 1994 
1:29:11,1:30:19, @ROYAL FOREX Zondo is now suspicious today a fresh load of his own kuk 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Zondo legalised Marijuana anyway Adv Maleka now showing Mr Manyi why he went to law school """breakfast sponsorships""" jimmy context manyi Manyi is too defensive.

Another huge IT system possibly scored by white business given the name" I feel for Manyi.....poor guy can't back up his evidence..... He can’t shift the blame to city press this things happen in his eyes as Director he must really come. back tomorrow todae was not a productive day for us data wasted Adv Maleka is trying to find wrongdoing where there's none. Maleka is a very experienced cross-examiner and he's one of the few that understands cross-exam. @gift Mtshali figures were provided by him Manyi and TNA did very well. The only problem is that he didn’t partner with WMC. SA will remain a racist country forever. Bantu Education killed us. Why not look at white media as well??? 
1:33:46,1:34:52, Comparing City Press with that poor New Age is appalling Black excellence. I impressed. "Even if City Press was billing on average what it was receiving weekly which is R50 000 over 31 days it would be R1.5million Slippin Jimmy "gift - He is not The Rainbow Nation - Censored V2 (+ Articles/Footage) Jimmy Manyi testimony shows that government entities were lead by people who does not understand what they were doing Now mechanical Automatic 
1:35:02,1:35:42, @Bongani Pasha Well Maleka should show that the witness's version was that TNA only received 4.7% of the R199m. "Manyi is correct Where Manyi gets millions to buy TNA All power to the black people of SA! Amandla "manyi is from eastern cape maleka has an agenda Zondo dissecting issues for comprehension . Spoken like a true spin doctor. 
1:35:50,1:36:45, LOL Compare with other service providers. Why focus on the Asian supported media only??? Ijoo he want dictate question manyi gonna goto school now Now we are debating marketing give us advocate WMC media owns our brains period! Is right there😂😂 "manyi will give some context just now

""You CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!"" In my best Jack Nicholson voice" His name is Jimmy Manyi lol listen to this crap so this lawyer is now say Daily sun is a news paper Jimmy put himself there but he can't answer questions 
1:38:42,1:39:08, anden answering with shoulders Manyi now is acting primary School student 😂😂😂😂😂 he was busy on twitter that he can wait to tell his side of the story. LOL look at his arms target marketing is what matters here numbers not adding up Teach this poor Adv about the markets marketing and focusing. How can you use Daily Sun to market government programs. Daily Sun is about witchcraft like a child manyi not even worried to look at the pages 😂😂😂😂 how he looks at maleka 
1:39:11,1:39:37, "Remember I don't see many white person talking at this commission. Lies are told by black and white. Stop feeling sorry for yourself Manyi implicates himself many ways here I think he dwells too much by defending himself and his buy company Vote ANC tha future iss Zuma! The Rainbow Nation - Censored V2 (+ Articles/Footage) Daily Sun is only for Witchcraft daily sun is a newspaper? we mostly forget about what we lied about. are u guys so desperste to be using daily sun as evidence?

He is too vocatech so manyi got his march today.😀 Manyi is not concentrating he annoyed 😀 And he is lying "Adv Maleka is clutching at straws You don't talk too much when you give evidence. You must just say enough. But Daily Sun really!!! This is not on nje Mr Manyi is by far the toughest contributor to the commission. He is not from the status quo😀 
1:40:15,1:41:13, Manyi come on They stole from everyone Mechnaical again!! we need answers Mr Manyi Manyi is saying Money is mechanical This is the fight between Indian and White business on African soil. We are just used to cheer those with strong media presence "Mr manyi is not a mechanic I wonder which market was targeted in the TNA... Maleka is looking at the numbers without understanding the background that goes into giving business to various media houses. 
1:41:31,1:42:26, We are doing mathematics now how can he destroy the evidence which is concrete and put his views Things are starting to get tough for Manyi Data is expensive and Manyi's approach to answering questions is not doing justice to the my 2GB --- Manyi is adept on intelligence overload "target marketing. yes it got that This guy is so embarrassing you know...He is not here to help the commission with finding the truth he is just protecting himself with lies Again Maleka is weak but who forced this gupta boy to testify. too pround to answer simply . maleka is reading from his statement. stupid gupta puppets. white people are so racist in SA

Maleka is arguing R 8 million was lot. when Naspers got R 17million and Tiso Blackstar R 11 million. This is a joke. 
1:46:21,1:47:15, When the people are starving like in the rest of Africa where will black and people run to. It is coming why is he justifying his face on the newspaper???? so TNA got R8 millions in first year just because it is a new media .....what a wow But why did Guptas try to steal our Oubaases business?? I was risky EFF is da boooomB!!!! the legal team of the commission for the first time is tested of bringing a witness who doesn't sing from the same hymm book with them Mzwandile has been Cracked. Guptas wanted to sweep this country to India he says people embraced it and said ^Wow^ give the guy R8mil

Drinking water hot hot HE SHOULD HAVE ASK GORDHAN FOR TUTORIALS gerry nel is not the kind of person to build south africa malekas look is priceless Maleka has dealt with this man 
1:52:12,1:52:51, "Pssy Cross-examination is no child's play Monyi "@hilton modike he is white transformation agenda 🙄 Maleka is saying to the witness: you came to tell us that this narrative that TNA received and gobbled all the budget was false. However he can't deny that in it's league it gobbled all of it. "@moloi Deliberate strategy by gov to go to black owned media. Why would spend still go to white owned companies? LOOKS ARE DECEIVING....I TRUSTED THIS GUY "If GCIS was a conduit
