time,0:34,message former Free State Economic Development MEC Mxolisi Dukwana. Who is on the stand today ? Doom and gloom! Not Watson Mxolisi Dukwana Watson? OR Tambo international airport are we live? or my network is doing things? lets adjourn the sitting to respect Watson 
2:05,12:36, ADJOURN FOR A MEGA THIEF?????? Confidence is high Yesss nice volume thanks SABC üëå mrng all evidence continue did Watson really die? "Yes Just joined @Zama Kubheka something is fishy about the whole death 
12:42,16:04, Wow. ..this is forensic @carnoth ngomane I thought i was the only one everything about Gavin Watson death is odd. I might even doubt that it is his body. If any body. @Zama Kubheka you not Even when they showed his brother on the news...he was all smiles am I a bad person for not feeling any condolence for Watson and his family? that was also odd for me i think South African government is playing with money to promote this commission because nothing will come out of this particular procedure not bad but unsimpathetic 
16:25,17:51, GARAHM things will come out of this commission Our African Culture teaches us to respect the dead immaterial of their past. My condolences to His Family. did anyone see the body? I mean that guy does have enough money to disappear Bunch of lawyers today...whatsup? not that I know about "Wow üòÉ I was just about to say the same thing Ace!!!! 
18:07,20:44, @Thulani Bukani and enough money to fake his death Well represented.. master of the understatement ! they making money Exactly @carnoth ngomane i have never seen a lot of attoneys like this üèÉ @siphelo ngunze Why concluding nothing will come up when we already heard so many mind boggling facts we never heard before & now know that NPA & PP are working on all of what is been said here??? "@Pastor J I agree üòÄüòÄin one sitting @Thulani Bukani another brett kable is at play here 
20:56,25:22, @Cerebis I accept and respect your views. NPA should make sure of the Watson case A lot at stake here the subtitles are highly misleading npa is dying Shama the Guptas man @Peter Goosen SAPS should put their best detective on the investigation. Could be another Brett Kebble. "morning everyone if best detectives still exist @Anne? 
25:43,28:53, Watson's death i think lot of official who are implicated will commit suicide.... the lawyers are killing it hey indeed lawyers will have a great xmas later this year Watson is laughing from where ever he isü§î were. is ace "yah question will always be where do the clients get there money from? Ace is coming @Marugasen Ganesh. His day is coming 
30:11,34:08, U expose corruption then u vanish Watson is answering for his crimes where ever he is.... he was found with R70... no luggage... no cell phone.. and the seat belt behind his back.... suicide seems possible I like this law "@Robert Russell a business man travelling without his cell phone he killed himself. qyuuuuu Mandla Msimanga ‚ÄãCyril smuggled Watson out of the country covering up his corruption . Do you have proof? Please report it to the police. Not doing so makes you complicit. "@carnoth ngomane What about the possibility that someone  @Michael Michael i doubt that. im sure he got sum1 to take a fall 
34:15,36:40, airpot record will assist if he is stil alive wat if he flew n fodge death "@Abe Molefe with money buy No passport was found in his position? "@Pastor J thats another angel to look at it Does Duduzane Zuma is a businessman if so what kind of his businesses if exists? Does still operating? Zama remember wt Hansie Cronjie and Brett Cable did.thats wat axectly Watson did. "Some people are imagining things Watson is laughing at y‚Äôall incl the Chair of this commission right now 
37:05,39:32, Z@Sindiswa Moolman lol True They got rid of him. period. This is like all the action conspiracy movies i've seen. Anyone feel like they are watching a movie here? Mandla Msimanga So YOU HAVE PROOF?!!! @Robert Russell Thats sad my brother. But the reality is what it is. A land of so many thieves with no respect for the dead and the dying Watson is instructed to take his own life or......... To fist story .They did not want to open the door for the media but opened the door for the ANC members fishy we are waiting for dukwana whats so long Mr mxolisi Dukwana will spoil beans 
39:49,41:39, Lorraine nothing wrong with that @Zaahier....something tells me uba the guy was instructed. Correspondence first @ Abe Molefe Watson ran away or he was murdered. It wasn't a accident nor was it suicide. Yes dear "So u think uhave seen it all in the movies "I have a feeling that there was another vehicle invovled Mandla Msimanga ‚Äã maybe. The best way is to lodge a complain with the Public Protecter and i know a lot will be revealed.. Are you going to do this? I agree that car was to damaged for that accident 
41:44,44:10, @JERRY MALAHLELA like for real. There are no cameras but here we are today Watson was driving cars for more than 50 years but just yesterday he forgot how to drive a car. he only drove automatic They are no cameras where the accident happened. toooooo convenient. This is beyond an inside job. cameras are there but controlled The TAX man in the USA got gangster Al Capone into jail.... I think that SARS would also have enough evidence to have Watson incarcerated for TAX fraud... A rich man drive a car like that ha ha ha lamborgin to toyoya corolla a millionare? never That's how I feel like this is a movie with a script. 
44:12,47:07, "With Collins The car was already damaged the day before. They then went and dropped the car off and scattered car parts all over. The issue of Watson is very clear like all the ANC killings happening in Kwazulu natal n Limpopo "They claim that his car went for a service @Eugene Fourie I wouldn't be surprised hey. Who killed him.? The ANC KNOWS SOMETHING This morning they allegedly made a statement saying they request investigation 2 be made by their private investigator not police michael hm 
47:19,48:22, ANC for u. michael that is ANC Makes agree "@Mandla Msimanga I feel it is possible that he staged his death yesterday adv thembeka tweeted he is off to Bali passing of human being even if its your enemy its not easily digestible lm very hurt what ever is behind hi some of the evidence is now null and avoid i thnk within the tweet ( though) jokingly there is a truth The ANC might have to pay back R40m of donations that they received from BOSASA since 2007 and if that is the case then that's the end of the corrupt ANC The private investigators are only making sure that all other evidence is destroyed. 
48:29,49:51, Watson knows to much and theirs no money to give to people hes time is up so get rid of him....looking for a new player DO we really need a holms to find out what happened to watson? Robert do u think they have that money?? Thinking how Watson contributed to the struggle against apartheid; it is painful "Mandla AGRZZI yesterday also said Watson ws planning to leave this country lol we are really led by thugs here old thugs üòÉ üòÉ @Max Muskat xD 
50:11,52:09, WE are ourselves to be blamed why keep on voting for ANC agrizze might be next kabelo that guy he was working with him papa leshabane now hr is a spokes person of the family Watson death very strange... the driver hit a left hand side pillar on the right hand side ???? No damage to left hand side of vehicle. @Zaahier Adonis True story!! Zaahier he dd get death treats already bt i dnt knw how he is surviving Many people are finding it difficult to accept the version of Watson accidental death; reasonably so Nope they are already on the brink of bankruptcy.... they can't even pay for their website management.... the ANC needs to have ACE come up with a plan to loot more for their coffers @Michael Michael the only media house to report is eNCA 
52:10,54:31, we didn't even see blood at the scene Did anyone see accident right after it happened. who is investigating the accident? what about the drones üò•üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ "Thats why i ws saying this Commission is a joke Michael Jackson attended his own funeral from the gallery One of the JMPD officers had blood on his gloves Lots of people wanted him dead. @Thando Nkutha Thjere are pictures and news video footage of the body in the car and being removed. It cannot be released out of respect for the family. It has been reported as such 
54:34,55:57, wie se brood is Watson se dood SABC PLEASE FOCUS YOUR CAMERAS Next is Angelo Aggrizzi nobody wanted Watson Dead!!!! he made Officials RICH! they protected him and moved him away(ANC) Don‚Äôt be snitch This movies is just starting. @Paster J send me a link to the videos pls @Bronx Wavy unless he was planning on turning against them @Thando Nkutha From his McDonald's burger? 
56:19,57:57, I‚Äôm hungry "Guys why SABC with all of the Public money spent there eNCA confirmed footage and the body being that of Mr Watson but will not broadcast it out of respect. HOW CAN CRIMINALS put up commision to investigate them n arrest them he has no reason to. even Agrizzi agrizzied to be the fall guy its very strange.normarly after an accident the medea wud show a body coverd this time its just a car nd th wud be witness tlng how th car lost control I smell rat here @Watson those videos must be somewhere on the internet than eNCA is part of corrupt media house 
57:58,59:50, forensic take ages to remove the body why seconds today? Did he respect us while capturing our state Bronx that's a lie even at Marikana it was wrong for the media to show dead bodies like that The Watson accident reminds me a lot of the Diana accident....???? Sadly when someone dies the negative comments can never hurt or insult the dead but those comments cause immense pain and suffering to the living relatives. Thami exactly This is deep. and unfortunately the beginning. they show Marikana shooting every year!!! 
1:00:15,1:01:32, Bronx I'm saying it's wrong @Thami Nobela exactly what i thought sound like a bloody agent it's wrond to show dead bodies respect for a man who gave away your money lol Zuma games Is this guy Ace's lawyer?? They mentioned Bloemfontein? during 911 the American media never showed dead bodies This advocates is delaying proceedings now 
1:01:32,1:02:47, "They shouldn't tell us about nt showing his body 2 respect the family @Bronx Wavy I dont know anyone who wants to see a dead body who is this guy representing? it's only here in africa Tell us who your client is Sir we want to see Watson body as proof. his remains are not sacred @Tebogo Makoro They won't say in public who he represents. They told the DCJ in chambers. "@Tebogo Makoro the last time i checked @Bronx Wavy me too 
1:03:21,1:06:42, @Tebogo Makoro i believe he represents the Gangster of Luthuli @Anne M. and @Vuyisile Ngesi Thank you! this lawyer is condescending "They will leave this country 1 by 1 AFRICAN JOKE his in Zuma's bunker under Nkandla with Ghaddafi's Millions y show black bodies always? "Zondow is very weak and anytime he is confront he gives up and collapse Mr Zondo this is not a Comedy Show üôÇ 
1:06:59,1:08:38, @Salmaan Abrahams iagree @Ibo Thabo remember he has to be fair and impartial he speaks in dual tongue and is snide in his remarks not to mention his condescending tone Gavin Watson cudnt drive a manual only a automatic be he rented out a manual. this is a waist of data @Salmaan Abrahams I agree - his tone is very condescending. R70 in the pocket after all the millions? my morning prayer is done Would you feel the same if he was black... or is this the racist victim card you are playing 
1:08:52,1:11:05, its not time for the others yet now sit down! @carnoth ngomane yes he have to be fair but clearly he is being bullied by Sikhakhane and this white guy now "im not big on feelings  "Simple. He will just refer to him as ""Mr Helens'"" client like they're doing.üòÇüòÇ" "extended tea break Ohh Please...... Yes Robert ...is that you asking from your seat of privilege? "@Ibo Thabo yes it looks that way 
1:11:17,1:12:37, watsons lawyer deserves an oscar Extended tea breakes is focking with taxpayers money and we dont have enough money to play with why these people want to be treated differently #RIPGavinWatson "i steal your car  THE CLIENT IS ACE MAGASHULE sorry for shouting This dude is like Barry Roux we've been describing Watsom as a business man and corrupt. nobody spoke of his colour but you. So who is racist? 
1:12:55,1:14:48, Mr Helens talks without being invite and CJ allowed him lol mr lebala Hayi Mr Lebala Crack the whip DCJ.... ZOndo and his adjournments ... Why does he keep looking at his watch yet he never keeps time??üòÇüòÇ Zondo starting at 12 üôÑ hahaha what did i jst say?? 
1:14:55,1:15:52, mxm more delays üòÇ time management guys lol Emails no planning This commission is a mess shut this fool up please This is better then a Soap Opera 
1:15:59,1:16:50, he thinks he is here to teach law Arrogant lawyers are running the show here Your must come later to respond after this evidence tell them mlungu Oh my goodness sit down already This Helen guy is bulling poor Zondow I sometimes think we're off topic in the inqury Lawyers like to use technicalities to delay things HELEN IS A BULLY 
1:17:03,1:18:51, commission +commission +commission. a truck full of money spent with thiefs. Our tax money Thanks @Tebogo Makoro. I have the same suspicion as to who this anonymous client is Helen for HelenaüòÄüòÄüòÄ why they are adjed theyre hungry Adc Helen is throwing a hissy fit....pure dramatics! did the circus take a break You are right @Zama Kubheka "'Scraping together funds for legal fees"" tells is who Hellens' client is" 
1:18:52,1:27:04, let me also go for tea make ups louw its not zuma "@ Thando Nkutha there is more evidence which implicate Helens clients guys take a break "Without any disrespect to the Chair of the Commision we are adjourned Judge Zonda you must discipline this arrogant so and so. He is beginning to intimidate proceedings "the state capture was 1year old a few days dindnt thes guys adjourned early and they have mos a lekke party 
1:28:49,1:47:56, Yes pal lol when does this bozos start i got a meeting with Johan rupert Politicians are breathing a sigh of relief after news of Gavin Watsons suspicious demise. R.I.P Weeks of evidence. Saved commision a lot of $ but cost country as the corruption will continue unabated. so true Gee Peex @Gee Peex1 He might have been a South African but he definitely wasn't a patriot. "Zondo yes koos @Gee Peex1 You'd have to have rocks in your head to think he is not guilty of massive corruption. 
1:50:33,2:00:01, @Gee Peex1 There was enough evidence and corroborating evidence implicating Watson. He took his own life and staged it as an accident. @Gee Peex1 You seem very protective of the criminals. Are you a tenderpreneur? Otherwise you must be ANC. "@Gee Peex1 Like I said before give the Guptas an applause they are out of the county and they cant be touched... they beat everyone including the Watson Who does Mr Helens represent? what happened guys we back to go home 14h00 @Gee Peex1 what do you think of the videos of Warson in his safe handling stacks of millions of rands shown in Agrizzi testimony....do you think it as fake? 
2:00:13,2:02:46, *Watson Here we go with weak Zondow "@Gee Peex1 And yet you think none of the evidence so far implicates Gavin Watson and because he will no longer testify One day and someday the truth shall be revealed. time to turn against zondo Agrezzis time will come ZONDO is irritating me now with this skit gloves approach @Gee Peex1 the commission videos are here on YT...go ans check and tell me what you see "Agrizzi was a nothing. Watson made him a millionaire 
2:03:00,2:05:28, "@Gee Peex1 In my mind That video clearly shoes Gavin Watson handling stacks of cash in transparent bags...I dunno but why would a prominent businessman deal in cash like that???Cash leaves no trail.... Who is Mr Helens representing here? he is representing voldemalt *shows "Go check for yourself that is why his name may not be mentioned He'll turn state witness and be given a reprieve (Angelo) Mr Helen's client is Voldemort 
2:05:34,2:08:28, PM = P---- Marie This advocate has just shown the 'Gangster State' book. Dissapointed in Zondo really I am PM really mxm @Salmaan Abrahams thank you. waste of time today mr X @Josias Maluleke No-one knows - Hellens is keeping it secret. working with John Doe's here now... 
2:08:31,2:11:19, "a few other videos of Watson with Zuma and also another where he insults his staff.He went to Nkandla who is this Mr X guys? mr x is mr X ace "Zondow is opening a Pandora box which now everyone will come and say I don‚Äôt want my name to be mention here or there I wonder who is this person that turned the commission into a debate So Ace is X?üò≠üò≥üòÇ "What is wrong here 
2:11:35,2:15:32, mr X is the gangster of parys @Gee Peex1 Why? What do they have to hide? myb mr Helen's is driving ryt now client Ouch that velvet bow tie thoughüòÅ that mr x can come clear his name if did nothing wrong. stop hiding the facts and names. mr x will have his or her chance to give evidence. I think it's Malcolm X @Lourens De Jager been a nailbiting wait for him etcetc not eh wheels start turning like a hamster on a wheel! *now the wheels have started turning 
2:15:37,2:18:55, from 10 till now lawyers exchange with mic agh I saw the Deputy Judge last week - very dignified and warm in person! Surprisingly not tall person though! zonda a farce no this is mos madness someone said watson has died is this true? court time now "the law is the law for everyone. just get on with the business Zondow is very weak @Lourens De Jager üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ 
2:18:58,2:21:21, I really wonder about Zondo‚Äôs judgements at times now not only the name but the subject should not be mentioned """some family members had already confirmed Watson‚Äôs identity at the mortuary in Germiston""" but if you investigate or inquire why would u use abbreviations and keep names secret..investigating is a measure to reveal isn't? this lawyer is so irritating Names coming SOON! Don't worry according to some reports his body was unrecognizable?? could have been a person other than watso that man is a fox he will fake his own death..he uses people to his own accord I maintain he is alive somewhere in the Caymen islands Its clear that a lot of the participants has no clue of how the protocol works !! If you are really of the opinion that Mr Zondo is weak you are truly predigest towards his mandate! 
2:21:25,2:23:41, üòÅüòÅüòÅ boring!! call mr x and ask if his ok if his name is revealed this commission its a play ground "As usual the tea /lunch break  this fella with the bowtie really makes this look like a circus man guys this people are only wanting our time this bottie guy sucksü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Somebody is going to have a slip of their toungue and mention his name. 
2:23:57,2:29:19, Moerse bow tie... "Mr Mike Hellens SC must be a big fish. Based who he has represented before the clowns in the circus also wears a moerse bow tie When's Adv. Kate Hofmeyr coming kasi? "Zondo is so weak  the problem is they are trying to do each as they have been caught with fingers in the cookie jar "Evidence Leaders are generally poor or just inexperienced self-important "I think the audience should all start whispering Ace  
2:29:51,2:35:28, @jasper dougal I beg to differ. Did you see Adv Gcabashe last week and Adv Norman before the break? "It‚Äôs Ace  " The leader of the RET cabal using white lawyers. That should be interesting. The Witnesses previous testimony was all about Gupta brothers and Ace Magashule RET Cabal always use White Advocates üòÜ Clientielle lawyers!! v "@Thando Nkutha My apologies üòÉ Yes 
2:36:42,2:38:16, Bow ties are also something they must ban in South Africa....plz ü•Äü•Äü•Äü•Äü•Äüêõüêõüêõüêõüêõ Mr Hellen‚Äôs interviewed DCJ Zondo when he applied for the job! "This is not a place for bow ties Helens went AWOL??? "Rewatch the Sikhakhane 4Zuma boxing üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ@Cerebis who is mr X please?? @jasper dougal. I wonder if their supporters see that RET is actually a lip service and not something that is in the plans of their leaders. These lawyers are looking like the Colonel from KFC 
2:38:36,2:39:32, mr helen is gone looks like a big moth sitting on his throat @jasper dougal lol lol lol He is trying to look smart. He is not fooling me. i do not want to rewind to find out who is mr x Yeah we all know Mr X is Ace Magashule. Only the likes of him and Zuma can afford Hellens. Let's carry on already "Yes  No man....extended tea....extended lunch....what??? @Thando Nkutha I think it's Ace. 
2:39:32,2:43:06, Skhakhane has opened a gate for all lawyers to do as they please. "Has it never occurred to Zondo  Its Ace or maybe the Guptas? "It‚Äôs Ace Magashule  I don't think it's the Guptas. They've been mentioned by various witnesses in the past. Guptas will be Mr C....for curry I miss Gerrie Nel sometimes..he calls a spade a spade and he is well trained well experienced and factual...he doesn't beat around the bush and use terms such as moemish .... "Go back and check Witness previous testimony  "Cant be Guptas 
2:43:56,2:47:22, @Yin Yang Yep - the ANC is corrupt to the core. The ANC is on trial at this (and other) commissions. Guys who is this Mr X who is holding the Commission to ransom? Zondo‚Äôs solution means that anyone else called can ask for same consideration . No words ! RIP Ben Said Mr X is Mr 10% THIS IS A WAIST OF TAX MONIES who's 10 ania Mr Dukwana is ready spill the beans civil society needs more oversight 
2:47:39,2:49:11, no THuliu did not @Ania Teo hahahaha down zondo down @Gee Peex1 it was C J Mogoeng Thuli said that the CJ shld choose who will be the chair Zondo is getting the moer in now! Gee Peex1 ‚Äã@jasper dougal ....Was it not Thuli that appointed Justice Zondo. No he was nominated by the CJ. Zuma was not allowed to nominate. TIME is running ! get on with it. i heard enough of mr x "he phrased that eloquently "" it is as it was""" 
2:49:37,2:50:53, ha ha yeeees thats the status quo : it is as it was a year ago beautiful language of english reading oaths off cellphones Ace is 10% He's voice "economy in tatters  @Ania Teo Yes - Ace = Mr 10% Exactly 
2:51:01,2:56:49, confident people speak loud this witness is going to irritate us Who is the lawyer leading evidence now? Adv Mokoena @Anne M. Yeah - I think he's great. The best of the evidence leaders. zondo is worse with pages than zuma why are these lawyers so defensive lol. Can't their employers instruct them to apply for cross exam the witness? This issue is now getting ridiculous "Gee Peex1 ‚ÄãYeeeeeeeees.....CJ Mogoeng Mogoeng did appoint him hungry
