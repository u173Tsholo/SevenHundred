2:26:12,2:28:14, @keresemese simon R88000 is too small vs the circles a person has to revolve around once they are said to be engineers of something. Other engineers and other collegues are paid more than 5 times that Why didn't they specify the name of the proposed owner in the resolution @Lee D. Hendrix - hehehe she has answered this at length before DCJ Asked and answered!! @kersemese simon. human nature (greed). always wants more and more. No No No  "@Sal SA  Asked and answered before NO Eishhhh this is painful today

Even so @Heather Durr time for your G&T 🤗 Heather durr..i think the DCJ is asking a pertinent question in this instance ...Legally oriented people are sweethearts as business executives. "@Sal SA Its only a proposal to the Board 
2:30:24,2:32:00, you guys still entertain that Google lawyer. I mean the surname says it all.. Durr!! "I as a lawyer with a BA LLB and 30 years experience accept her answer unequivocally. No magic required A company secretary is mandated to offer legal advice to the board *Not @Sal SA Its a matter of complying with processes rather than contracting Ms D is cornered now ... "@Sal SA You should not be too legalistic what Face value? cos there was no value there "@Brightwell. No sir 
2:32:08,2:34:06, ...A company secretary is the company personified. "@Karel What kind of legal advice-you mean she can draft mergers and acquisitions the way I do as well as make Forex applications "Lock up Zuma RSA needs the R500 Billion so you drafter half a submission? @Sal SA you clutching at straws now. The resolution is reached by the Board having applied their minds. They new what the situation was and gave the managers the authority to act as they did @Brightwell. These are legal issues and have to be very clear. Now we sitting with a problem because people don't think its important/legalistic! hahaha...Heather Durr...a company secretary gives legal advice to the board on different matters and not mergers and acquisitions not could of you SHOULD OF 
2:34:41,2:35:33, Ms Daniels warning of implications isnt second guessing @Sal SA In any case did they raise the question themselves as to why the proposal did not mention who the proposed owner was? you didnt alert them she was the legal person weejy @cliffy my point exactly-cant the execs read English Looks like Advocate Seleka the Chair of the commission today and the DCJ the evidence leader. wow @Ndumie how is he going after Zuma cos this commission was set up by Zuma himself and Madonsela? i am concerned why the chair does not want to accept the answers coming from witness from this point of proposed owners.  
2:35:53,2:37:10, She was Cosec NOT legal "Looks like DCJ did some ""verbal push-ups"" for Suzanne - she's really looking & sounding dodgy today" lol internal control systems are not unplaced . . . how can someone make amendments and you dont question since you the one to submit? lol  sizwe it's because the witness is not being truthful you shouldve made doubly sure at that time Ms Daniels @Martha Sello do you really think the current president had nothing to do with all these things that are happening she in previous sessions said she was part of legal and drafted some papers etc @Diane Louw not could of or should of but could have and should have 🙄 @Cliffy I agree she is dodgy beyond 
2:37:17,2:39:21, ditto teunis "@cliffy Now we know why they were called the Gupta Board @Brightwell.
