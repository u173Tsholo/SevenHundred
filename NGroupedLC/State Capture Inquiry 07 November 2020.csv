SHE CANT BE:A CA !!!! probably bought the degree" @Trevor Arosi Treated DoodOO not the same "Zondo doesn't have to explain this to her She put herself under the bus Marcus Jooste I can go on they should really go into the pyschy of these individuals because they tend to be skelm correct chair She was on a board appointed as a CA "to say i don't does not mean u are are ncompetent just loke dudu myeni kept on saying

5:03:13,5:03:48, malima ur people are not educated "CA SA Zondo is too long winded in his explanations. needs to be more succint and to the point it'd be funny if SAICA came out and said we don't want anything to do with her lol. @Yolo that's correct :goodvibes::goodvibes:Ola zondo I certainly hope someone is got to check the validity of this woman's degree. SHE is bringing the reputational damage to Chartered Accountants by her ignorance of basic terminology 4PM is looming A liar 🤥 and an accountant 
5:03:52,5:04:48, I am rusty it was 30years ago. She is a current CA HE DESCRIBE NONSENSE She accepted the CA salary!! Zondo must learn to accept criticism. very true baba Zondo.....e.g as a school principal you know what a blackboard is "I feel for Mrs Kwinana nope zondo must question @Pholoso Kale its fine to agree with her on some points but dont forger the mountain of other evidence "But I don’t criticise Christians. It’s their belief 
5:04:50,5:05:31, Clive OConnell 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Trolls are working even on Saturdays I see some here on this chat Memela-Mbanjwa.....Kwinana-Mbanjwa...something fishy here u are disaster indeed Yes Kate. No time for Greek words What Zondo says or doesn't say doesn't bring the profession into disrepute @Dan Brown She got it in 1998. May be rusty!🤷🏿‍♂️ Leon..... DCJ is the best!!!!!! MBANJWA IS HEAVELY CONFLICTED IN THIS CASE 
5:05:31,5:05:51, it's a pleasure because you were corrupt MBANJWA IS WEAK CA profession linked to high earnings so generally people who end up there are greedy individuals mostly not all some get in because they really love to interact with figures "That mask mut be a slightly darker green chair Anc ur showing us dat ur all not going to school. how can u point Sam fool on a big position like dis I like Ms Kwinana attitude Dont CAs do Business Law?

5:06:41,5:07:16, Any adult married person should know what she does not know. Where did Mbanjwa get here Lay degree ?

5:08:26,5:08:39, This is sad to note how people who might not be that eloquent with the Queen’s language are mocking Ms Kwinana. She is indeed a qualified CA but was lured into what appears to malpractice at SAA. "am afraid Anoj Singh was SAICA @Johann I would say that most people at senior positions in SOEs are cadre deplyments and ANC members..? Kates domicilium clauses are 1 House 2 Email. 3 whatsapp 4 Parents home 5 dog house 5 Church pastor A CA would be familiar with the latin terminology. I bet every one of these black lawyers know that too. This woman's smile 🤣 I love it!!!!!! "In fact Board members @ALTA en @wim louw I'll be back.

Ms Kwinana said she does not trust the emails hence she delivered hard copies of statements for her Forex clients this one just goes to prove that a degree does not mean you have the apt skills or expertise or experience
