"Zuma and Manyi side by side Zondo is leaning more on Manyi @Kay Kay Zondo is trying to make him feel comfortable in order to catch him. 
58:04,1:02:23, SKELM Guy has got an attitude "this chap seems to consider himself a genius "Anyone who makes him sweat and doesn't get intimidated by him "@Buyani Mhlongo "Adv. Hoffmeyer is in trouble of receiving worse attitude from this guy Morning @He lives in you "very true Khanya This is the only problem I have with Judge Zondo. He must stop leading people. This guy must account and not get led to ways out or giving stories that does not make sense at all. 
1:03:20,1:07:42, " cry the beloved country... """he was my employer after all""hahahahahaah" Hofmeyer is behaving like a bribed journalist who's pushing agenda Eliot Chauke Dont worry Chair knows how to control her points everynow and then Oh No @Eliot Chauke ...Why do you say something like that? @Ewald Kruger Behave Boi.... "I think he wants to say He's a Smooth Criminal 
1:08:09,1:09:50, ANC Terrorists Afrikaner Resistance👍 @Ewald Kruger AGAIN Behave Boi Who are ANC terrorists now?? Selective memory Afrikaans for South Africa MSAGA arrogant neh?🙄 lol 
1:10:22,1:15:47, Soooooo Our Former president lost his right to appeal "Manyi is trying adopt Zuma's style ""I don't recall"" today he is different from the first appearence. that day he was acting clever." Lets move on.. With our incompetent government it is possible to receive salary after being fired. "@Elliot Chauke @Kay Kay Manyi say he was not fired and his proof is that he was receiving salary... The White Lady is saying he was fired but not giving evidence to back her up . Agenda "Eliot Chauke She admits what's the purpose of this commission? Government does pay you your salary after you have rendered your resignation doesn’t stop immediately on the month of termination and Manyi is aware of that 
1:16:24,1:23:02, @khumalo whats there to investigate? she received his bank statement... wat other proof do u need Wow the main reason why this commission was formed? because it seems like like there are no results. Hofmeyer failed. she spent time on irrelevant things. Skip the tea and lunch so you can finish. Eliot Chauke Fair enough Former President Zuma just lost a bid to appeal the Hannekom judgement. @Kruget 🤣🤣🤣🤣 "Zuma will be sick next week 
1:23:13,1:29:13, @Spykerhond Hahahahahahahh. u are so right He was not getting his salary it had to be back paid. "@Elliot Chauke @He lives in you ...Thats a brilliant line. Well said. She spent time on the letter that has no legal basis🤣🤣🤣 Why is he laughing now? Tell us about the Guptaz lol Lies Lies Lies Manyi is not lying. 
1:30:40,1:36:28, Kruger this is becoming a joke lying "like Zuma @Ewald Kruger ...I have just realised that both you and I are trying to make sense and conversing to 2 Royal Idiots and a few Professional fools. Perhaps we should let them go. Manyi is doing very well Loluqine mahhala lo manyi is now playing advocate🤣🤣 the commission is being turned into a tooth less dog. The commission has spent R400million... and still counting. nobody has been brought to book. Manyi cost to the commission is drop in the Ocean 
1:37:06,1:42:15, @He lives in you ...I have also realised that Elliot is not blinded by the condition of his eyes but by the extent of his foolishness @Pastor are you for real?😂 @Spykerhond .Vote for me as the next President and I will drop Vat to 2%. Thats the ki "Stratcom haha He's being sacarcist to indimindate the evidence. total waste of tax money @Spykerhond ...hahahahahaha. I think you know what I meant. But it is the kind of nonsense that Politicians feed voters. Zondo once said he meet with cyril Ramaphosa regularly... Im not surprised why Transformation Champions are always ABUSED when appearing before this commission "the chair wants to lead 
1:42:38,1:51:24, Chair is lost even.. @Boshiolo can u be specific please And indirect answer? Chair has lost his chair he will then loss his shares😀😁😂😂😁😀 "Hofmeyers relationship with Manyi is like cat and mouse Chair is bias today and only protecting Manyi than his evidence leader @Kay Kay Hofmeyer is pushing an Agenda. open your eyes ZONDO IS NEUTRAL "@Elliot Chauke 
1:52:57,1:57:18, @Kay Kay Hofmeyer is busy with the Stratcom led smear campaign on Transformation Champions @Thando Nkutha ...Who bro? I have my Doom in hand Hi "@Pastor hi Indeed because i hve a different view? just like Zuma @Thando Nkutha Tried Spraying the Doom. Not strong enough for some cockroaches unfortunately. Try your broom bro 
1:58:44,2:03:19, @Thando whats your problem u @Eliot Chauke ...Our views and opinions may differ but I like love you my brother. Ewu namanje nisqhubeka boMbhengest 😛 Correct Thando "Hofmeyer is wasting our Tax money. every time she open her mouth lol I'm hearing Gupta voices Eliot Chauke -Are you a journalist. 
2:03:42,2:07:29, "I don't think Hofmeyer should have led him here Jimmy with a slight shiffer in his voice-1st time he said there is no evidence ppl are just speaking of hear say. @Thando hi wena ntsena u nga pfumeleriwa ku commenta? u hluriwa hi yini ku amukela kuri a hi nge vi na mavonelo yo fana? Eliot Chauke how is she wasting the tax money?are you even paying tax? Jimmy is looking nervous now @Mbambeni stop embarrassing yourself @Donovan No Boclever boyafela sorry Jimmy Eliot Chauke you are the one embarrassing yourself 
2:07:45,2:10:58, If you pay tax in India does that count? Angelo Mondlane Uyabanyisa abanye bo-Mr Know it all!! 😂 stop the money flow "@Donovan Peters R400million has been spent I never subscribed but used to get free TNA papers in my postbox he's contradicting himself now Eliot Chauke-They are now shivering like Jimmy. @Eliot Chauke . My brother. The case in point here is simple. A dog only barks at a moving bus. So TNA died because Free State government stopped dishing out money 
2:12:14,2:14:00, @Thando i hve no clue about what? They need to search the bunker in Nkandla where all covert operations are run from to derail S.A. Ms Hofmeyer is giving Manyi his own words to hang himself with TNA went straight from my postbox into the recycle bin. That Nkandla bunker has a lot of secrets!! Even Gaddaffi stash is still in there not in Swaziland 😄 There are Ghosts in Nkandla no-one wants to buy Nkandla 😱 that she's pushing an agenda? manyi is no longer going to cape town now? 
2:14:45,2:17:14, now this is the terrain of manyi..his explanation makes sense MM your role as Media Magnet understanding of circulation print orders and freebies is a joke if you want to waste advertisers money no wonder TNA went south I'd buy Nkandla jus for all those treasures. There target market was certainly targeted at the wrong market.. recycle bin. "Mr Elliot There agenda was put through a shredder and recycled. Sad attitude Mr Joe Khosa you be the judge... "I think we are probing probabilities here 
2:17:55,2:23:56, circulation and Readership is two different aspects No Probibilities here Facts being checked against what was being said. Ms Hoffmeyer is right. I used to get that paper in Telkom but I never read it. I don't know why though. Remember jimmy Manyi harbored interests of being a “media mogul” this subject is very close to his heart 🤣😂😂😂😂🤣 The commission would be able to govern this country after all is wrapped up. Is Mr Manyi still in ATM party leadership? Manyi gives the state its money "Certainties Thamsanqa Nomayela He is sticking to his story right 
2:25:37,2:30:55, Hofmeyer is starting a debate she's not gonna win A very biased NewAge designed to provide its readers with a false narrative that the ANC government is governing so well. hi ! following it !! "Monopolies Hlaudi and Jimmy and JZ Media Giants? Did I miss anything? Have they been tested elsewhere should be the question But this 👦 😂😂😂😂do you dispute this? That's your favorite question 
2:33:07,2:37:21, this advocate is not disturbed at all by Manyi's obvious disdain and sometimes attempts at belittling her. Devoid of developmental agenda dead😂😂😂 Sthakathi Khumalo -The guy that debunked WMC by Bell Pottinger soon to testify.Bell Pottinger apologised to S.A. @Thando Nkutha ...I am not sure what you did to her but she seems very upset today. Reminds me of my last 40 years. That response was personal shame!! 96% dont matter!!!! thats the agenda we talking about Someone needs the loo Government employees miss TNA have they changed the venue? 
2:44:39,2:57:52, we made a mistake when we believed the Guptas where the problem. we took our eye off the while people- the real thieves "tina GUPTAS WERE THE SMALL FRIES HERE!! You are correct @tina ........Now ..now.......the race card again...... I think Zuma interrupted the real state capture which was comfortably going on since the anglo-boer war ended Tina... your thinking is as bad as your writing. @tina ....you brainwashed...girl.... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 @Khumalo. thats the whole truth. Like hoffmeyer said shes not interested in 96% of GCIS spending... but 4%. Compare it to Daily sun then Jimmy 
2:58:01,2:59:54, Tina has a simple mind 🤣🤣😝 Yes Mam. Got him Manyi admit you are cornered on this one Is this Ace???? we are focused on the 4%? who got the 96% please 😂😂 "When a Fool as run out of foolish things to say "Its not even about race 😂😂 
3:00:08,3:01:14, @Pastor J .....spot on..... Zuma didnt loot "Tina is a twit @Eliot Chauke I looting the SOE's Shame Mr. Manyi .....when all else fails drop the race card. The Guptas and their people stole billions ... look at Eskom SARS SAA Prasa Denel etc etc Zuma didnt loot @Eliot Chauke I did the looting 😡😡 
3:01:31,3:02:54, @Pastor J..your remarks should be directed at Tina "Eliot Chauke Lets be honest bro Jimmy lieg you are correct @ Elliot didn't loot he stole... Dont fall for Stratcom agenda on Zuma... Zuma is clean @Born free You are right friend. But I wanted to engage with sensibility so I chose to direct my comments to Mikes response instead. @Eliot Chauke .....Zumatjie never got anything out of it hey.......... Lawyer going to mae Jimmy grow an afro hy is skandelik@ 
3:03:14,3:05:49, "Jimmy lie at a high grade usually Sthakathi Khumalo -The boss tells everybody what to do whether you like it or not.Especially when you are not educated. Funny how people use anger and arrogance as defense mechanism when cornered It's called stupidity MIKE DURBAN-What to you think the bunker at Nkandla was for. jimmy's arrogance is clouding his so called developmental agenda Eliot Chauke -Bell Pottinger already debunked. @Donovan Peters ...Heheh.......more shower water......heheh "i like his arrogance 
3:05:51,3:09:32, "But new age is new "BUT Jimmy is such a comrade he will finally break like ambassador who allowed Gupta landing @Mluleki- he is himself underdeveloped (arrested development). Needs help I love his arrogance while swimming in the fire pool on twitter. Manyi is making life difficult for Hofmeyer A lot So why did the TNA close after he took over? And falling into his own trap......heheh 
3:09:34,3:10:33, Graphics and text and readability. Cooked lies Jimmy going to Mpumalanga from Polokwane and decides to go via North West and Gauteng🙈 he is making life difficult forhimself "like for real i can believe what i hearing But all this rubbish is not helping him. "He's learned from his master - Zuma If only Pravin got the same treatment like Manyi.. just saying!! Manyi lies live 
3:10:36,3:11:27, Eeeeesh........loooooooooong stories ...this fella has... He's justification of TNA is evasive so true @ willie Jamnandas will ne criss examined by Dali Mpofu... He thinks he is smart. GCIS enable of state capture. "Why can’t this guy be like Agrizzi "Elliot Enabler of looting 
3:11:51,3:14:01, someone will be in a corner soon Now he's washing his hands Catch the enablers that enabled State Capture and taxpayers hard earned money. that guy should sing @Mabaso u saw how many times hifmeyer couldnt proceed wth her intended line of questioning? is that in the bronx? Manyi must come back. He is deliberately buying time talking nonsense so that by 14:15 he is released. A newspaper called Koffiehuis....Really!!!!!!! pissuasion is bad 
3:14:24,3:16:51, shifting blame!!!! During Maseko's tenure GCIS was functioning the same way but they refused to facilitate the Gupta foraging. Why did Jimmy allow it koffiehuis is a magazine not newspapaer hi "no Felix i thought RWC victory united the Nation... im shocked to see how Manyi is treated anybody Mr.Manyi RWC will not make state capture go away @Eliot Chauke dont think like that 
3:16:58,3:19:16, @willie maphosa 😂😂😂sorry Huis genoot is the magazine Felix. @Eliot Chauke im shocked to know how tax payers money were used RWC doesnt change that these rats need to get done in "Okay. I have now figured it all out. Elliot is Jimmy Manyi""s sister in disguise." @Eliot Chauke RWC has been won state capture still here You guys are Full of Hate @Eliot Chauke and you ? a desire for justice is righteous 
3:19:17,3:20:15, im for Unity There were no subscribers so 96% of taxpayers money was used in this scam. We need a Government Paper again @david jacobs i like that. He's evasive GCIS what what! while white people own all the land. @Eliot Chauke indeed "@Pastor J Manyi Manyi... bathathe booy!! 
3:20:24,3:21:34, Skhumbuzo Nkosi -Any government paper is PROPAGANDA. @Lungisani Mabaso hahahahahahahaha #tina do whites own ramaphosa's farm? Like that ESKOM turn around paper TNA was a scam to loot taxpayers money Shifting blame. @tina ....and PAID for it.....through Hard Work...ne... manyi qualifies to be a spy musani ukusibhedela la nina 
3:21:50,3:23:21, he is a spy I should be questioning this Jimmy Laaitie. No words will be spoken. I will just sommer klap the truth out of him "I am reminded of Moises Machel if we could forgive and 'forget' about apartheid... why cant we do the same with the so called state capture @Pastor J .... Manyi is a Pastor as well? Felix Muyoba he is a qualified liar. @Donovan Peters which one is not? @Lungisani Mabaso . Never. Mmusi Maimane is. Thank the Lord I retired already if he is. @Lungisani Mabaso yoooh! I wouldn't go to his churc 
3:23:50,3:26:20, @ Elliott Chauke we can't fi Well spoken. He did quite well. "@Felix Yes most of ATM leaders are apostles. @Zukile Mawisa -illusions of grandeur "However @Elliott we cannot forgive someone who thinks he has done nothing wrong @Yolo More . I have asked the question a million times. How does one go about being Apostles and Prophets etc.? I couldnt get an acceptable answer. Mostly no answer "State Capture didnt kill anyone. Apartheid killed many people. For apartheid 
3:26:56,3:28:20, "Pastor J the small fish no one wants to fry but if they sit there and lie fry them like the rats they are @Eliot Chauke which planet you chatting from? @Eliot Chauke .....Man.....your thinking is really warped......think Bud.... very simple to say who gave instruction @Yolo More I believe you may have just given the 1st plausible answer. i feel nothing for any of them i want this lady for DPP @Kapn Krunch Correct 
3:28:21,3:29:34, "Our economy is on the brink of collapse as result of state capture etc. and we will not put up with anybody for that. People are losing jobs manyi will have to rebook his 16:00 flight @Kapn Krunch ....spot on Bud.... Prophets are those who their ears are next to God's mouth Pastor J. @Elliott is there anyone who have asked for forgiveness here? "I think this group of Gupta network were taught to say No Not me "Stop State Capture... you have a Captured President Punish them....big time....and bring back the money... "@Yolo More The question still is how do they become such? What training 
3:29:38,3:30:51, indeed Mike passing the buck "He is busy looking for investors and more debt really but soothing chauke no man Skhumbuzo Nkosi -One that is independent. Jimmy Money should be in jail already no need for a trial @Mabaso nobody asked for forgiveness from the minorities but Mandela said 'we forgive u' "Where is this venue now "@Eliot Chauke State Capture is cruel 
3:31:32,3:32:43, Eliot Chauke -Always going to race to muddy the waters instead of dealing with issues at hand. @Eliot Chauke ....Mandela was a real Man.... DCJ Zondo taking sides and trying to save Jimmy Money from further embarrassment. Shame on him Cyril Ramaphosa is busy with state capture... all those who paid for CR17 are benefitting. y'all are quiet about that... @Elliott that is not going to happen the state had issued fortune of our money to get to the truth "Pastor J @Yolo lol block chauke that will solve the problem Now he is dictating.. dank manyi 
3:32:47,3:35:17, agree @Yolo More . You could and I suspect be spot on. @Mabaso our Grannies were killed by apartheid. money is nothing cant be compaired to life @Eliot Chauke and our children are being killed now @Eliot Chauke our future chauke needs to be blocked by all so he can chat to himself Eliot Chauke -That is private money Zuma stole Public Funds.Old age ppl we be receiving at R3000 rand grants by now if not for corruption. CR17 funders are getting government and Soe deals.... the cr17 was private however benefits come from government coffers Once Ramaphosa became President Manyi smelt unemployment thatswhy he ran away to ATM to withdraw money from congregants. 
3:35:19,3:37:55, """Generally how we do things here."" Sounds familiar to most companies. We all have something to say. Yet Manyi is running away from the topic or questions Eish These are the people who have worsened the unemployment situation that we're in right now and some of them are not even educated to be in positions they are in and yet we're unemployed with qualificat Manyi is Leadership State capture is Treason. Apartheid is crime against humanity... State capture is not😂 @Zukile Mawisa ...Sadly you are so right my child. I pray that things will change for you soon. Manyi is not a leadership of anything but state capture enabler of note 
3:37:57,3:39:30, Eliot Chauke -Our parents should be receiving R3000 pension payouts and yet you stand up for Askari's. Manyi is fumbling as usual. @Eliot Chauke ...shame Bud......you have been brainwashed.......eeeeesh.. Hofmeyer is getting exasperated by talking to a wall Can Manyi answer question? @Donovan my Granny should have been alive if it wasnt for Apartheid murderers yet you support Apartheid Nice response Manyi "State Capture is treason A Jimmy Manyi ke lemenemene?🤔 
3:39:44,3:40:56, "For persons whom know Theoretical Frameworks Jimmy is very arrogant. mani is a deep skelm Eliot Chauke -PPL still drinking with animals from rivers in this day age is a crime against humanity. he is a serious crook Unenkani Manyi but maybe sometimes one needs to have nkani to defend what you believe may be right. Act of desperation Nothing for being Arrogant He said he is on a hurry now he is wasting time. 
3:41:17,3:42:25, Nothing wrong for being Arrogant "@Elliot Hofmeyer failed. could not finish hahahah Shame.....this Elloit fella has chips on both shoulders.....shame.. Don't fool yourself with the unfounded apartheid nostalgia you seem to be experiencing. watch Jim my run Going to OR Thambo Manyi.....careful of the Bossasa Bridge nearby "Thami Nobela ​Nothing wrong for being Arrogant  "Someone rubbed someone
