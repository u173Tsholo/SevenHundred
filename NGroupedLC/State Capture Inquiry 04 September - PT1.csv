time,15:20,message ... SABC why you late when we about to hear abt your corruption ü§î have we started yet? send them all corruption people to jail This is taking forever.. I am going to watch The Ndlovu Youth Choir on America's got Talent.. they are amazing and in the Finals. foreigners refuse to leave our land so what do you say? After more than 12 months you would expect them to have achieved some consistency in document numbering and presentation such as font size etc. I say if foreigners can start small businesses.. why can't black South Africans do the same or is it because they are too lazy? 
16:18,25:41, @Yin Yang thank you for been so aware. "BORN FREE all foreigners dont start businesses Have you ever noticed the difference in service between foreign Africans and African South Africans. There is an enormous difference in their attitude. It's an excuse to loot driven on by that mad hatter.. Malema and BLF üíîüíî they dont pay tax and sell expired goods that is crooked acumen The LOCALS want everything for nothing that's why they loot and steal and are a problem that must be dealt with quickly. Not all of them 
26:36,29:34, No-one is forced to buy drugs or expired goods. zondo backing off But the sad thing is that the looting of shops affects not only foreigners but also the local South African who will lose their jobs as a result. The standard of living for all is affected sadly. If you are a foreigner in South Africa and you are not happy with anything. How about you go back to where you are from! nobody is forcing you all to stay The looters must take out their frustration on the government and leave the foreigners alone Zondo ü§î "@Henry Muyambu xenophobia is the brother of racism loot the government 
30:13,33:20, It's the Locals that have the problem. Shame on you all South Africans. @adrian albertyn Too late....the ANC has already done that!ü§îü§îü§îüòéüòé @Jack Sparrow I agree with you. Objectively we should all condemn xenophobia the way we condemn racism. Target the ANC government for they should be held accountable for everything that has gone wrong. The Anc Gov never bothered to get foreigners documented since the dawn of our democracy and it is coming back to bite them Then target Government buildings. "Pieter willem Botha Thanks 
33:29,36:25, Xenophobia is criminal and barbaric. This act of looting can turn to be a serious curse on South African land @Born free That you as a taxpayer pay for? zondo showing true colours Go debate in closed room what is this now? Zondo captured "ms Norman "Nigerians are mad Let us go and loot Luthuli House. Anc made all kinds of problems for our lovely country 
36:40,40:32, What is the DCJ doing now? This whole argument is stupid and destroying the commission's reputation??? Malema is behind the attacks on foreigners. If Nigerian are doing that they are equally wrong to target innocent business organisations in their country. but I understand Zondo's point "with regards to the foreign nationals That is why the DCJ has a chamber...go there for that type of discussion? Wonder what got under DCJ's skin. I'm sure someone has been agitating and he needed to clear up his authority. He has to be sworn in and take the oath. Xenophobia is a serious sickness entrenched by apartheid regime. I can't believe that black on black violence is still rife in 2019 ANC failed the people 
41:15,45:35, "The situation in South Africa  "They should have addressed all of this in Zondo‚Äôs chambers  "We are all Africans. People try to make it in life by coming to RSA. If they follow the law of the land Sadly the mentality of violence and stealing will continue even in the absence of foreigners. Foreigners are currently an excuse for these violent tendencies.Lets not be fooled. Very sad situation "@Henry Mayambu I agree They left because they had fake resumes Xenophobia is a CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY fellow South Africans! @Pastor J üôèüôèüôèüëèüëèüëè Agree...Sad Xenophobia has always existed and especially Tribal and Religion. 
46:12,49:17, You could be right üëâ f what is the difference between xenophobia and apartheid @king Fazan Ajo Your chat is going somewhere that is unpleasant and uneccassary and sometimes painful "INNOCENT foreigners are suffering because of their fellow brothers who are busy filling our streets with DRUGS "In line with @Pastor J 's view why are you killing our people in Zambia.. we also will chase your companies and your people by force. "Aparheid had nothing to do with religion and religious differences but Xenophobia pertains to religious xenophobia "it not xenophobia 
49:42,52:36, if South African people continue all this senseless things we Nigeria must involve boko.haram to go to South africa and declare a war in South Africa why foreigners do not return to their countries because they are no longer needed in SOUTH AFRICA PLZ ANSWER ME GUYS Locals are also druglords "@Pastor J just check this out "kAMALANDO i never saw any foreigners who claims to be innocent went to police and open a case against fellow Nigerians and say he or they are selling drugs.. "lets get over the narrative that south Africans are lazy or incapable to run the country Like the Democrats in America.. Same story "this strike is about looting 
52:37,54:58, @king Fazan Ajo The point is that PW Botha was not neccassarily an intelligent man vs. being an oppressor. Any statement that blacks are unintelligent and not capable cannot be regarded as the truth. KING FAZAN AJO WHY YOU GUYS DONT RETURN TO YOUR COUNTRY BECAUSE WE ARE ALSO OVERCROUDED HERE Yes and just look at the Congo "South Africa Africa is xenophobic to black people religious or otherwise. "and that is not racism "Sudan you are wrong because we thought people from south africa are our brothers not knowing we were fools to believe so..now that we have seen your South africa virus we will make sure we cure our country "@Born free 
55:14,58:47, "@Pastor J we cant run away from the truth What is the difference between Racism and Xenophobicism? The southafricans you don't know what you doing Why hating your fellow Africans? This is becoming too much now It's nothing new. @king Fazan Ajo Lets not ignore the remnants of Colonization and this is not a black or african phenomon. Lets reflect on India and Pakistan amongst other colonized regions out of Africa. come to learn holy Quran you guys don't want to understand that South Africa is now carrying the burden of all African countries. We also need to fix our house Pastor J. Stop blaming colonization . Xenophobia has always existed since the beginning of mankind. 
59:19,1:01:02, "@samuel nkone you can see that am hving a meaningful chat with @Pastor J  Chair doesn't need his classes It's xinobia bt he want to looting things without working this people too much lazy black SAns just hate their colour Tribalism is the old term for xenophobia. When Tribes wiped out other tribes. DISS AND DAD YES IF THE ATTACKED THEY MUS RE TURN IN SOUTH AFRICA.FOREIGNERS MUST GO BACK Africa belongs to all Africans. There must be a free movement within our borders but everyone who comes to another country must be well documented What South African nationals should bear in mind is that things can change. The vibrant economy RSA has today might be the preserve of another country in the region. South African will also need help why you not attach white people if you don't want foreign 
1:01:09,1:02:54, don't you think this is getting out of hands? people are fighting because of these boarder gates and as for us blacks we're laughing stock to those who created those borders why are they not attacking chinese This evidence leader is not prepared. @Born free I think you missed the point. Colonization is not being blamed but the lasting impact of it cannot be ignored. Pakistan and India are still reeling from the impact 72yrs later. You can't attach white people who were born in South Africa. That's pathetic Please take this conversations somewhere else and focus on the state capture enquiry CHINESE ARE NOT SELLING DRUGS @Vin Rux so why attack all africans why not go for the ones selling drugs 
1:02:58,1:06:59, "Tribalism please bring Ms Hofmeyr back as evidence leader "Jacqui "@king Fazan Ajo Just 2 words. ""Domination"" and ""Control""" Anyway enough said. Lets focus but why "Most countries in the Wold has at one stage been colonized....UK "Jonathan u cn invite u boko haram A new Zambia is being born so South Africans pray for your children and watch wisely how the Devil using u will turn against your families. 
1:07:06,1:09:43, "That what confuses me. Anytime when they are saying that they don't want foreigners "@Pastor J i think is disunity "Malema is always right she's not prepared at allüò¢ @king Fazan Ajo Agreed "The people that they are not chasing away our government is failing us seriously. no problem of foreigners coming to south africa but mannerly and controlled way. each and every house got its own rules "This evidence leader though watch unza tv on facebook and see how the future of Zambia are reacting. 
1:09:51,1:11:57, 85% of companies here in South Africa are owned by White people coming all over from the European country so please South African do us a favour to go fight them as well and see what's gonna happen "@Cerebis and i think this has being our major set back my friend south Africa may become poorest country in( Africa) 4 its behavior South African concerns are genuine but foreigners don't want to understand coz they feel entitled what geniune concerns they must just leave Ghana is making alot of progress its turning its economy around. @king Fazan Ajo exactly its the same as a 50 old saying he is an orphan South African government is the only one to blame here. ANC is too reactionary 
1:12:35,1:14:05, they are afraid white SA kills kkkk The violent attacks are wrong though however can you guys however hear us that we want to fix our house and we will regroup when we are ok "pule tsotetsi  "@Diss & Dad yeah thats so true sorry pulse but u are being stupid here u can't think most South African u are complaining don't even have a matrics how do want to be employed is this guy telling us what SABC was paying him? The United Nations is watching this country and the government. "As for me so sad to see the black killing the same black 
1:14:06,1:16:22, @Thulani Bukani no it's what they paid people whose contracts they terminated early üëéüëéüëé thanks @Ramkat Julius Malema is No no no. he's never going to Union Buildings that one "South African should learn to work Julius Malema is a circus and knows nothing about governance. "Julius Malema is populist black SAns protest cause they want to loot what their fellows got through their sweat its just jealosy There is no real xenophobia in S.A It's become an excuse for lazy useless people to steal in gang like organized numbers. They will destroy a persons business for a loaf of bread and a tin of sardines 
1:16:27,1:25:07, i don't think s africans will be happy to see foreign peacekeepers in our country if this type of thing gets much worse Stop the Xenophobic attack's on black brother and sisters. Follow your family history and you will find that your great grandfather is from Zambia What if other countries do this things to other south African who are far away from south Africa? "@Yin Yang it has become an African thing True.. Paul Guys lets start our own political party The only problem with us as South Africans is that we start with white clothes when we're doing our laundries and wash black clothes when the water is dirty @Yin Yang so you agree with those who said the black race is actually not complete humans? because according to what you saying we were born with this self hate. immigrants as immigrant should respect and honor the locals. They have to give thanks to the Lord. He can make possible all that is impossible. He can give them grace. The have to love their neighbor. 
1:26:08,1:28:59, @Asmareh Aklogh I totally agree with your sentiments My skin is black so i consider myself an African. ‚Äãimmigrants as immigrant should respect and honor the locals. They have to give thanks to the Lord. He can make possible all that is impossible. He can give them grace. I was so sad when I heard from my sister that her friend who got a job in China was searched at the airport in China as if she is a criminal.. She was even asked to take off her clothes. üòêüòê Going back home for foreigners is the only solution. üò† the sad thing its only a poor person talking of immigrants and borders It means just that @I Am Free then what happened brother? how come we cant govern just 1.1billion people with 54 heads of states? and china can govern 1.4billion people with 1 head of state? some said it not religion ‚ÄãImmigrants as immigrant should respect and honor the locals. They have to give thanks to the Lord. He can make possible all that is impossible. He can give them grace to win spirit of hatred. 
1:29:29,1:33:29, The drugs and expired food are the MAIN PROBLEM Free to sell drugs?

1:55:28,1:57:13, the poor are still poor. sies man they go for easy targets "why blamed foreigners "When they sign the agreement they know that how much money is coming as a share to their home. Everyone who approved the agreement They are wonga street thugs that started the attacks and looting. The police must use REAL bullets. if police they were doing their job this thing would have never went this far if they attack europeans and indians rand will fall forever police is not motivated for crime prevention boko. haram must be involve for all this senseless things of South Africa

2:01:23,2:08:01, i The problem in Africa is the government. Absolutely no reason for any African to move away from their country because Africa is blessed. @Perter Nigeria Killing anyone or just the thought is a sin. You may be angry but 2 wrongs will not make a right. Be patient and allow the authorities to do their jobs. Corruption is a big thing in Africa.

Are you justifying the killing? is Sad if you are. The police is there let them do their job. xenophobia is no different from racism 
2:08:25,2:12:41, We needed a TRC that was to deal with a criminalised population. Noone can walk into your home and mess up if you yourself do not allow them. We allowed criminality to take root.
