I see her as a naive uneducated woman who tried her best to start a business. These vultures saw her coming and preyed on her naivety üò≠ sorry say that again. buai She was part of of the conspiracy to defraud SAX and enjoy the dividends for doing nothing. nope...she got 500000..for what..she was revelling in this freebees She was the owner and had rights to block any movements in and out for the bank account. and she could have reported this when it seemed it was not what she was planning on doing. She approached them "yoh 
27:07,29:56, "typical of young startup companies who until she realized that partners shortchanged her in the loot..not naive..she was part of the looters. ha ha the inflow of money and no goods to show what the outgoing money was been used for.

ANC mentioned again! everyone that gets into govt.in senior levels go with intention of looting..they not there on merit is she a member of ANCWL any connections there 
29:57,33:55, She was aware according to her evidence of wrong doing in July 2015 a month after the money went into her account?? and she does nothing??? Why not consult a lawyer or accountant instead of a spiritual father.She was so complaisant although she saw the signs of fronting early in the business. ANC again she was part of looters..finish and klaar Is she testifying voluntarily or was she supeoned?? no she snitching so she was scared the ANC would kill her? Is that the way the ANC operates? she not innocent ... yes

The Judge is conscious of this. acting for an Oscar..... Is this lady for real üòÇüòÇ 
57:26,59:23, theres a saying in south africa...it is not a crime to steal..but a sin to get caught.. She's a bird of the same further very much so..... she is not so clueless.... this happens in government tender . if you want business they ask money yoh this is bad Its her company. 15 Million and some odd and she did not take even `million. So who really owned this company. ANC????? dont think he is afrikaner This woman is hanging herself The plot thickens 
1:00:11,1:02:03, Mr van Wyk is an African guy Van Wyk is a black man judge a bit slow on the take ..wat part he doesnt understand..cut and dried case why worry about skin color...... crime is crime have no color ya crime has no colour Absolutely on point PASTOR I am so interested to know whar is Mr Van Wyk and his sidekicks are going to say. Many people goes into business knowing nothing about business 
1:02:21,1:05:20, yip and they get tender Yesterday someone called Lex Luger attacked me on this thread about my comment on Van Wyks corrupt activities I was just trying to help no malice or offence guys nothing to understand..rogue It appears van Wyk was the enabler for the ANC "As it turns out All she had to do was obtain the Invoices from the contracting companies she was playing along...... but mgwenya was the best witness abd van wkj is in trouble 
1:05:23,1:08:44, is today not wknd? appointed investigators...eish played dumb and ignorant..now getting smart not an afrikaner "As I mentioned yesterday why can the commission goes to that company that received money if they did the work "Forensics hmmmm hot seats hmmmmm "SA Express was grounded there is so much of fires...last 25 years ...big fires ..small fires..police dont have resources to catch and prosecute 
1:08:50,1:12:18, not that it matters what he is. but his full name is Brian Tebogo Van Wyk The commission will call these people to the enquiry and any paper evidence must be submitted. All is well thanks @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ but we are expecting temperatures of up to 40C also police are corrupt spur buddies "People This evidence leader always had a hostile way of questioning throughout the commission It appears that she did do something to gather evidence to show wrong doing. Maybe we should not judge her until all the evidence is presented including the recordings of conversations. govt is run majority ..so looters will be part of majority. 
1:13:04,1:16:25, "Van Wyk opend the Standard Bank account and controlled it Van Wyks partner was also involved in wrongdoing "@Kirk gemmell ag stop now this color stuff @waterboer Yes PASTOR. That's the burning question. Yes and whether she has paid tax on these dividends. The majority are the looters. eish get real...stop looking with blinkers...its not a rascist thing. There is an article called 'A masterclass in looting' implicating Van Wyk in state capture 
1:17:04,1:19:59, truth hurts isnt "@Thando Nkutha this lady seems she knows what was going on Do these ppl have no conscience? no no thief has a conscience "Africans keep talking about it more and more "Africa only has Africa to back it up *rands 
1:20:06,1:23:58, "This witness is complete puzzle..she leaves more questions... Is she part of the scheme "We are all born here beleve her and you will believe anything "I dont think that anyone can consistently appear to be stupid "yep she is puzzle ja neh "Anyone who listened yesterday will know what I mean "I love you South Africa "@Dabble Smith the racism is off the charts 
1:25:41,1:28:09, "@ Thando We need to work together. Spiritual what? Must be her pastor "The leftists and populist are globally the ones behind this racism phenomenon that a proven fact  I back the commission. what about the COMMISSION since when business seek spiritual advisers I wonder how this women was appointed she seems to know nothing about business this commission is doing an outstanding job you can see that she's committed to this 
1:28:10,1:30:06, "plus the fake news The chairman he is a boss ‚ù§ i think the chairman is bit SLOW "he listens to everything "It's a delicate topic @donovan daniels Are you being sarcastic or do you genuinely believe Judge Zondo is a bit slow? "this is after she went to the bank to have control I think the chair is not fooled and deliberately poses questions that seem innocent.. 
1:30:16,1:32:55, Exactly Donovan I believe he's not slow but ensures there's evidence to back every evidence The Chair has such a deep voice he has to speak slowly Chairman is very attentive don‚Äôt be fooled "Not just attentive but yet his a very considering chair "The DCJ is excellent Wish don't think this recording is going to be of any value @donovan daniels I think the DCJ is one of the most brilliant legal minds in the country. Don't be fooled by his soft spoken or politeness. 
1:33:04,1:37:26, "I agree Magda Eish not audible "They will fix it now "Absolutely they are going to fix it when they come it will boom but brian scored 9 million gor his galfriend is his life partner a lady or a manü§î? man i guess thanks @Anne M 
1:37:45,1:44:09, Brian scored for his gay friend lifetime partner think Mr v wyk is on the toilet by now..... ken that was funny "Why didn't she go to police.. No big question now adays? how do you get a tender asap. be a women in business and of colour too but how can she be so naive not to know whats happening in her own business "she is a crook how the fudge can you meet at spur for a meeting its a family restuarant 
1:45:05,1:53:48, "she is sweating  she neer had a buss......just ontacts She willingly became a conduit for transfers of money and was given payment for it..the R 500 000 It was the pattern among the corrupt gang.. its sad though people need others to instigate corruption on such a level... south adrica is the laughing stock of the world "She agreed Watson Chairman Zondo is absolutely brilliant. The epitome of balance and justice. The Judiciary is the only hope this country has left. 
1:54:18,1:57:54, she knew what she was in for. When she was not receiving what she was promised...decided to become a whistle-blower. at half a million a pop i would also not ask many qeustions The question is.. is she a whistle blower.. did she volunteer to come to the commission or was she supeoned?? Has it been established what she contractually should have received for managing the two airports. "Financial illiteracy has devastated communities her busness was not ground handling it was a laundery like in money laundering and she new from the start and she wanted more but could not get it she blew the bugle or a biiiig whisltle corrupion makes me so antisocial.... to scared to make friends even :( "Ben haha more like a vuvuzela 
1:58:06,1:59:58, lol Party cadres being put in positions they aren‚Äôt qualified for. Out of nowhere the Comrade has access to what he or she thinks is free money. Then she is most definitely a part of of this fraud "Yes millions deposited into her account.... and she wasn't even on site..... no work was done....ü§î.....red flags..... should have contacted her attorneys or crime investigating unit.... no excuses.... we have an hour tea break? this commission and time keeping.. Looks like it .yo think recording gives problems 
2:00:05,2:02:05, All aboard the gravy train that's what it has been. "Reinette Raubenheimer  still watching the recordings With Pres CR speech this gives me hope that some people will be held accountable !!!! ..but it just doesn't make sense tht she would let this Van Vyk character do as pleased with her company if she wasn't IN on it.. why didn't they test the recording before? poor preparation. this tea break though.... they're own technology always gives them problems yet they never learn ..recording should have bn sent fr clean up earlier yazi 
2:02:23,2:05:54, "when someone consults a ""spiritual"" adviser (sangoma) and not a lawyer to record out of a handbag is not ideal.... pick up lots of noice.... "My surname is spelt with a G not a Q "If there aren‚Äôt jail terms after the recommendations of this commission Yesterday she said she decided to whistleblow by threatening to go to a newspaper because she felt she had become a servant in her own company. But her ‚Äúnativity‚Äù is beyond belief. She is acting out to save herself @Born Free I thought so too don't think so @pastorjj "@Pastor JJ 
2:07:52,2:10:09, thanks @margareth waterboer Eish... "This kind of Black business I hate no sound? Is that Van Wyks attorney in the background behind Miss Hoffmeyer?? This witness is always taking notes. Haibo "The corrupt What‚Äôs going on now? "Watson Mustangs 
2:10:10,2:18:19, Going to confuse herself. she has to make notes No sound of the recording Her business money going to ANC wash that money :( She is ANC "hey MD Born Free. We don‚Äôt know what party she belongs to.But does it matter? At least she spilt the beans. she's allowed to do do 
2:19:18,2:25:10, the commission allow anyone to use the language they prefer She did not volunteer she was requested to give evidence. maybe if she can use her language it can be better for her to explain it She has no problem with big English words. Morning Guys..... who is the witness? "Babadi Tlatsana Morning Robert\ Ok got it thanks Anne Hello Robert 
2:25:39,2:28:29, "Oh come on Hi Magda how you doing? haibo @Tholithemba Ntsele I doubt if she knew there was a tender. I doubt if there was a tender. There was a fraud clearly. And how are you doing? There was NO tender and her company got R20m "Magareth Waterboer. Like in a court "looooool...BEE Window dressing at its best aunty Lynn Brown again..... 
2:28:40,2:31:20, I think she didn't know nothing about tenders cos they wanted her CK certificate to get those tenders she is compromised in the beginning and the lie grew as they tend to do and the money she was or not paid was not confusing and she did not refuse it they used the perfect person to use yep can anyone out there give me a tender loving care she was happy that she get money at the end "Who is the """"he"""" they are referring to?" Brian Tebogo Van Wyk BEE against a minority group has killed this country . BEE is not even structured on a merit or qualification basis. "Van Wyk 
2:31:28,2:34:07, Incompetence kills economies.. Or any business.. We should employ the best for the State. Even great business leaders fail This skelm besigheid is so degrading to the rest of us because it merely confirms that you need to be skelm to get these tenders.if you are honest & hard-working forget it This is pure corruption Is the NPA representative listening. this looting is depressing agreed only greased hands will give you any type of tenders Dipou Peters Tenders can corrupt yong ! 
2:34:43,2:36:06, "Can you hear the recording "And to think all the looters and Zuma supporters are still in parliament "I had a look at his LinkedIn profile Tona Kgolo s money . these ministers should lose their pension if they are serious about fixing this @Margareth Waterboer She's listening to the recording through earphones "@Love Moore That is so sad. I've met this kind of a poster girl. Very ruthless Ok. Thx for clarifying that.. @Anne M what punishment will all these people get? 
2:36:15,2:38:11, They must lose their pensions as well as there positions. Tonakgolo "I also checked @Anne M in the private sector in conection with tenders and procurement as a company will have front person to inform you of other competators prices and where you are on the list so reduce or loose my big question is what is going to happen afterwards Living the high life champagne and best restaurants etc @Rox Moleme Tonakgolo = Supra?? and the front person in the office of procurement also wants a cut of the pie very frustrating Morning is the commision not live on 403 or 404?

This testimony is critical. ANC further exposure Sorry for all the questions.... who is she listening to joined late. what is being investigated here? "She recorded a conversation with Van Wyk 
2:40:46,2:42:53, "@Rox Moleme Its a queue of beneficiaries. List is headed by ministers Lynne Brown I cant wait for when Zuma appears in July It's a recording of Van Wyks conversation with her at the Spur. He body language is that of an untrustworthy individual. just shifty. "come zuma's turn we don't need isidingo this is the new daytime wholeday soapie called state capture She gets R500 000 and ministers get 20 million. No wonder she is singing. I'm really waiting for Zuma right now "@Thando Nkutha Yup 
2:42:55,2:44:17, Gareth Davies? Really. She seems confident to me. Not shifty at all. Van Wyk does not know he is being recorded Allways had my doubts about Lynn Brown funny how you can look at someone and just get that feeling ? Zuma wanted the commission to send him questions beforehand but the DCJ refused hai parliament will soon be empty "No wonder Mr T Ngweenya was asked to drop the investigation Yes Lyn Brown has been implicated to the Guptas @Thembisa Odendaal üòÇ chair raise your voice

Supra again mentioned we taught them how kwaaks 
2:51:11,2:53:07, only diffrence nigerians thinks it is legal Our reputation as a nation shot into pieces. @Thando Nkutha Johannesburg Council for the supply of office furniture. The fellow who got the tender had the furniture manufactured for him by a firm in Midlands which was not BEE at all. "Dipuo Peter's If you don't take care of them you'll never get paymentüòÇüòÇüòÇ thats very true This BEE is a load of nonsense Thando are you serious? The Midlands makes excellent furniture BEE has been scrapped in Nambia..... because it doesn't work 
2:53:17,2:54:52, Corruption seeped into the SA political DNA.A failed state. The Libe Chat will be 500 000 members when Zuma comes to testify. Was the furniture from Sutherland's?? @Norman Zwane I urge you my brother to sue these corrupt people for damages making you hopeful when they knew it was a sham So the NW government was another VBS sad to leave you now. going for my massage back and front BEE is a discrimination against a minority group and designed to steal their jobs @Tholithemba state is capacitated but with alot of skelms @Millicent Shozi Nice!

This Midlands firm was the bosses name Craig?? 
3:00:51,3:03:19, Cyril should declare a state of emergency and arrest all these people implicated sooner rather than later - these thieves will kill to stay out of jail "The Unions are a disgrace @Kirk Gimmel that is exactly what I thought a couple of days ago Is the owner of the Midlands firm Craig Steele @Thando then we might as well give up the fight what is happening here?? @Born free @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ I was handled by a black pastor fellow from Maritzburg so I never got to know the front end sorry. The black pastor we were told was a shareholder & its him we spoke to It‚Äôs the only way to by pass the corrupt PP legally he has to do something drastic now they must be plotting as we speak steal wheel and deal and whistles blowing it sounds like an ochestra 
3:03:22,3:06:29, This lady needs to have SC Trengrove to represent her @Norman Zwane.. please tell us we are curious ?? Govt . A cash cow for ANC and ministers. A prison for those who steal. ANC will be the majority party there you guys have sound? @Born free I know but as I say the black pastor from Maritzburg was the gatekeeper A bombshell Lynn cant put up an act to deny again She won‚Äôt only need Trengrove. She will need protection too. Flee to Botswana and don‚Äôt tell anyone where you are. @ Norman Zwane.. you must know the company and does it exist today?? Stealing from the poor who AGAIN voted t 
3:07:16,3:10:06, "Those who voted ANC are not even aware I said this before and I'm going to say it again. F#@K!! My mother will turn in her grave if she hears me swearing. No wonder greed is one of the 7 deadly sins. @Magda the only remedy is for the poor to suffer otherwise at which point do they see that the ANC is skelm "While Zundzi Mandela earns more than R1m rand robben isle can be fully functual again and afrter severving time become the new cabinet. we must assume only black people and all goverment workers are corrupt there are all races and countries There's no pill for stupidity I wonder if Cyril is listening today ü§îü§î Maybe it spared them this evil Respect for this woman testifying 
3:10:20,3:11:29, why does she have earphone? She was taken for a ride I'm with Cyril we are watching it live lol Are Ministers suppose to earn R10 Million? Yes Van Wyk could have taken it all @Sthakathi Khumalo She's listening to the playback of recording she made of the conversation with Van Wyk. "as we listen to the amounts here it is small fish and not the great white Taxpayers money divided among the looters Absolutely.. Danie 
3:11:39,3:14:29, Anne M. thanks agrittzi Yes Esidemeni "The banks was complicit I like this to come stuff so entertaining at this rate of pay-outs did the corporate make any money at all to justify it's continued exist anymore We no longer have to wonder why the NW province was placed under administration and why Mahumopelo was dismissed as premier. Makes sense R 10 Million for 5 year period in once-off payment bases All the audit companies like KPMG and a host of other private companies like Trillian were involved...the corruption is VAST 
3:14:38,3:17:35, "@Born free @Thembisa Odendaal Despite my experience It would seem the witness was paid R500 000 and then the business account was liquidated once all the funds had been looted. What a sad BEE case @Ben Cole but Mahumapelo is now chair of chairs in parliament so the more skelm the better what a waste of time @Born free Her testimony was that she swept the last R20m into a seperate account to frustrate van Wyk. She wanted to keep a piece of the cake too. Supra is Game of Thrones üòÉ The Zuma faction put everything in place for CR to fail with the PP as the main actor Cedrik Frolick..... is.....and another disgrace @Luvuyo Zantsi Yes Norman I think you are right 
3:17:45,3:20:23, @Norman Zwane I voted once in 1994 Come again... "@Luvuyo Zantsi We know the CFO lied Taxpayers will gork out R61 billion to bail out Eskom.The Chinese are also closing in to take over. "The other questionable person "she said she will get 2million per annum "After today @Luvuyo Zantsi Both this witness and Ngwenya testimonies contradicted hers. The Chinese signed 93 trade agreements with SA yesterday we will be re- colonised like the rest of Africa by the Chinese 
3:20:34,3:22:58, So now she is in control! so because she was sitting on R21m of laundered funds van who decided to fill her is and get her aboard with a longer term scheme. CR is our only hope... the ANC have proven that they are morally corrupt...... as a collective @Luvuyo I really get sick when I hear these name yes I really am not interested in the facts I heard though in the news that supra made some or other list which is disgusting he should not get a seat She gained control for more gains. She enjoyed money for nothing "@Willie Nwanati yes she is contradicting herself I always said Africa will be recolonised before it‚Äôs own people realize how important morals are? The Chinese will be harder taskmasters watch they already have their own police in SA!! She was part of the whole State Capture Corruption Project. She is a NW Agrizzi. @Robert Russell I'd be careful of that. I do not thin CR is our hope until we as a society take things into our own hands. CR represents a system. It may be refined but it is the same system. 
3:23:28,3:28:08, Correct Norman Zwane I bebelive the entire chain of the system is corrupt because how is it that the money goes into a bank account and there's no follow up in terms of sars See she can think and use big words when she wants to "@Thando Nkutha The narrative is that Cr was overtaken by the SG in order to douse the flames of these ongoing investigations. There is no way the ANC will investigate itself to death "Maybe there is need to change the political system "Putin is moving into Africa There is absolutely no benefit for SA in BRICS @Luvuyo Zantsi The divided ANC narrative is meant to suck us into thinking there is hope within the ANC. The truth is as I put it yesterday: Go into a brothel looking for a virgin "The only benefit of Chinese or Russian take over will be no crime will be tolerated by anyone not connected ! Everyday crime will stop  
3:28:25,3:36:03, Our president and his executive must and will have to fight to overcome this widespread perception of corruption and hopelessness. Do this before it overcomes the nation‚Äôs psyche and belief in SA unfortunately people cannot claim ignorance anymore like ultimately this lady will just like ms nhantsi who clearly was over her depth because being a CA does not automatically qualify you to run sa Are these airports functional??? "Of you check on Cortiption Watch I dont think the innocent SAs should pay for the evil deeds done under Zuma "Horrific repression is precisely what I am eluding to  "I hope NPA SIU and HAwks are watching "I know @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ "According to what the new NDPP said at her press conference 
3:36:13,3:44:20, There could have been Ghost employees Phew! Business Fronting is dangerous I just completed a book called The Putin System and the Oligarchs by a French journalist.I am very well read on communism and its evils across the board We know there are Ghost fire engines Any qualified lawyers on the chat group? "Deputy Chief Justice Zondo Can this witness be deemed complicit in this scam simply because it took her this long to whistleblow? Yes Ben she is complicit in money laundering. 
3:44:41,3:46:40, agree Which hospitals are closed on a Saturday? Hospitals close on Sayurdays??? Really? you must be referring to municipal clinics...no hospital in SA close on a Saturday.I am a healthcare professional working mostly in SA never heard of it At the time she was complicit because she participated and agreed @Born free That is what some of us have been saying since she took the stand As sweet as she is.. She is in trouble. @Lex Luger yes well done to sch and team and I love adv hofmeyer she is sharp she keeps these interesting she's my girl "@Ben Cole I have mixed feelings about that. We need her evidence to prosecute the big fish @Magda Seguin Yesterday you were a corruption and fronting expert today you are an oncologist -- who works every Saturday 
3:46:47,3:48:43, "@Lex Luger go to my Twitrer profile and see my work She wants us to believe that she had some level of integrity. @Lex Luger you are a troll targeting me.Get off my case "@Magda Seguin Ever heard of a figure of speech I always have a troll on my back...blocked him Please. This don't use this as a @Lex vs @Magda platform @Magda Seguin You started with me. I was just being a cyberspace citizen and you interfered with my rights. "The witness is implicated in money laundering Goodbye 
3:49:28,3:52:20, @Born free And this witness knew exactly what was happening but now she wants to play victim Cyber bullying is a fulltime profession of some people But must this witness also run? Spreading lies about hospitals closing on a Saturday cant be left unchallenged When is Van Wyk coming to testify? They will all play victims but it won't save them from their corrupt deeds. Or seek a team of defence lawyers? @Magda you should have really seen what lex luger was really saying commending dcj goodness you just made claims of being so well read and a guru of communism and you could not decifer a simple thing Well nothing has happened to all who have been implicated on this forum. Remember Agrizzi's gripping testimony? Not even a local sergeant has called anyone in for basic questioning 
3:52:24,3:54:37, "Thembisa Zika really dont need to be preached to thank you.I am not a moron. when is GAVIN WATSON coming to testify @mhleli hi daddy nice to meet you @Thembisa Odendaal Thanks that was really my point. Justice Zondo is an admirable man. His work ethic is great. Even the breaks on this commission are to the minute "BTW I blocked him Money laundering at its best @Ben Cole I think everyone must be allowed to make their point without some bullying from dark corners Gavin Watson will have to be extradited from Britian and I don't think that SA and Britian have such a treaty 
3:55:18,3:57:45, Is Gavin Watson in UK. Was he allowed to leave SA? @lex luger the issue here is people trying to be clever seriously are we so low in self esteem to behave so poorly in public no compassion for others I just want you to see I clever i am Watson has dual citizenship the NPA know where he is @Mhleli Sibanyoni I also didn't know Gavin made a run for it. He copied the lowly Guptas I dont think I will go back to live in SA ever again Hayibo she was arrested "@Mhleli I forgot Racketeering "yep  
3:58:08,4:00:22, Hayi bo. I though dual is not allowed in SA. Hence Gigabytes was NOT supposed to have granted Guptas citizenship? WITH DRAWN.....FFS....... she doesn't even care what she was arrested for. even if i was arrested for public indecency I would remember that. Racketeering and she forgets? Jiba IDual citizenship is allowed I have both SA and EU Banana Republic. You get arrested but cannot remember what it is for Pays personal bail money from company bank account "committing corruption with companies @Mhleli Sibanyoni Well put my brother. Well put. She knows being arrested is just initiation into a club of the elites of the elites of eating public funds 
4:00:47,4:03:10, Thanks @Magda Seguin on dual citizenship clarification "Yes This woman looks and sounds dodgy in her answers and body language Lesson I have once again earnt. Wait until you have all the facts before you form an opinion about something/someone. Yes from the looted money.. I wonder when the bail money was returned to her if it went into her personal account?? is what I thinks too the law is coming for you you have to choose eu or as citizenship no more both why because you want both feet one train and one on another make you choice...we don't want to carry unnecessary takers Do you make the laws? "I have money here 
4:03:16,4:05:56, "This woman is under investigation for her corruption etc. you are the well read one so consult and confirm what I'm saying I'm just the novess "In normal countries Goodbye I don't agree with dual citizenship it opens a door for criminals. "Thembisa and Born Free Commission had a timeline and must catch up @Margareth Waterboer Wasn't that a corrupt policeman on Bosasa's payroll that was trying to intimidate Agrizzi? A few weeks ago the NDPP said she would be appointing a member of her staff. The time has come for me to say goodbye to all the DECENT people who I interacted with on this forum.I cannot take the toxicity and hate anymore.Go well.Peace. 
4:05:57,4:09:34, The dual citizenship is mostly kept for financial gain because they can claim oh I'm more in the ue therefore not pay tax here and then have a moerse lot to say Freedom of speech you have no right to tell people what topics they can chat about. "Oh "Magda Seguin @mhleli get a life do you have parameter issues you decide your narrative and I control mine you can decide for your children I am referring to Sibinyoni I hope someone from SARS is also in attendance at the commission. Look at the monies that moved to different people. This woman must be recharged. Apologies Born free. Your free speech uses my expensive data on issues that have nothing to do with State Capture Inquiry = Free speech at my cost = Data is expensive 
4:09:55,4:15:40, "FOLKS Don't respond if you want to save your data "mheli.. better still save your data by not opening the ""live chat""" @MYANC was always used as an excuse to siphone money out of SOEs The Chinese people are here now? no no no no chair Nantso ke i ANC ivela pay back the money anc Is anyone surprised by mention of ANC 
4:16:01,4:18:32, ANC is a front for looters Enjoy.. Lex üçªüç∏üç∑ Will a criminal case be opened against her ??? We are not surprised.. but they must pay back all the money and rot in jail. Remember they even stole monies intended for Nelson Mandela funeral all this millions must have come from somewhere can anyone explain from where? At Danie from us the tax payers The public purse "If this lady is taken to a criminal court she will sing even more  
4:18:46,4:23:00, "maybe some of it is ""WHITE CAPITAL""?" ALL post 1994 @MYANC TGs from Msimanga to Mashatile must come give account "knowing what I know now "Lynn Brown is a looter if note  One foresees that ‚ÄúPay back the money‚Äù will become the continuing mantra for some politicians in parliament from this day on. This Babadi Tlatsana is a clown Kim too it on the chin with guarantees from Lynn that she will be looked after They were flexing their wrists üòÇ Nobody takes the fall for something they didn‚Äôt do if they don‚Äôt have gaurentees 
4:23:16,4:31:19, Zulu watch (traditional skin) = Isphandla Haha the Zulu faction Undoubtedly Zumas comrades of corruption. Radical Economic Transformation in action Here she is lying again lols Zondo is not convinced "is LYNN Brown a man or woman SUPRA is lynne the one with the big dogs? 
4:31:31,4:33:43, 2 of them Yhooo... Supra. i hope she will be able to prove these incidents and the messages. I would have skipped the country with all the lootüòÇüòÇ Hahahaha @Born free "@Tholithemba Uyaxoka lomfazi. She scammed the scammers "Supra be rolling in the cash as a parliamentary chair  @Fello Mkhize let's try play nice guys let's play the ball not the man 
4:33:50,4:36:12, @Born free Not if you thought there was likely to be more. This fool sounds like Vytjie Mentoor I would be living it up on a Paradise Island with all of the loot and under a new identity ü§£ü§£ like in balls lol Where are the recordings? I agree @Norman Zwane under an yellow black and green umbrella This woman is liar. As in the movie.. Catch me if you can @Tholithemba Ntsele She was chasing after the money nothing in principle. It's like asking the court to assist you after losing in a gambling scam. 
4:37:17,4:39:33, I will not be surprised if the Commission comes back empty handed on these police cases. "..those of U who vote ANC """Supra wants your head"" very typical" RESPECT 4 u DCJ ZONDO ‚öò @Fello Mkhize which party should they vote in 2021 "An Imposter operating as a business man I voted the ANC because JZ was no longer the president and CR demonstrates that he is cleaning up all this mess @Fello Mkhize . please somebody write a script already supra wants your head ace wants 10 percent of will make box office "proof is all over bank account 
4:39:40,4:42:18, Supra will not get away with this @Thembisa Odendaal If you voted ANC you are just as corrupt as all implicaters I have started with my book.. Comrades of corruption Now she remembers that there is a custom. She even obeyed thieves Thats your opinion @Andre Gerber and you have a right to it. "why is this thought come into my mind that in the 1970 @sindiswa moolman I will believe it when I see it ...i think we are being played this is a very expensive game so many houses should have been built Zuma thought a billion rand was a bottomless pit. Clever man with standard 3. ü§£ """Why am I not suprised that not a single case was investigated since 2017?"" That is how the ANC wins handsdown - bought the police to kill off any investigation." 
4:42:39,4:45:09, "I will remind you of this chat with you @Thembisa Odendaal Is this witness normal? If CR is displaced expect R100.00 # $1.00 how can a voter support the ANC after all this allegations.you must me crazy @Norman Zwane I think it was more about the NPA who wouldn't prosecute. I'm not saying there aren't some corrupt policemen but prosecution remains an NPA decision. @sindiswa we'll have coffee I'm in Cape town I have my colleagues in that Commission listening and investigating every evidence that comes out it @Thembisa Odendaal. "we learn our lessons "I will be there my sister @Thembisa Odendaal 
4:45:13,4:46:57, "true it is so but there were work and food and hospitals that was not just mortuarys We are at the time in our lives where I wish the apartheid government (without apartheid itself and it ways) would come back to power. I just want to see an ounce of justice Fello Mkhize You are crazy!! Apartheid was evil @sindiswa moolman I will hunt you down üòÖ Tebogo Brian van Wyk Hahaha @Thembisa Odendaal this country is rich .the government can provide for service delivery to its citizens @Anne M. I remain corrected. The ANC had by then completely hollowed out the NPA just so there is never any come-back. I have serious doubts about our ability to ever revive the abilities of the NPA 
4:47:08,4:50:35, "CR keeping his enemies closer than his friends corruption is killing this country "imagine JZ @Luvuyo we just want to see that this was not all in vain @Luvuyo Zantsi I fear that the something which is done to reverse the rot is being strangled by the Ace;s of this world at birth. This revival will be a still-born. Country is cactus @Bongumenzi Nxumalo read what's in brackets baba they must set a special corruption courts for speed of this case "@Luvuyo Zantsi SARS have not brought one crook to court yet. I suspect that will die an ordinary death. I have very little hope in all this @Luvuyo Zantsi personally 
4:51:00,4:54:16, Absolutely nothing will happen from this enquiry @Fello Mkhize I sometimes fear that it could mean there's nothing wrong with JZ but something seriously wrong with us to be duped by a guy with grade 3 "@Luvuyo Zantsi I concede on Entities "@Luvuyo Zantsi You are right the problem is appointment of cadre's on government position while graduate arr at home @Luvuyo we are super grateful for the strides but can you blame us for the skepticism they have really messed with us "I would rather the NPA take longer and get their ducks in a row to get a successful conviction but what is reason for commission of inquiry cause none actions is been taken its money that is wasted on top what is captured he is sooo corrupt. Thats why she still want her share of the loot. 
4:54:46,4:57:13, who is the main suspect in a tremendous crimes against the sa population please tell me i want to coment on that Shes so corrupt... in the big picture "@Tholithemba Ntsele I don't care for ANC who is the criminals in this state capture Flags and the female Agrizzi Just imagine if all this money was put into Education Its all ANC but with freedom comes much responsibility @Danie Nilsen There are many performers in this corruption circus.
