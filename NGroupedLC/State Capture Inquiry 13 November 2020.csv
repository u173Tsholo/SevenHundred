time,-25:58,message morning all who is on the hot seat please🤭 "@Paula Cooke Hi It is clear the ANC government is incompetent and the EFF is worse before we start the false group white guilt argument. 3 million immigrants need at least 2500 new schools. Did we build them? NO "If we have no borders @Aubrey De Bliquy do you see me? @ALTA Hi again. 🙂 @ZuenTheMan... we must stop meeting like this😂😂😂😂 ACE Magashule is in the fire now 
-25:55,-22:06, @ALTA Haha we clearly have the same interests. @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee Very nice day today. Ace and Mantsha getting fried. I smell KFC Aubrey de Bliquy i just got in time while u are talking badly about the Red bus. But since u know everything what is better than EFF?? VBs @Mntase ANC say he is innocent how do we ignore so much evidence?? @Aubrey De Bliquy?????? "If they say he is innocent ANC must be guilty for protecting corrupt people... @M Place people are desperate to see the ANC we use to love 
-20:55,-12:46, "Dee "In any case hI @ALTA sORRY MY ETHERNET WAS UNPLUGGED @Aubrey De Bliquy what should we vote for if ANC and EFF is worse "@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee EFF minus the falacious group white guilt trip which is sort of off putting because try as much as I can @Aubrey De Bliquy Probably the best comment I have read. 👍 I may vote ANC for the first time if there is an attempt to fix what is broken. @ZuenTheMan indeed we have😁😁 
-10:29,3:09, We will have to fast track effective on line home or remote schooling to bring the best teachers and language use to bear on our challenge to rise. @Aubrey De Bliquy WHAT MUST WE VOTE FOR????? ANd then unfortunately a lot of horrible ideas and nasty race exploitation for votes which makes us all victims. Especially because we are making enemies out of potential friens and allies. We cannot do this in enmity. Lets stop fooling ourselves. wow saw now some people in Bloemfontein say ace is innocent @ALTA tha is why we must never rush to judge We cannot ignore the possibility of a witch hunt. Abuse of executive power for partisan political agendae will alwyas be here no matter who governs. Nuance is everything. If you can't make things better at least don't make them worse. This is why executive and judiciary cannot be cadre deployment zones without destroying the state. That is what happens when the judiciary become a cadre deployment zone like the executive. Law cannot be selective but it must not be abused for partisan withc hunts. 
4:03,7:24, Molweni nonke! Gm Zondo Sometimes our law rightly gives the guilty immunity if the case against them was procured illegally thwarting the accused rights. White lawyer Weeeeeeee here we go!

1:32:50,1:33:53, @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee That message was meant for @zip reeper Democracy does not seem to have been a successful model in Africa. Autocracy seems to have been more successful much as many dont understand why @Simphiwe ok noted "remember this is how zuma started Huge influence in the voting is the believe that the social grants are from the ANC and will stop if any other party in power "Durr "@Sal SA 100% correct. I feel for those pensioners whilst these crooks will be eating their fat turkeys Ouma-you want to go to Heaven soon @Louis C ill ignore u i know how u Afrikaners are.

NOW i know why Juju left the party and started his own!!! "@Zinhle I agree. In a mixed cultural forum like this @zip repper 🤣🤣🤣🤣 "zweli "Ace is just one of many in order for democracy to be truly successful @Zweli Mkosana is that why the ANC was not allowed to campaign in our area and the voters stayed at home @Vuyisani Sikobi There will be civil war in that country with those crazed brain fried supporters of the Trump cult Why am I not surprised to see Ace the Crook in the Dock and 30 Crooks/Criminals in the Gallery.

Waffler "Zinhle Big Daddy Dee "@Goat - Hang in there please! It's ok to feel the way you do right now. Give yourself the weekend 
2:41:40,2:42:53, @Louis Cocaine.. this one is roping himself... he is making self-incriminating this one @Yolo More read don't rush to take sides comrade 1 2 3 @Mfundo isn't Ace Magushele camp going to petition for the removal of Cyril Ramaphosa as a president? that chair will heat up very soon and cease to spin "Goat - this guy knows all the crooks Aces' PA has turned STATE WITNESS......THIS IS A WHOLE NEW GAME NOW......

2:44:17,2:45:26, @Louis C.... its all about that bass ... meghan trainor @Mfundo but they make up a story. .you know politics is a dirty game. "Goat - K200 bail for Ace No treble @ALTA I favour Ramaphosa "Goat - What if the state of emergency has been extended in part to avoid any Ace attempt to oust Cyril given the extraordinary powers given Ace is not part of the emergency council 200k bail for Ace magashula 
2:45:35,2:46:25, "Amazing that the Magistrate granted bail "Gotta go Look at the media with the cove-19 corruption that was sweat under carpet coz we need to build the economy of this country "Well at least his bail is a bit high how come if one is charged with shoplifting he is sentenced yet those charged with stealit millions are left off the hook @Mfundo I was working at discovery in the legal and compliance department. I was the most qualified but the least paid and this made them somewhat paranoid and they concocted charges against me . @OS Muzik - it might look that way because Jacob said he is baised so maybe to keep things clean he is not pushing them so jacob cant use it against the commission later i love Ramaphosa cheers zipper 
2:46:27,2:47:52, Cyril leadership style has been accepted in the ANC... there is a little chance for him to be muted for the next term. @Goat @Mfundo okay I thought Ramaphosa had no support. some people their lucky first appearance in court their granted bail....200k for Ace cut the long stories short "Goat - @R.m. B. Are you okay @zip reeper Go well...cheers kaos in Bloemfontein. I always warn people that they should be careful when they apply for a job at Discovery. I was mistreated by Indian people and there is no doubt that my skin color has something to do with it. 
2:47:54,2:48:55, get the Gupta thievies extradited to sing . 6 houses for asbestos cost r200000 bail for ace "the court support vanishes in the near future Goat... he has support... all people who don't belong to Zumas camp the have him as an alternative @ABRAHAM .... yes the groove @Goat - your story fills me with GORE! Ace must just rot in jail. @Nemabubuni Geoffrey - Okay I see bro. So ACE stands no chance. So Mantsha wants to read bundles of evidence ayi 
2:49:01,2:50:40, I can do my own analysis -I dont need some dork at enca to do it for me-get off my screen "@Heather Durr - I am fine thank you @zip reeper tata geniet jou naweek hoor You said you were robbed "Ngobeni Akane "@Goat Like I said I suppose R 200K is short change for Ace hey? @Mfundo yes you can say that. And the thing is I never looked at Indians and saw racists before the discovery incident. I thought they were our brothers. But now I see what EFF meant about Indians. "Naledi Barron 
2:50:43,2:52:06, president Ramaphosa reminded the public to wear masks 1 2 3 again His sons can pay it from the covid tenders they won @Xolani J Masemula @Mfundo LOL! In a previous lifetime. I DO have HR/Training qualifications amongst others. @Xolani J Masemula 200K is really nothing plus hes already getting donors @Louis C - Even the HR department was against me. And HR department was represented by an Indian woman named Reshika or something like that. She was biased and was intent on destroying my career. "Goat - shame on you Tony Yengeni Kennedy you MUST have something-bank statements 
2:52:15,2:53:34, @Anne M. true. Or Carl Niehaus can pay for him😄 "The head of the governing party has just had a court of law lay 21 charges which include "@William George yep "#Goat @Zweli Mkosana what happened? ohj3 Why do I have this sense of having been here before?

2:53:36,2:54:58, "Goat - :thanksdoc:Ace Magashule is out on R200 000 bail. @Xolani J Masemula they should have set it at 500k.

2:54:59,2:56:01, the large gatherings like in Bftn is what experts warn about regarding the spread of the virus. If we go back to stage 3 or 4 people must not cry foul. when was ace arrested? @Sal SA these pastors are scams. @Phala Makgoropane - where have you been😂 "Yup @Goat - I can certainly assist you with your CV and job hunting strategy! @Naldie can you help me look better on CV asb ----even if I am way past sell by date :-) "@Goat - In Solidarity @Phala Makgoropane this am when he reported to the Hawks office before court 
2:56:02,2:57:16, @ yolo he is so emotional about this ace saga to point where you see he could even assault the journalist. @Phala Makgoropane this morning when he handed himself over to the hawks What his first name? Curry?😊 @Phala Makgoropane he was arrested by email @RduP Sure! "@Goat @Megan Diedericks - Yeah I think what is making me see it as a race thing is all people involved were Indians and pretty much around the same time EFF was going around saying Indians are very racist mxm is tt wat is called arrest? Conditions of Ace Magashule's bail is that he should have no contact with witnesses and submitted his expired passport. But not very long he got aircraft lift to Zimbabwe 🤷 
2:57:24,2:59:02, @Mfundo - You got connections? @Naledi thanks. People fearmongering about #COVERT19 are getting boring. Go check the numbers and get a life. Numbers don't lie. people do. @Thabo Mokoaleli 😂🤣😅 Why do have to endure this Geneaal KAKhuis with his mr price army onsey? "@Goat Indians have more jobs than any other ethnic group. @Eddie Reddy - where is the company? My awful experience with Indians at Discovery has significantly affected my relationship with them to be honest. It will take long to recover from it. "eish @William George the sad and painful truth is the higher they set the bail 
2:59:33,3:01:05, Denel owed a lot. How come when they pride themselves with their work? DUDU ACE @Eddie Reddy: 25 wow in a country with thousands of large companies....It does say ALOT! "Having met at the Gupta's residence with Essa he is party to the corruption "@Xolani J Masemula i think its best if it goes back to the state The DCJ has found his voice...... And they cannot even make a president of a decent hindu American lady of impeccable integrity like congresswoman Major Tulsi Gabbard form Hawaii. @Louis C - And what is worse is I only worked there for a month and the second month I was facing this nightmare. Thanks for support . The way Discovery handled the matter was honestly atrocious. @ Goat I'm in Durban. 
3:01:08,3:03:13, "@Goat "This guy looks like he had a bottle of jack ☠:hydrate: before he came here Dissolve all political parties.

Politicians cannot manage what they cannot create politics and business are like matter and anti-matter which anihilate one another when they meet.

3:07:33,3:09:26, goat how is Bianca @Smart Guys.... is this the old goat? @Colleen Arezio I presume he is explaining to the witness the purpose f the law. The use of hypothetical is illustrative.
