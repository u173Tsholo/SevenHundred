5:25,9:37, They called him no.1 chair @Naledi Barron 🤗😘 Am looking out for goats.... I have found that with ZA black Africans the boss is always referred to as no.1. was not sure where that originated. now I know. @Naledi Barron they seem to pop up so now and then lol 😉 "@Sanjay Maharaj I think that originally "@SanFran Arnold Ever heard of the fairground game ""Whack a Mole""?" "@Naledi Barron indeed Dat's my Lady B!!!!!! 
10:41,15:03, @Sanjay Maharaj Quite correct! Pity that this honorific has been denigrated in modern society. who is this witness? "@Sanjay Maharaj former General Manager Very strange chair Dankie Lady B Info Ninja!! "@SanFran @Naledi Barron always a pleasure hun. hehehe This witness was interviewed for NPA head "if I was 2IC to the boss 
15:32,19:11, @Naledi Barron unlike the fruitless and wasteful expenditure from so many government depts. Dumelang bagaetsho @tumi dumela 🙏 "@SanFran Arnold And even more obscene is the fact that there were people like me @Naledi Barron Its just wrong. You give the right way forward's but not agreed to because it does not fit politics. this witness thought 🙄 @SanFran Arnold I gave my country my heart and soul i.t.o my expertise & experience. Retired now. I couldn't handle it any more. Alfred 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 The state opposes bail for Agrizzi 
19:16,21:26, hi-0✋🏽 "@Sanjay Maharaj agreed @Mzalwane Mzala Oh excellent news TY!! though ...... @sabeliwe this guy was a puppet "@mzawalane yes Mzala he didn't disclose crucial information. "...in the previous live stream...I said Hi-0 ✋🏽 ....and then couldn't find the link It's ok @Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ We see you. 
21:27,24:28, @Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ hi @Sanjay Maharaj Agrizzi did not declare assets that are valued in Millions and some of these are in foreign countries. "@Mzalwane Mzala have they denied bail yet "@Mzalwane 🍎🐛 Agrizzi handed over to the state a South African passport in his first case but did not reveal that he is also a holder of an Italian passport. The decision on the bail has not been made yet. We have been Aggrizzed and grizzled by Aggrizzy. ag rizzi .....so he was an Italian? The state said that he did not disclose his Italian passport and that he had made deposits into an off-shore account. 
24:47,26:35, is an Italian @Mzalwane Mzala thanks He recently transferred about 11 Million Rands to Italy. was..now he is South Citizen Petamonga 😳 Italy bazonya still holds an Italian passport. ZA recognizes dual citizenship. only one with dual citizenship is not allowed to vote in ZA 2020 is a year of note! 
27:33,29:51, it's boring at the commission today Not really "...there's one Italian in india "@Sabelo Nxumalo It's all about building blocks Como and Pelosi are Italians that undermine the Government of the United States of America "DCJ needs to connect the dots and the dots are not always the ""big shows""" Q-anon @SanFran Arnold Exactly Lady B! Naledi m tired of connecting dots. 
29:51,31:43, @Naledi I agree. "The US is undermining itself. Obama started this along with the Democrats by inventing this ""Russia fear"" out of unsubstantiated allegations." "Bank of a America is owned by Italians. ever why a slanted font is called ""italics""?" I am still questioning why was Agrizzi allowed to auction his house last week. @Sabelo Nxumalo That's ok. Just tune in some other time down the line perhaps? "@sekgololo 🤣🤣🤣 Mafia al-capone "This animal called 3bee must be stopped on it's tracks 
31:52,33:50, "Yes chair "Mr Lakhan. pelosi is pure evil. she wants to revoke the 25th amendment so she can replace Kamila harris with biden as president "@Diana Sekatane BEE is just for the elites stopped watching tv shows this is much more entertaining [ loud whistle ] woooooooo. yerrrrr man correct Johannes.

37:10,39:17, "@Joan Lombard Yes "as I was saying I agree @wim louw "@wim louw he came out as a crook @wim louw 100% correct. I was amazed by our precise he was in transferring over R30 million out of the coutry since he was implicated including buying a house in Italy. and then the lost passport? Agrizzi is a flight-risk. "If you want to lock up criminals start with Bush mr zondo zumas friend must not tell u "@Mr K Lakhan ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ When anyone says ""YOU people"" 
39:38,41:01, i agree val. When @Naledi joined this chat over on enca I knew this was going to be Added Value and I was right "They must take his passport and list him at all ports of exit as a person involved in fraud. His testimony still stands and he has proof @ Aubrey..thankyou I agree totally. let's address eachother as brothers and sisters not you people "🤔 I was thinking @Absolom Nhorito Amen to that!

He got fat paycheck for being incompetent and negligent Trump's victory in 2016 is another reminder that people vote in elections based on a variety of reasons. I find it strange when some in South Africa expect us to vote based only on what they hold dear Shame herb Yes DCJ show him what you think of his ethics as a lawyer yourself..... second highest in the land Even Zuma got more brains than trump Yes DCJ. There was dereliction of duty on his part. Page 21...let's go Italian mafia. why they got so sensitive for that statement? 🤔 
49:45,50:53, do any of you on this chat have the intellect to follow the inquiry ? Try reading the comments here....
