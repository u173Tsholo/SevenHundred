Pages 6 and 8 missing... @Stronger Malema has been vocal about WMC... he ddnt start at EFF... and being against WMC doesnt mean one is anti White ppl this one is going to sleep like she normally do in parliament. "WMC was a term the Guptas made up "@Yolo More ...You can also throw R50 into the pot. We will all go to Sam""s house and buy some meat." think for yourselves "Pastor J 
51:34,55:58, @stronger no no no... he said we must direct our anger to WMC because they are the ones who employ foreigners... MAITE STOP BEING STUTTERING Hahahahahaha @Yolo More but ANC is stealing all the WMC tax which should have been used for improving poor peoples lives Ewald Kruger 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 please stop. "If ""PROTOCOL"" was a PERSON!!!" @Bianca WMC is real... lord Hains was telling us we should believe in white man..remember what is going on with Independent media..coffee shop..Eskom CEO..South Africans woke up 
56:05,1:00:15, Why can't she just explain her understanding???? I see companies that were involved in this state capture mess are closing one by one fast @Tikvah Olam ....You are so right....and soon hopefully he will be Prisoner #5467 We all have our holes because of hard times caused by apartheid. Ewald Kruger. Elliott Chauke..now WMC is in charge of da country just dance for their tune "Guptas and Zumas are the reason this commission was established Stuttering is one of the signs that you are lying yebo I bet he was never suspended or his pay suspended. 
1:00:18,1:02:29, This one is nervous shame. "ANC is fronting for WMC... WMC is in charge tell us the triue Are you racist Yolo? Nervousness is another sign that you are lying. Keep them coming guys. The Guptas were in charge. The ministers were only there for formalities. "There is nothing to prove? what are you saying "What is the obsession with WMC She is trying to put law in front of her at all possible means 
1:03:10,1:04:29, "This one has no comprehension Hahahahha lol Can you imagine the poor advocate that had to sit with this woman for days to get he affidavit out. must of been excrutiating Private Sector is 100% WMC... and now they are infiltrating SOEs soon we will be back to apartheid. and 25 years of ANC corruption @Yolo More absolutely not everyone is as close minded "minister used to be articulated 
1:05:03,1:07:10, # sanction guptas White Monopoly Capital infiltrating😭😂😂😂 what's going on with her? shes nervous? "@Stronger together This Mother is not nervous.. thats how she speaks ANC failure Immanuel she was never the same after her health issues. The system failed ANC 
1:07:19,1:11:25, "There's no excuse for aiding state capture @yolo minister has health issues? i was not aware🙏 Thulani...the people that holds the money are not normal people. How is 10% holding the money. makes no sense. the other normal people work for the money. should the money tree just rain on everybody Lets make up some new words....lets call it BMC. how is possible that elected anc memebers abuses 75% of the countires wealth? ANCMC Zukile Mawisa who blamed apartheid for looting? Hard work gave those whites all the farm lands there in Robertson @Stronger together? Surprisingly I didn’t see a single white person working a field so where is the hard work? ANCMC I think WMC stole land and set up farms for themselves and today their grand kids are reaping the benefits. 
1:12:32,1:25:22, ANCMC stole my taxes now we to pay too much for electicity etc If state capture and corruption had not happened even i might have been driving around in a Hilux. Those in power stole from ALL of us. Yes that is how settling works. South Africa was not owned by anyone 300 years ago. the whole world was created this way. get on a boat and sail around and see nice piece of grass. and put a tent #ANCMC Someone on this chat recently asked a poignant and pertinent question on Corruption etc. When did it actually start. Did it all really happened with the ANC only? One just had to be clever enough to build the boat. Interesting statement by participant at conference the other day made the point that apartheid gave rise to union movements now union movements contribute in escalating unemployment. Agree fully. Billions can buy millions of houses Unions the stumbling block of progress and self preservation 
1:25:41,1:29:23, The Minister is still reading two pages. We do not want to hear excuses for failure - we want success. If those appointed in top jobs cannot succeed give the jobs to those who will succeed. Excuse me Trillions can build millions and create more millions All rise "Yolo..this ""minister"" is not the sharpest tool in the shed" I see Bongani Bongo was arrested this morning MSG Rules true. This GOGO must go home in Limpopo to learn to be inyanga Whom else for the past 25 years 
1:29:24,1:31:41, Elvis Malokoane you're kidding!🙂🙂 That means NPA has started working mos. lets take the view that unions will collapse SAA and SAA close down some entrepreneur will establish an privately owned airline employ new staff and use existing infrastructure . @Rob Nel What if we focus for at least the last 50 years? "Makes Choma yolo More yes they picked him up this morning for corruption "Corruption became mainstream when someone said ""we did not struggle to be poor""" Must go to that FREE STATE to learn to be inyanga maaan seems the Chair is leading the minister or am i delusional here? seconder👋 "Pastor..is the last 50 years relevant 
1:31:43,1:33:31, "Abel Matshidiso "@Rob Withers ...Do you remember an episode called ""Infogate"" or a Dr Herschel Rhoodie?" "@Pastor J Do so Witness leaves me with a sense of unease. Haven't quite put my finger on it yet. @MSG Rules It is relevant when we talk Corruption holistically and not selectively @Rob Nel I do agree with you pastor j yes do remember and those involved were punished even prime minister resigned Minister with a hole on her head Any company got its lawyers represent the company therefore employees also need their representatives which is the union's 
1:33:54,1:36:01, Pastor..for what is happening now there is no value in beating a dead horse. "Immanuel "Maite Nkoana Mashabane is very useless imbecile and dont know what is she still doing in Parliament as she is only best at sleeping @MSG Rules You are absolutely right. My question was explorative and from a simple point of interest. Nothing else. How did this lady become a minister & MoP?? She has low esteem very useless strategical remember she has a hole in her head. hahahahaha She is pretty. 
1:36:02,1:37:34, @Thulani Bukani . Absolutely spot on. How far is the SIU? or do they want evidence to disappear. Which party does she belong to?? ANC Thulani the new horse is ANCMC. and it is alive and kicking The hole in her head is where what she sees and hears escapes and bypasses the brain ANC MP LIKE ZUMA remembers nothing I can't see anything in this woman to deserve such big position given to her she can't remember ha ha Judge almost choked 
1:37:35,1:38:39, Makwa she cant even remember what she had for breakfast SHE IS VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT SHE SAYS. With this poor/lack of self-esteem no wonder we as a country are stagnating. no one takes responsibility when asked. but always ready to take more money. "Sboniso Sabelo DCJ has been through this evidence before and he knows there are gaps that must be exposed. I think there was interference in Koloane's redeployment. I honestly cant gather why people vote for such Zukile - don't think she is cautious. she has no clue what she is beign asked Appointed in position or deployed cadre? 
1:39:11,1:40:52, I hope Anc see this mistake they make when choosing ministers Give her a MOU when someone of her caliber says..since 1994 then you know she is going to tell a long winded no value story Ndlozi must wakeup this sleeepest She was and still just an ornament. Sabelo please be serious even ANC is a mistake to govern our country now "She is deeply corrupt and unintelligent is the minister answering the question? I agree with you Makwa 
1:40:54,1:43:03, So the President gets a list...…. No she is not answering. she's jus not giving the answers u wana hear What an embarrassment... proudly brought to you by the ANC #Pathetic "she remembers what happened in1994 but forget what happened in 2013 she doenst understand the question so make up lies and stories She's not answering the questions. We don't want stories. Gogo is being gogo now. She talks a lot of unintelligent nothing. 
1:43:10,1:44:22, She might be highly intelligent playing the dj and commission like puppets she might be trained to bs Same WhatsApp group as Zuma Brought to you by #ANCMC (monopoly capital) Aren`t we having vibrant people in parliament who can lead this nation to prosperity "notice her body language we as taxpayers are paying huge salaries to these kind of incompetent ministers. Are we nuts to accept this? This one will be in st jones church to give us spuit(mmamoseletsi) same watsap group lol! She who disgraced her country. She and the Zuma delegation to Davos did nothing but bank their stolen money in Switzerland on that trip. 
1:44:54,1:46:36, Total Embarrassment She thinks she can 'smile' her way out of this. when she talks generally her voice is loud when specific answer is needed her voice go slower What is a fine diplomat? And what value do they bring to regular citizens? She trained others...help this country lol smile She has verbal diarrhoea. She must not generalise. She functioned within her intellectual capacity. her voice was the last one needed. 
1:46:56,1:48:23, Bathabile Dlamini is back in goverment the alcoholic madam Clueless what point are they pursuing now? Madam is pointless really so you dotn need a brain to be an ambassador "eish  She paged backwards lol the comments on this chat is making me lol former former president hahaha ANC 
1:48:33,1:49:46, If she is lying plz guys help us with the truth go to the commission as long as you ran around burning and looting before 1994 then you can be an ambassadot Did she sell her brain to the Zupta? She's fumbling. *ambassador Serious circus indeed! this minister wants to Implicate Pres Mbeki. ha ha the list..if you went to prison Zondo will work hard today to clarify questions 
1:49:50,1:50:38, There is few things i think they will show her and she is not gonna answer at all this is warm up Imagine her being in the same room as people from other countries in the same position She is suffering brain drain She thinks is a joke Everyone in the room seems be treating this inquiry as a joke. Her expression as a former ambassador can only confuse the audiences and population of other countries yes she is She's diverting from the topic The hole in the head is now big is now a passage 
1:50:40,1:53:12, Stop it! And he flipped off the country. She's interested in deployment positions CIC Seriously we are a joke to other countries and circus also "We as South Africans should be very proud of this commission She's defending Koloane All depends on the ruling party 
1:53:27,1:54:44, Answer the question gogo. Is there a pool or not? Serious things are starting... CIC is about to address the Nation. lets all tune in...✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿 A perfect example of how low the ANC's intellect has sunk. This one could not even get a job as a check out girl in real life. Sabelo we must love our country than any political party This is the first time the chat is filled with people using reason. We are the true South Africans! Chair seems to like the minister a lot😁🤷‍♀️ "@Elliot I wonder what level of education she has ? Now the clown in her entertains the DJ 
1:54:45,1:56:14, Gogo must go training to be inyanga "thanx to the commission now we know how much our leaders shallow are CIC = Criminal In Chief why inyanga Commander In Chief... President Julius Sello Malema... eat that wena bed wetter I wish people would realize that this is what you get when you lower the schooling standards. Did she passed matric I wonder🤭 "All the female state capture thieves love showing of their manicures is this Top Billing or state capture commission 
1:56:16,1:58:05, "@Bianca Arnold Please help spread the word Matric here no no no matric in ANC There's no diplomatic work but shopping. 🤣🤣 @sboniso matric for what? for who?😁😁 @Zola Pinda lol It reminds me of Hlaudi lol 61 Billions 2019 in corruption said Kimi makwetu 
1:58:18,2:00:10, Who are senior citizens? Senior citizens or skilled diplomats? "Every time she opens her mouth "You must give Hlaudi credit I dont think he even realizes he was used Ah! Prerogative again. So a private individual can be appointed. No problem. How are they screened? sorry meant to say Hlaudi does not know what he does not know. This is so boring! CV's are olds school Chairperson """All you need it talent""" 
2:00:27,2:01:35, "i miss ms hofmeyer "All you need is talent""" 61Billions stolen this year "If it was ""Hoffman"" she would have been called a racist" why this woman still a minister? At least we know Zuma learnerd English while he was in jail but here I'm speechless She doesn't know. Non career diplomats from senior citizens....are you kidding me Talent to do shopping in exclusive shops 
2:01:44,2:03:02, her brain power is a problem even Zim dollar can be stronger than her brain This Minister is so clueless @makwa we should be grateful it could have been worse the R61bn Zone must feel like someone is drilling him through the skull talking to her She doesn't know how it works. lol she must not be a minister I think at least from the look on her face she knows what she does not know. chair is boring and charting up there 
2:03:15,2:04:53, 61Billions n we should be grateful no no no Is this the hole in the head minister? "Her IQ This enquiry is embarassing the ruling party on how they elect EFF channel is streaming the presser... if u watch on sabc/enca/newzroom thy will cut the feed once CIC starts to hit the nerve @Paul Buchel she failed her IQ test So President Zuma promotes ambassador Koloana 😳😳😳 She might do better as Min of Mining seeing she has hole knowledge She was an ambassador?? Where? Hopefully Zim 
2:04:55,2:08:06, Chauke you are polical exactly she has answered nothing This hole Sate Capture Inquiry is a joke - you can see this people that come to this hearing come and talk knowing nothing will happen to them - mostly a blame game. ( he say / she say ) "I agree "Only in South Africa Purpose of this interrogation ? GET GOING !!! @Rob Nel om that iq test joke has me crying The this and other scenarios clearly educated by JZ She was deployment officer in charge of THIEVES 
2:08:08,2:09:49, "guys its not a waste where does the notion that failed politicians are deployed to ambassadorship come from! she was trained well to represent herself to this commission on how she was going to spit the lies. i so wonder how the ANC elect the ministers lol president malema is addressing the nation president malema? you wish Christian W ;- you are right. "Koloane is found guilty of breaking protocol. Get's suspended Oder Adrian Malema will never be a president 
2:09:58,2:12:41, Eish will this minister be president? "She stole the answers to her IQ test She is repeating herself and not answering. BRAIN DEAD "These people are results of weakness in the system @Paul Buchel lol Julius populist days are over ....he got the spotlight he wanted "minister is lying and evasive "@Zola Pinda he is guilty nothing was done this koloana no discipline 
2:13:16,2:16:30, "Julius is forever monotonous So the Netherlands did not vet Koloane? Its the Dutchmans fault again...…... "Jan v Riebeeck Koloana was supposed to be fired but they didn’t do that instead promoting him to be ambassador Who pays the salary? pretend that you are full even if you are hungry Trust cANCer voters will rethink their X’s after seeing this 30%er in action 🤬 "So you not allowed to steal in other countries. OK Can only hope 
2:17:09,2:19:26, why cant she just talk maybe she needs a translator """Who pays your salary "" She's supposed to be answering the question but she's not" she doesn't seem to know her work. there's a frog in her throat steenhuizen has no degree???? wow @Bianca Arnold​😎🤣🤣 @Stronger together dont know why hang up with Steenhuizens qualifications.

Yes she did what about his misdemeanors!Was he the best! @Stronger together maybe... not sure what is required if she is qualified There was no disciplinary action taken This bull was always coming!!!!

Hlaudi 😂😂😂 "How does government employ ppl of such calibre to represent the country worldwide "This is very funny This witness had a joint or a few Irish coffees at the tea break. Otherwise she's an empty vessel she just said that they would have no one working for government if everyone was disciplined This is disgusting bana!! a minister !! her husband must turning in his grave beaches he was a very intelligent and ethical person ---he was Ambassador too

2:45:37,2:46:48, These fools make me change my mind on Zuma. I think they used Zuma's name on their corrupt ways. Not suggesting though that he was clean. "DearANC Zuma must have understood her very well "So many senseless parables @Stronger together she is baring her teeth im sure Zuma and her slept together Did the punishment befit the crime??? Keep on voting for the ANC. You will be appointed If and only if you condone criminality i think a rock would understand better than her.... Hope CR gets feedback on this performance. Really poor. 
2:46:49,2:49:05, Zuma must have understood her very well when she made these recommendations. Very well looks like brains remains an important part of ones body "Wish the president is watching 😂😂yoh haii noor Love the way slows things down. As if would be able to keep up... social media is gonna rip her apart hahahaha Keep up sho! please nominate me No it's about what Zuma knows.

"Yet in this case humility is a way of making chair accept her vaqueness @Concerned South African thats exactly what she is saying Zuma knew True recommendations

He even awarded her for the fabvour she did for him "no "IF THIS IS HOW THE SA GOVT OPERATES She is lying \. She made the nomination on instruction from JZ. is this woman stupid or illiterate or both Tell the truth. Zuma told you to recommend Kolwane as payment for being a sacrificial lamb

As if he is the idiot. She's lying Did you tell him or not? "Stop talking in riddles "@Elvis Malakoane

This women... Is this woman the best the ANC can offer?? hmmmm heres the big question 
2:54:06,2:55:38, There was information omitted for Zuma to consider woman. she.must just say yes or no I 'll steal. If you dont catch me it is not my fault. LMFA @Elvis Malakoane "It is very ironic that they speak of 'procedure'  mybe she needs an interpreter "For pity’s sake please please PLEASE Judge Zondo stop you confusing her zondo is also confusing
