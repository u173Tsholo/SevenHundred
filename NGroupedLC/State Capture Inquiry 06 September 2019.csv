37:20,38:39, @david cele u are very insecure and cheap y0ga9p South Africans have disgraced themselves The Zanu PF are still in power in Zimbabwe. This is a huge problem because there is no change in the regime. I think this guys should not blame foreigners because it is their responsibility and mandate to push their government to creat more job opportunities. "People in rural areas eat fake and expired goods from their businesses. they occupy every every street corner end-to-end The world is laughing at South Africa Celeü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ VOETSAK YOU FOREIGNERS WE ARE NOT CONCERNED FOR YOUR OPINION you must go home and fix your countries why are you cowards here but you run from your problems

No - the name of the game is - handouts It is up to parents to tell their children not to take drugs. I mean where is the supervision or guidance for these children? @This Is Balls why? ya you like slaves yes boss no boss 100 rand a day boss oh shame shame @Born free - agree

GO HOME PLEASE. We will still be friends at your places of birth. and you will have to pay the right amount for work "i think SA has alot of crazy people who get whipped up into a horde and a frenzy and destroy stuff and attack people and rob. Thats the problem "Nigerians are not drugs sellers @Moshoeu Mabusela you're sick with racist xenophobia South Africans should know that your people are also in other African countries and they are surely going to retaliate. no one believes any different 
41:18,42:20, Porous borders create a problem 1 out of 50 doesnt sell druga maybe @Pikachu I'm not lack of parenting skills here in SA has destroyed this country. some guys are fathering children and not take responsibility. @Jack wait are you black? they must just leave us in peace your government is diverting you from state corruption. to xenophobia attacks. @Pikachu as a spade lol
