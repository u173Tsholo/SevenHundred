11:31,14:56, Just hope today he will make sense uself how they even got the position as Director generals. Thats why our state entities always run at a loss just read a artical Zuma says CR knows everything about the Guptas while he was his DP here we go again lies lies lies and more lies.tell the truth it will set you free "Lorraine it's not like that "Lorraine i do agree with Zuma on that one @Kabelo Katjedi Gives you a clue why kids smarter than them would stand no chance getting a job when these goons remain in charge. Just like the PP who investigated them....getting fax numbers wrong. @Thami Nobela Today is indeed a very very sad and dark day in the lives of south africans and particularly the community of Marikana. eish Lorraine sori I lost you lol today I'm sympathetic with thus guy... he drank Buffalo milk and it messed him up...

19:30,25:52, OK we will discuss Marikana later on it's live feed in the afternoon It will take a looooong time to get this country back on its feet @Lorraine Naidoo Zuma is doing everything to bring others down with him. CR may have known but was pushed to the corner. if he knew why all thiz witness not say 'we met with Prez & DPrez' Another 40 yeras Im suspicious that their qualification might have been bought via a cup of coffee at mag &bean while we complain about unemployed graduates. Thats why the ANC believe in hiring this old useless people Mr Thabethe is working for which company now world he is on pension OK thanks Lucre 
25:53,32:56, c izihlalo zikamama @ Exam adda let me block this Exam guy eish This man had been arested and the NPA withdrew the charges...Sean Abrahams? creating Muslim population in non Muslim country. "This guy ws nt supposed to be released in jail he rather speak the truth than biting tongue This here is a pathological liar!! Tjerrrrrr!!! Oh pleeeeease man! What a load of rubbish!! 
33:32,38:50, "He wnt  he is almost on the corner who r these person No shred of truth will be obtained from this mafia "my question is whether anyone will be prosecuted from these proceedings give him a break 😉 Nadia Botha youre 100% right "if the commission is a waste of time I guess the guy he spoke was part of the 30% 
38:56,43:13, "The state should just sell every property belongs 2 this crooks morning ppl...who is the criminal in question today? Millions stolen and our babies are sleeping in the street and dying. And yet we vote the same people into power who have failed us because of nostalgic views. zama ke thabethe ka maka Former Free State agriculture department head Peter Thabethe "Gerber im personally watching it 2 witness the outcomes and hear whos implicated so that i can take my vote somewhere else.They will b telling us that media ws exaggerating @Nadia botha Yes we vote for them because we had it with apartheid people. we do want to go back there with the DA or FFPLUS. "Lets hope that something does come of the commission "this Thabethe guy is lying and it's clear 
43:18,48:54, @rosalind gerber you dont understand what i was trying to bring across. I am wondering whether or not there will be prosecutions otherwise what was the purpose other than exposure of corruption "Thanks Nadia "yes I also believe this commission is a waste @ I Am Free. The taught their descendents that some people are either garden boys or kitchen girls. So their sons and daughters know us as slaves. @Moshoeu Mabusela we as are limited to choices of one corrupt to the other. Maybe if they allowed independent candidates running.We will have honest people not bought by corporations or wealthy people i totally agree @Nadia botha This is modern day State Capture and Corruption. Anyone here remember INFOGATE OR HERSCHEL RHOODIE? @ I Am Free. evidence is everywhere in this country.

Exactly how much do we spend per day on this enquiry???? @rosalind gerber I hope so either. 😁😁😁 @Asanda Asanda I think they are Revered rather tha Worshipped. 
1:06:45,1:11:28, @Moshoeu Mabusela we all hope to find genuine people in the struggling country of ours. My child is of mixed culture and I pray everyday she will not be treated unfairly because of it "It is such a pity that many black professionals I think Parmalat etc should come before the commission. I think their story would be different. "Can he just say chair you know what we Fd up excuses are always plenty both ace and msebenzi must be very ashamed for what happened in Vrede especially for the poor Communities free money no one can refuse You steal the money man!!! He's lying 
1:11:37,1:15:09, Zondo sees right through you. "just want money He keeps lying the truth shall set us free. land expropriation "He never consulted. If he did  may i ask what this about thanks "@Buyiswa Mnyani I'm with you. I thought "suspended you should have been fired 
1:15:23,1:18:47, @Abe Molefe True Its either hes protecting someone or saving his skin land expropriation!! you will find the owns 90% of the land after its been expropriated. the Chinese This protocol oke doesn't know what suspended is.

He is lying this is as a direct results of codesa1& 2. set up by white ppl and their cronies. 
1:18:49,1:23:25, they on a break again the Judge is exhausted listening to all these lies! ANC is corrupt and their the ones who are capturing the state with their indians and white friends.. and thuma mina won't deal with unemployment he is a business man.. and everyone is scared of ANC When will Ace feature in this commission guys? after you christy...you have to account @liz..the gudge is also ANC like of the SA gudges. "Nceba Duma Ace busy at Estina milking cows dead cows didn't the researcher say Vrede was not a viable place for dairy farms 
1:24:25,1:32:15, that was why dairy farms were closing down in the free state all the the land that is viable for farming was stolen by white ppl. so Ace had no option. Amandla..... "Larger corporate farms have more of a direct path to the grocery store than the smaller farms "@Nceba Duma no one wants to deal with small farmers let alone emerging farmers because it becomes too expensive and complicated so blame the whites for stealing money from estina? they need to bring back our land and stop this mickey mouse commission and give it to Ace and his cronies yes ace and his cronies please. Mawubuye! 
1:32:51,1:37:20, maybe you are one crony "This man is lying now I agree. they must comment yes that one is not telling the truth "@makhosi nobhatyi lol "maybe not JBrown. maybe its my view India South Africa long live this commission wil never end 
1:37:35,1:44:37, He is covering up his decision to jump to India @ Buyiswa Mnyani . Surely these companies would be very willing to assist these poor people lets end it Reven. I agree Where is the money now with that decision you took sir Thabethe its just more money down the drain Will this commission be concluded in December as envisaged? I really doubt at this pace "No! @I Am Free Please never after this one cr 17 CR17 is the last hope for the white elite in this country. There are other ways 
1:46:35,1:55:58, "awaiting statements from Nestle goodmorning everybody..this man came back. he is brave Ace will crush Zuidland @I Am Free - agreed - Cape secession makes sense - what about KZN? "this prosecutor is very sharp love it. black excellence this prosecutor is on point lol even in US This witness is a big liar .He did the investigation and recommodation 
1:56:47,2:02:41, IS A TRAINABLE LIAR problem is you understand nothing😂😂😂 lixoki lotata uxakene nelife kulo sitting here we are not tallking about trips to overseas India. we are talking about our land chief and Mr Magashule is Ace. why we have to account about issues of kand in this day and age issues of land chair chair india? lol. try Africa The curry and buffalo milk is better there. Terrorism and Corruption. these two concepts are problematic 
2:04:07,2:08:06, what does India have to do with a diary farm start up for emerging farmers in the Free State? they are always used by colonial forces to defocus our ppl on a genuine struggle oh my golly-gosh-gee. @makhosi nobhatyi I see you can't put something into force BEFORE the agreement is signed I wish i have these reference bundles HH something theyre taking about 😟 I don't see how colonialism has anything to do with going to India to learn about dairy farming. I had a well deserved holiday but followed the news Nice to see the familiar people here 
2:08:48,2:12:46, Hello Magda @Magda Seguin Welcome back Magda.

Parliament is a joke there is no order especially with the delinquents.. the EFF 😀😀 @Ewald Kruger. I don't have even an ounce of his patience. Ryan Smith you are not experienced into multiculturalism or non racialism culture Everytime the EFF open their mouths.. it costs them money 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Why was this witness suspended because he is a bigger liar thanZuma @Ryan Smith Welcome back....I love your calmness this morning. Let's hope the army is well prepared. 
2:21:36,2:25:57, "this guy is not afraid to come back and tell lies EFF gives some people nightmares EFF are fascists 🤣🤣 "The PP was given another personal cost order by the High Court due to her Estina report..the justement is damning *judgement When has Zuma been invited back to give his testimony?? The EFF are delinquents. The wheels of justice grind so slowly in ZA 
2:26:13,2:29:41, @I Am Free howzit and now Nigeria😂 How many lies do we have to listen to before Police come Knocking ? What are you these features that differ to the features in SA?? @Ryan that is what Cyril is supposed to be. but clearly thats a shambles too. @Moshoeu Mabusela I have no problem with them holding big business to account. My problem is that they display fascist and racist tendencies. EFF stole from VBS which is a civil servants pension fund This guy will get caught 😂 Check the competition commission report on data must fall and bank charges. include insurance companies on shares. 
2:31:04,2:32:44, This not kfc @I Am FreeCheck Check the competition commission report on data must fall and bank charges. include insurance companies on shares What a LIAR EFF are thugs and bullies.

I think they should invite the public protector to come and explain her judgements 
2:32:46,2:34:23, this guy is speaking so many lies his head is shining already😂 @aurelia nqeto No - they weren't and should be held to account if any evidence of that is forthcoming. But the ANC have taken corruption to a different level - they have perfected it. this Judge has lots of patience with these liars "He just cant answer the question "Thabethe what is your size for Overall and shoes Go to Kenya! Amazing programs supporting small farmers - amazing expertise.!!! WHAT CRAP @Moshoeu Mabusela I'm not angry - just saying it like I see it. Sounds like you are looking for excuses not to engage. WHAT CRAP 
2:34:26,2:35:08, @Liz Profe His patience is phenomenal. I am in aw of the DCJ. India is not high in its standards at all @Derek Main What about INFOGATE. That happened during Apartheid times I think. Truly we are not a stupid Nation Name Companies in SA that wouldn't help ......I doubt that this is true...... Big companies should sue this witness.The way he put it their milk is not up to standard exactly pitso Kenya knows from experience that it needs white farmers and Investment . @I Am Free. I am not talking about who is working is out of the question. am talking about stealing related to big businesses. 
2:35:10,2:37:48, I am free thats not my question. I asked if you say 17000 is too much to pay a mine worker What a LIAR "@Pastor J As I said above you on teh right track judge!! "@ I Am Free What a LIAR...DID I Just hear him say Local companies were no interested pagal sala wheres my respirator

Sorry for the confusion. The Infogate was but one small case in which the corrupt were held to account. There was far more Nat government corruption that went unpunished. the guy is trying to pull a ZUMA by talking about unrelevant issues. who is your Queen caught out again @Derek Main Yes. You are indeed correct. Crap
