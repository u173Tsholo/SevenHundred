"@Mfundo.Evidence leaders are given different workstreams like LEA Thanks @Mfundo - his time has come & now he's running scard! 
15:07,16:30, the commission should have a bailif or sergeant at arms to nab these absentee witnesses "lufuno shumani muloiwa Mashaba is trying o pull Zuma's stunt! @zip reeper agreed Refusing to appear is a clear sign that you are guilty of something........... yes Sir DCJ "Lerato Moleke Adv Soni is a brilliant and methodical legal mind. Keep up the excellent work Mashaba = Swifambo Rail ( Now In Liquidation ) Was The Unknown Entity That Was Shovelled In To Take On The MULTI-BILLIONS Tender / Contract Scam For PRASA Afro 4000 OVER-SIZED Locomotives From Spain 
16:30,17:25, Mashaba is in deep trouble here and his lawyers are to blame too "yes Chair The quilty are afraid.. It takes one person to set a precedent.. And the rest will follow.. Act now.. they are guilty 😂😂😂😂😂😂✋ "sibongile matlala DCJ very serious now  Poor legal advice from his counsel The attorney must get hammered as well 
17:34,18:34, Arrest those that do not want to appear. Start with JZ.  People are starting to make a mockery of the commission. "Zuma is going ""he he he he"" while watching this and sipping his tea" auswell forgets he's not zuma unlike abo Koko and Brian why are those other RET forces defying summons? they must come and prove to us that indeed this commission is biased. This clowns of RET forces are misinformed 🤣🤣 "you pay for a lawyer. they give you an illegal advice. they submit. you are liable for their advice. you get to face the night of the law. you pay them to defend you there mooooorning 😊😊😊 "Moffat Segal "Attorneys of these people should be dis barred

Lolz @melds melds  
21:06,22:26, @Kubeka correct. The zuma faction orchestrated it all. Morning @Mfundo  @Mfundo.Apperently allegedly the younger once wanted to be paid more & the madala took the lesser amount. But I totally agree with your view. "The problem is that there are no consequences morning all They all think they are above the law.............. Why cant the DCJ in his Capacity as a Judge and not the Commissioner issue and authorise a Warrant of Arrest.????? "Too late Banana Republic!! 
22:45,24:24, "Read the address "You stole our money "@Mfundo yess but those are real looters abo Ace They are all taking queue from someone which is so desturbing The commission will now end in June with the 3 months extension  "Zuma knew what he was doing "President Ramaphosa can pardon all these criminals including accused number one..Zuma @Mfundo the report has to be completed by then Those attorneys and legal representatives must be also held accountable as to why they are playing hardball. 
24:40,25:33, Melds what is treason? @Valencia J I agree No show admission of guilt. "lufuno shumani muloiwa "Once criminal behaviour was allowed during the 9 wasted years. Then the criminals got bolder @Pastor J.J. Hope u well bro. I think it's better if warrant is issued by a court to create impartiality on a very serious action The law enforcement that went to arrest Zuma at Nkandla had tea with accused number one instead of arresting him. what is treasonous about not complying with the summons? halalaaaa tenderpreneurs halalaaaa. 
25:34,26:34, "the chair has to little powers zuma supporters let's wait and see who is going to win at the end. DCJ and Cj both two are very strong 💪 let's wait and see 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🙏🙏🙏 @Pastor jj well I think he is there as a commissioner/chairman more than as a judge. "Mfundo completed how hopefully the cops will knock on Mr. Snot Well's door shortly ! @Sabelo Nxumalo Zuma's treasonous actions as he set an irresponsible example Judge got bigger balls than Zuma. Melds what is treason? "@mahapa one is strong with our stolen money 
26:43,28:16, @Sabelo Nxumalo google it "melds melds @Mfundo EXACTLY!!!!!!!  @Mfundo my problem exactly..how can they be radical whilst they are living large at the expense of looting state funds meant for poor ordinary SA citizens.

28:34,30:27, "lufuno shumani muloiwa "Sabelo Nxumalo @Mfundo. And the looters are led by uBaba Zuma who proclaims to be the Father of the Nation. Which father steals from his children? DCJ was too soft on some ANC cadres like Zuma and others. Now he is baring some teeth and must quickly get over to biting some of these state capturers. Arrest the Attorney too. Thank the LORD he is not my father "@Sal hs might be father of the zulus "Sabelo Nxumalo should'nt the attorneys at least have the decency to appear and try to defend the no show ? "Vodacom hasn't paid mr Makate as per Constitutional court ruling.ngabr lokho kungukujikela umbuso 
30:31,31:04, @Mfundo the problem started with Bongo & Mahobo for dismantling State Security as we are now vulnerable in all spheres of government. Law and order will be tough to restore in SA Pastor jj yes you are correct but those things he used to attend is nothing to do with the commission. @viure. They should be dis barred!! "So its Mashaba who thinks its not legal Brian Molefe is still not here? 🤔 zondo should have read all this last night and cracked on with other business now Mfundo nabelungu abanendaba nawe.its all politcs. @Sabelo Nxumalo that has F ALL to do with this commission boetie "Sal SA 
31:08,33:27, They are also disobeying the law. @Valencia. Yes and his followers too Looticians and racist have robbed us of being one of the most progressive countries in the world  @Mfundo. Very sad. There are none so blind as those who refuse to see. i fear this low wattage monologue may drag on for some time "@S V 1 indeed so the attorney was supposed to come with Mashaba to challenge this not to do a no show "9 WASTED YEARS. Mahatma Gandhi once said "" If we have an Idiot leading Government then those who voted to elect him is well represented"". Apt and true" everybody will refuse to go to commission to answer questions they followed on Zuma steps a constitutional delinquent we need a putin style president in these cases

People like Sabelo are sell outs. Let it go. "@Sabelo Nxumalo hahahahahaha I see that have you brainwashed too............wonder what happened to all the soe's Thabo that would be if they feel the justice system is not protecting their rights 
35:28,36:57, What happens to advocates who are party to undermining the law in this fashion?  the bar is set so low that even the lawyers of this country is a joke "Mashba thinks that 500 billion makes him elite and above the law. Funny thing I have identified my first lucky 123 candidate for today what you guys expect from a man who had sex with his friend daughter whom he knew was HIV positive without using protection. what does that tell you. why ppl are forced to counter the allegations against them hi everybody 👋 yes advocate @melds do it girl

Thats a no no I have always held the view that the biggest con perpetrated in the Republic was when we had a change of government. Lol...What's this RET brigade? How long have they had power and what did they do with it? Even our current president was once part of that RET(At least he gained conscience along the way).  "@ melds melds Silence..
