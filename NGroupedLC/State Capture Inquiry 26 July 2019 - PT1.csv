Ruppert can leave if it suits hime "@Melvict Melbourne 
54:07,56:18, Ow that tie plz lets keep this chat on topic and not this boring race thing be happy in what you are I have a question "@SABC Digital News During the tea break Because you are not ready to judge white people joke joke joke I do not think Zuidland will work. We will build it up make it prosperous and the ANC / EFF / white haters will then just complain about land theft and so forth A person who has two children can help them to be successful in life. A person who has eight can only give a quarter that amount of help to each. Simple logic. that logic is racist 😃 
56:50,58:51, Why do you name streets after criminals? I have a question Dominoque I totally agree with you but look down seems like economics and logic is also racist being racist is surely painful hey🤔 please focus on the enquiry and stop insulting one and other. the chat can be so much better when people respect each other. easy to insult @Dominic Przybylski the reason more children are born is that they get registered multiple times by family members to claim up to 10 child grants per child.... each child is worth around R8k per month "Not too long before someone pulls: ""Oh no you called me racist now I can pull my trump card and get out of any actual discussion cos I never cared anyway""" Can anyone change history "the reason why we can't be productive 
58:54,1:00:58, again Masked K are on a race train and it seems he has a chip on his shoulder being not white leave it and comment on the topic fraud corruption wich is raceless all are guilty or not in this country X stem Micheal Wild "today all corners of our township tuckshops are owned by our foreign fellow brothers... let us learn from thm Haaaibo @Robert Russel such lies @Robert Russell Each child 8K.Where? A child grant is around r780 per month x 10 times being registered R7.8k I ask again....can you change history? Mthuthuzeli Ntlanyana my question what stops anyone from starting a corner shop 😂🤣😂🤣 
1:01:22,1:03:08, He was intoduce to them @Robert Russell Proof? "@Mthuthuzeli Ntlanyana I dnt think we are lazy Mthuthuzeli Ntlanyana I have never killed someone but just because I am white I am a killer? @Francel van Eeden some people are creators and some are consumers the Afrikaans interpreter is better than yesterday's one Ask Home Affairs and SASSA.... that's why they are going to start finger printing new born babies to stop the theft Melvict Melbourne I agree but for that reason we can not use it as a blame game tool and to catch future criminals 
1:03:29,1:05:14, "I'm with you on that one...as this race he will make a mess with the glass.. "All babies are fingerprinted at birth @Robert Russell so all you have is ""I have heard...""" Saxonwold Shebeen! @Amanda Watson You are absolutely right. Well said Not when applying for a social grant @Amanda Watson Appreciate that @i am free..

1:10:06,1:11:55, "Saloons owned by foreigners @Bedazzled why do you want to forget an history even a bad one remeber it so it does not happen again like what is happening today with commissionand enquirues about coruption and theft are we better now look more like 5 cm So you are telling me that new born babies are finger printed at SASSA when applying for a child support grant??????? @Mrs Anderson agreed 5 3cm "but they fed themselves  5cm nowhere near 15cm

1:17:37,1:21:18, 00 "For the last time.... a mother registers for a child grant.. the next day her sister takes the same baby and registers it again @Mrs Anderson U are 100% right. Thats why I questioned @Robert Russell Melvict Melbourne dont understand your humor. I will say the same to you BAD TASTE my friend i should think that a birth certificate must be handed in not all people are corrupt some just do thier thing Robert that is the origin of coruption and yes there may be such cases but surely you dont want to imply that that is standard practice Zambia I bet origanal namibia born but in sa now for 40 years in freestate @Francel van Eeden I'm not saying it's standard practice... it was in response to why some people have so many kids.... and I know this happens for sure 
1:22:21,1:25:22, I can believe that ther might be such cases and that must be reported i only farm in kitwe on leased land and are stil an south african at least i am not a target there and are safe from any crap happening now in south africa I have heard of people having kids just to get the grants but I have not witnessed it so I rather not comment on it Primitive cultures have big families because they expect only one or two children to survive. However with modern medicine most now survive so there are more and more people but land remains same. "@France van Eeden @Robert Russell i am baffeld @I Am Free Are going to have that discussion today? It is sad to what extent people will go just to get money. Best thing to do is ionvest time into projects to help people not destroy people to invest 
1:27:15,1:32:56, I am frree lets hope it will actually be utilized for that purpose and not to enrich certain people Population in Africa is growing faster than African economy can grow. Result is increasing unemployment and result of that is increasing crime and ultimately collapse and starvation. @I Am Free Moodys warning report is also the contributor to this 1 USD to ZAR = 14.1577 "Policy uncertainty I am actually amazed that the rand took so long to weaken "We need Ethical Leadership if rupert does not make silly statements to enhance the stockmarket to drop and he can buy cheap and then say no he will stay and the rand recovers and he sells at a profit One thing I must honestly Add to your coment Nkululeko Zondo is politions must do there work they suppose to do and leave our people on the ground to carry on with our lives @Francel van Eeden Rand is buoyed by Brexit. Everybody moving their pounds and euros into other currencies. Rand will dive in November. 
1:32:57,1:37:37, agreed @I Am Free the rich does not care about the poor as long as they can keep on making money they are happy but at least we get some employment from them I am free can I make a statement and will you give me an honest answer @Francel van Eeden Politicians mostly never worked or started a business yet they have to solve those issues on our behalf. They corrupt and not ethical but some are doing a great job. 11:15 one thing we must not forget that is that the goverment is not rich it is tax money they misuse for them selfs all the vat taxes and other taxes are not thier money I feel sorry for the rich. They have to spend all their time worrying about losing it. I prefer to have just enough so that it isn't a big loss if I lose it and am free to explore better things. "SA economy is a Triangle shape and not sustainable If you had bilions of dollars and employ thousands of people but most of the population just lambast and bad mouth you would you not want to leave to a place that is more welcoming 
1:38:25,1:42:11, i sit and enjoy a nice glass of wine i never mix politics with business. Heh! Anyone who believes any politician will look after them will be disappointed. Nkululeko Zondo so why do we keep on voting for them "...Politicians have all the police services for protection because of their corrupt forms of law "The ideal situation should be a diamon shape economy where majority are tax payers/working why did the poor bred like rabbits 50 million and the minority at say5 million 1 or2 per family why have more than 1 wife but a lot like cattle an breed the country bankrupt @Francel van Eeden we vote because we have to. But lets get involve and make them see what we see and influence their policies. Business must be majorly involved and assist What is more important - democracy or freedom? they. ust just arrest everyone 
1:42:26,1:45:51, Nkululeko Zondo totally agre. we should use our only democratic power we have and stop voting on emotion but on reality @I Am Free you are correctly This is somehow changing with the new generation The politicians of all colours try to get their supporters to have as many children as possible. It's the source of their power. That's why we don't hear any politician asking people to have less. @Francel van Eeden i think teaching people as now will help unlike parties flooding people with campaigns just before voting days. Eish I don't wish to be Deputy Chief Justice Zondo.... "Is no coincidence that China became powerful after enforcing one-child policy @I Am Free leaving on a cave wont help 😂😂😂 we as a country should rethink the filosify of out breeding ourself ot of being destatude and the young ones dies of malnutrition and not enough work

2:20:01,2:21:48, Corruption is EVERYWHERE in our system! True! @Nkululeko Zondo Combine monopoly SOEs with powerful trade unions and they will rip everybody else off. Nobody will get rewarded for working hard or putting customer first. TRUE! This will be the way Free land will be destroyed by uneducated farmers @ I Am Free a policewoman told me that it is illegal to buy a kitchen knife from Pic n Pay and carry it home. Believe me I did not faint. "Why all the boermang cant speak english 😂😂this man he don't know english? They were just picking on you! 
2:21:49,2:24:45, Boer by their nature cannot speak any language They speak 4 languages already! TRUE! "@Dominic Przybylski you 100% spot on YES! "Thembahlihle GET them ALL who are corrupt! WHIES included! Anyone on the chat is from UMBUMBULU in KZN???? @Nkululeko Zondo Is not possible in current system where politicians get to choose how much tax we pay and get to choose what it gets spent on. We need to move away from top-heavy government. 
2:24:46,2:26:35, "Ohhh so Meneer Bason putting himself in trouble now. Wat sal jy doen nou? switch on captions if you want a giggle...it's hilarious BBBEE het iets vir die boere. Interesting. Tenders! pastor J...NUL is here hi boring lol My personal view is that when you run with the corrupt you ARE corrupt also! hi Dallas 
2:26:36,2:29:05, I always knew that black empowerment include Afrikaaners @Sphe Mdluli Me too bro why don't you stop profiling CORRECT! lucky person Current system based on hierarchy is obsolete. Networks of individuals and civil society will replace it (4IR) based on social media. Will be a new different kind of revolution. Captions are histerical How did you get THREE farms????WITH everything on it(animals?) They should send people to agriculture schools and if the quality with good Mark's then they should be send to start farming with land that is monitored and if that person reaches the goals they keep 
2:29:10,2:31:12, Greedy Boer😉 Menner is tired now giving unskilled people farms. wheresd "Michael Wild Black government IF Basson was guilty..he deserves the penalty that will follow! @Thando Nkutha Agreed give me a farm too why dont i benefit from BBE AGREED! 
2:31:54,2:34:25, SAD! I phoned the Landbank to buy a farm....they didn't want to sell me one. The interpreter is diligent! Other interpreters can learn a thing or two from her "We shouldnot feel alone captions are funny He had to sell well run farms and now everything has been sold and nothing is functioning now. that means all employees also not working. it's like taking the CEO out of a company money money money !!! milks de cattle grow ur Bank Account👍 LOL Sounds like Zim style land grabs.....! 
2:34:29,2:35:53, Thando listen to what they saying. I LOVE this STATE CAPTURE!!! GET them ALL! The Witness leader/lawyer looks troubled by the information being provided by Meneer Bason what more does this lady need to know doesnt she have the paperwork since he sold it to the government. asking the same questions "@Michael Wild correct They have to be SURE! @wesley lotz looks like she is going somewhere with this dont say they. direct to the Person you mean. sterio type is a big issue money in de pocket for Mr.Basson dead catţle 
2:36:11,2:38:06, We could have never pushed ourselves anywhere together. This country was not built on those foundations I can't name 50 million on this chat That is what happened in Zimbabwe too... the farms and all the equipment and cattle were given to the rich people/ministers who just let them go. So the farming industry failed. @ x x...it will never be possible here because white ppl never wanted to becone neighbors true they sold everything freedom of association. Zimbabwe is in so much trouble. Bedazzeled you are living in the past! "@Sphe Mdluli why would I want to be a neighbor with someone that don't share my culture 
2:38:14,2:39:58, Slave has to master to be a master. I am merely bringing you to the reality of SA mindset So when every one is given a their land and FREE tractor.. I think there is going to be a huge 2nd hand market for tractors and farm implements..which can be sold to Zimbabwes white returning farmers SA needs to raise the education levels. it's the most important thing in SA. I would prefer to live among my own people hulle moet dit verkoop Bedazzled: We must change this mind set QUICKLY! You cant spend 400 years thinking like a slave and hoopdy doopty all of a sudden you have to leave your thieving ways behind @Robert Russell if the tractors survive without being broken and vandalised. 
2:40:17,2:41:56, he just said the most important thing. The new farmers need to be monitored. if they dont reach some goals they must be replaced. farming is a business. I have changed it and it is a difficult process. I have messy on those people because I get them "Thando no one lives for 400 years idiot this white man is right though🤔 Bedazzled please keep it clean. non racial You hand over a mindset smart one. I am just trying to get a point across admin so your attitude is genetic bullshit

The level of greed and corruption is at global celebrity status. this is dangerous now We already know who they are read the book! "@Phindile Thando he is against a mafia that would not stop at shooting anyone to hide there story 
2:53:05,2:53:45, dont endanger yourself now get things in place and then speak....they will try to make you quite i thought you guys are not afraid (they will shoot me)😆 INTERPOL is the answer! leave black and white out of it and look at it like good and bad. Yes Mr Basson is fearful of Jacob Zuma;be very scared its the lack of capital why black farmers can't cut it in RSA and in Zim for those who are not aware the spark of farm killing started like this.(whistle blowers) The problem about divulging the information is that they can even come for your family. I cant afford that at all. Very dangerous indeed and scary for families involved 
2:53:47,2:55:51, they won't distroy the ANC. neverrrrrr ace is polishing his 9mm..lol and gov wants to chase farmers like Basson off land nice only us all of us south africa is a country for all the people who lives in it Look like he wont even finish working on the bakkies Ons soek daai melk ook. this man is in grave danger now Africa we will be like the rest of you VERY shortly! and sometimes the goverment does not pay at all that is freestate goverment 
2:56:04,2:57:08, So the fancy gate doesn't help at all. He must be protected otherwise he is doomed NO Was this witness interviewed by our current PP? die boer woord deur die melk gedrunk LOL "like speaker of the House @Nellie Price thanks to RET yamsimba What about Thandi Modesi's cruelty case for neglecting all those animals on her farm... 
2:57:51,3:01:39, LOL If more of the holes leaking Govt funds are blocked this country would be doing very well. Our kids futures are being stolen. pp will be in kanyamazane celebrating her party 6th birthday farm killing I like this guy don't know why Don't put your life on it. Basson you can keep your land and brave too 
3:01:43,3:03:36, "Basson Remeber this! ANC consists of WHITE and BLACK members! I like this Basson guy. He is spitting poison. Die Guptas must be trembling wherever they are hiding. he will loose his contracts and money and farms within the next year. the influential people will stop at nothing to destroy this poor guy now True! "He will not loose anything..When you help black people to ace magaskelm @Gratian Hewitt you are funny. Thanks 
3:03:41,3:05:07, If they are brought down without any reservations as quickly as possible then he won't have a problem. Start a movement and we will support it. It is not about black and white its about influenced people and the police and npa "Mr Basson is a ""stoere boer"". I hope he has concrete evidence of the allegations his making now." Its only funny if you have never lived closely with a black community @Danie Nilsen I like the magaskelm name I lived among them for the past 50 years who does he knw bad English if he can't speak it Me too! amoung and close is very different 
3:05:11,3:06:49, Among and closely with is not the same thing He can understand that. "i have worked with and for black people most of my life and now in kitwe i am not "" awhite' I AM A FARMER" Thanks Tamzyn He can speak English! It is better to translate for the sake of the INQUIRY! Agrizzi told him to tell the truth 😂 I wasn't sleeping with them. so tht he can be smooth too It is better if he speak in his mother tongue so that he can express himself 100% 
3:07:06,3:08:40, True! i am happy that he is embarrassing his africanism @ nellie True @ Maria Raboshakga Really? How? True Maria This paints a sad picture of rural South Africa and poverty contrasted by extreme opulence funded by money intended to help the poor. JUST SHOCKING!!!!!! Jankelson said dairy farming is a science. It is! it is. 
3:08:45,3:10:18, the money was supposed to be used for the wedding bra Imagine people drink contaminated milk! Ace Magashule is the real charlatan and wedge driver @Thando Nkutha agreed but people choose to ignore that for no reason You don't just get a cow and give it grass and it give you milk Malema must also disclose how him and Zuma worked to remove Mbeki anyone that thinks farming is easy should go try it for 2 months. and also experience drought and bad weather. animal sickness and all the other things that come with it. it's a big company management True! @Michael Wild HArd work indeed 
3:10:23,3:12:10, GOVERNMENT? hmmmmm theres gonna be lots to discuss this weekend at the ANC NEC crash meeting People think farming is easy and farmers are rolling in the money. very far from the truth. Commercial farming feeds a nation but subsistence farmers only feed themselves or a village... Farmers work hard for what they have Thando you need qualified people that have the skills and backing from Banks and farming organisations. if you fail to pay debt you will lose all that. We are in this food shortage already because 30.000 farmers are already feeding the Australians!!! IN Australia! In the villages it is mostly the women...because they are not lazy. 
3:12:18,3:14:24, "True "if you love what you do  Basson sounds like a generous ngamla "they farm seen @I Am Free ​ and we now wake up every morning at 10:00 AM "I Am Free! I understand that more is going....another 10 000 that means that only 10 000 will be left to feed this country! Scary very true. like he said he felt sorry for the animals when he saw them in a bad state. that's a true farmer "@Nkunz'emnyama what does ""ngamla"" mean." 
3:14:25,3:15:09, "The cow grows fat under the Master""s eye." "That EFF shirt  lol Antonie True! "Dankie Meneer Bassaon "Basson is salt of the earth He has to think for his life. We are really grateful innit! @Anti Suz Whiteman haibo antonio 
3:15:24,3:16:11, This is the type of white man that south africa needs. its just a shame that the comment section has racial tension while such a man speaks. TRUE! Its Friday. Give Bason two tots. he will say the names. they can eat te ground lol @SDZIMBIRI MKHOMBE Brandy & coke hehehehe give basson some bells i like meneer basson a true man They ARE eating dung in other countries that had the same problem! Those poor poor children! 
3:16:16,3:18:01, Thank you Mr Basson. I think he will leave too! We like you a lot Chair @Tshwane Yamošate lol 'exfoliate' he is also a funny man He is! just l00000ve DJC ZONDO! the chair and the advocate are great! "Yes
