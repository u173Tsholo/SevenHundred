People are now dying of starvation. Maj Gen Nonopi postponed - Covid? "Zondo has still not produced/publish anything to help Dominic there was a legal issue preventing legal action until commission finalized. Legislation passed this week to clear this Dominic Przybylski​ FFS DO YOU NOT READ THE NEWS????? 
8:22,18:56, Easy Karen Why administer the oath when everyone claims that everyone else is lying. Yes @Karen x I do read the news. Today I've been reading about how funds meant for saving us from the pandemic are being lost to runaway corruption. I'm reading how even more billions are going to SAA They should be saving for a second state of enquiry. Surely Zondo has seen enough to produce an interim report providing some guidance on what has caused this corruption and what may be of assistance to prevent even more of it. Dominic this was raised previously and DCJ said it was not possible People are still to give own versions and cross examine "That's our most urgent problem. Everyone now knows our country is riddled corruption but everyone says it is ""not possible"" to do anything about it." @rohan barnard i lost 15minutes 
18:57,23:19, @rohan...they trying to load the R10 Data Voucher.1 Digit missing Hhahahaha!!! Rain has lost signal again 😛 "@rohan barnard  Dominic I have great respect for DCJ @funicanz....we still faithful and signed on to both channels for the 1st time sabc is doing something right 😀 Hi @funicanz Robert McBride is a thug how is robert mcbride a thug? 
23:29,27:18, "@Anne M.  "He protected his pal """ I KNOW DE WITNESS this guy is actually making sense how? @Villager Man...You say that as a fact? Why is it at the Commission then? this man is charged ..Zondo get ready is it a fact that he squashed the initial report! Arrogance 😬 
27:18,28:57, how did he squash it? Oh this is bad for the Director of Foreign Intelligence. Sorry for those that have been protecting him blindly. @Village Man....The first report was considered a draft and needed to be amended with new fact before it became a final report Morning all This guy is on an agenda Morning @Jacqui Baumgardt "@Pastor J . He changed the report completely to protect his own friend This man is fired up! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 This is the most action we had all week! 😀 eish - these challenges to the commission - 
29:08,31:51, why is this July guy so emotional Who is July? missed the start due to transmission @Villager Man....Thats is not factual according to the evidence though @Sal...works at Werksmans "@Pastor J  he may /might have changed the report. the question that I think he is emphasis the difference between the two. So he was employed by Nathi Nhleko to investigate IPId reports pastorj so enca is off today @Elvis Malakoane they need data donations 
32:03,34:11, @Jacqui Baumgardt there are too many kings and countries involved here. @Elvis....I am running 2 pages. still faithful to the end "@elvis @Lee D. Hendrix - agree - more like cowboys and crooks though An investigation report cant even be changed by anyone who didn't carry out the investigations. Its only the prosecutor who will refuse to prosecute or ask for more information about the report. Rohan Barnard they must do it fast cos they are disturbing us Now we are squatting here There is no such thing as a person actualy doing a job in government... @Elvis Malakoane eish ja! 
34:35,38:37, Now he's just rambling All these ewxcuses are the design of State Capture instigators to collapse the commission! Mark my words! why do they sound like they missed the lecture on those reports "class is in session again with the files being disorganized 😢 Chair is very attentive. and the table doesn't know whats happening "The fact is that these people are idiots. That could never pass an on the spot comprehension test "@rohan barnard  
38:39,42:18, Ask an idiot to fix something and they will make it worse... @funicanz i have no idea what your talking about 😅 Corrupt Politicians must fall heebana mr july delaying tactics "@rohan barnard  *sweating intensifies* I hope Nhleko is watching @Hadley....If they fall they will just bend and pick it up like they try with the Rand/Dollar 
42:26,44:01, sounds like someone is trying to start up a gas generator "Maybe lets wait and hear Mr July but the clutch is not giving mmmhrrrr mmmmmhhrr he must refuel 😆 @Pastor J right behind you I suspect mr July is attempting to justify his fees I need a PA here...Anyone free @Pastor J - today is 31 July - payday for Mr July 
44:21,45:36, @Pastor J I am available as PA @Jacqui....You are too sharp today Sister...i Like Camon Zondo..interim has the same meaning everywhere..even here in Zambia @Pastor J where is Bianca @rohan barnard - you pipped me to the post @Carl Botha handing out PK's to ENCA @Carl...On an assignment...doing a citizens arrest as per instructions 🤣🤣🤣🤣 🤣🤣🤣 
45:46,48:12, can someone explain what todays meeting is about ? ....Corrupt politicians are afforded esoteric advantages and the public is never aware of the decisions. @MOSA MASENGANE - it's about the reports submitted to Nhleko that he bumbled on about for three days @MOSA MASENGANE The report issued by Werksmans Attorneys around the rendition matter conprocZambia looks like interim in terms of IPID act has different implications on its operational phase @MOSA MASENGANE and where Nhleko made examples of the whole day for 3 days without actually saying anything ohh thanks guys These people have to be payed to have this conversation? For real? They are literaly telling each other how to do there job... Surely the final report is the overriding report 
49:45,52:28, @Sal SA..NEED WE SAY MORE. "Question: Why is there evedince in your devision of corruption? Eh the report Would think so @Sal SA Everybody report for duty! Its confusing that's why they mess up the job. Even the DCJ is battling to understand this hogwash they are just playing with words about why they ignored the report from the IPId @Abel Matshidiso agree ok any mods on here? i have a grievance 
52:49,54:47, I doubt if they gonna finish in 2 hours time like the chair suggested check "I am lost "They have not managed to settle on a single point "so the problem here is the report #DIRECTELECTIONS "At least someone with intelligence is on the witness stand enough now!!!!!!😓 DCJ and attoney sizing each other now. 
55:00,56:59, :goodvibes: Zondo already knows Nhleko was lying through his teeth I mean they have not been able to fulfill the basics of a constructive argument or debate... This is insane... Zondo you now interiming everything...😂😂😂 Trump Can declare martial law 1 hour of nothing!🙁 @Jacqui Baumgardt And wasn't he a poor witness? after this interim conversation Zondo will want to take a tea break lol This was ment to be a big thing to give people hope and inspire citizens to believe that action is being taken. Anyone in chat feeling inspired or hopefull? 
57:36,59:08, i report for tea time @Akhonamandla Gala the interim break as he will say Tee Time. that is my finial report. before the final break "@Sean 😂😂😂😂 "@Sean Collett  @Pastor J still looking for a PA? Yay! @Bianca A

She was on an assignment she is back now....I am heppy heppy to leave loopholes @Pastor J glad it’s sorted. @Bianca A woohoo!! "unbelievable  @rohan barnard 🤣🤣🤣 What's up guys? 
1:00:25,1:01:53, "@Bianca...But Investigation and report are inextricably linked - you cannot separate them Morning @wim louw @Sal SA That's what I thought What's the issue? Are we dealing with terminologies? "@Vuyisani Sikobi That is a myth made up by South Africans. Beleiveing that anything to do with government is slow and hard to make happen Get to the real issues!! This guy hiding under definstion of type pof reports "@Ahkonamandla I fully agree with you. I’m such a fan of Zondo General Salute 
1:04:01,1:06:54, "22nd of January is my birthday "@Ahkonamandla He should also NEVER HAVE ALLOWED these implicated politicians to come and explain for half a day "Compare this process to anythig BEEE @Ahkonamandla Having set a precedent with it he can’t now stop others doing it. Waste of TIME Which report? Your Gr3 report that you went to class with a certain former president? 👀 "Margareth Lots of hearsay Robert McBride was protected by the cabal. he is a thug who should be jailed. Villager Man you are out of context 
1:07:08,1:09:10, schools are closed.collect your report at the Commision @DMF. ok who is this guy? 😅 "@Villager Man Agree with you zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz........ "This is realy getting interesting "so which one is now a final report? the draft "...Yes

Geeeeeez ! DCJ has a brilliant memory. 🤣 @village man nhleko was protecting the cabal @John Everitt 🤣🤣🤣 "It is interesting to view the proceedings of the commission  "@Bianca A ..agreed 
1:12:21,1:21:58, DCJ make your rulingas u put it - January report was not final "It is interesting to view the proceedings of the commission  "@mbombo mp A genuine funny! Priceless But Nhleko said final report had information removed "the zondo commission should fire these incompetent investigators "...Who modified or had superior input to modify each of the reports concludes in about 2 more months or so WELCOME SIR excuse of the west when we have the sovereignty to say no is far fetched because we keep going to them Hubert spoken like a true zanuPF 🙊 sorry ANC 🙊sorry again !!Spoken like a true citizen🙉 
1:22:08,1:25:42, Colonization happened but what is happening now is far from colonialism. We have had this country for way too long to still be blaming @Bianca A True They prolonging the issue with technicalities. Surely the properly signed off report by the Director is the final report. "zondo attitude is amazing @Bianca...True....Failure is blamed on everything else but the actual acts that resulted in failures. "Yes Hubert @Pastor J 👌 ...@Bianca A ........ It kind of seems that new colonies are being established more so.... "@Carl..@Bianca....Like I dont have a job or money and I blame something else...Not 
1:25:43,1:34:07, "The only thing unique about South African colonisation "🙈🙉🙊jones plz stop 🤣😂cnt u lie a bit n say smtng dat will make Hubert happy @Pastor J you right this is not the time for blame game is time to take full responsibility for your actions @bongile....very very true....the govt is too busy with perfecting corruption to be stressed about us..And a 100 years later we are still focused on colonialism.what a neat excuse for our own failures "...HUMMM! "@Lee D. Hendrix it is what life does..colonize..look at bees and so on. It is what humans will do on Mars Hay Hubert ( Nice Colonial Name That ) : Why Don't You Bring In and Blame Apartheid For State Capture / Corruption / Looting / Thieving ... Juss Like Ricksha Ambulance Buyer GOMBA ( Eastern Cape ) ! ! very energetic when are they coming back?

1:51:35,2:03:23, looting is the mother's milk of many African countries "@Bianca A  my guy pleaded wth me not to ask him to read English written in vanacular😅🤣 "@Lee D. Hendrix they were colonized and yet they did not sit back and complain. They took what was there and grew it. We sit "Bianca A  @Welcome Kamogelo We are blessed with humour 😁 Why is the issue of 22 January as a final report so difficult to understand even if explained in simplest forms Critical investigative info deleted. recommmendations drastically changed = ? ...Zondo is seeking the authoritative figure in the report sequence. 
2:03:40,2:06:28, 2 hours to classify a report as interim or final Rohan Barnard 😀🤣🤣 it is my final report that the interim draft report of the 22nd of January is the final interim report and should be accepted as the final draft report for the interim @rohan barnard 🤣🤣🤣 Deletion of some of the report contents is done or supervised by someone who was not even employed during the whole investigation. Big difference between laid down procedure and practice "blah "so in layman's terms investigative* 
2:07:06,2:10:12, Leon it's acceptable if that person is the superior and will sign off "After 22 no additional info i am so lost in this reporting that it feels like im reading a news24 report "it is bcz Mr July say a final report must have all statements "...The invisible person signed the final report @Rohan....I am Praying for your sanity bro...I will send you and updated Report soon I will understand it better when ET phones home 👽 @Pastor J yes please. Reports are zooming in my ears. A PK of reports "here we go again to the 22nd of January 2014. Are these people time travelers? If so 
2:10:46,2:13:16, the report says nothing! Can it speak then? @rohan 2020 is overated indeed:goodvibes::goodvibes: The aim is to nullify 22 report so as to legitmise the changed report. @Rohan...Sorry Son...If we take you back to 2014 you will not allowed to be on the chat....Only 18 and above is allowed with PG "2020 was never a year @Pastor J luckily back in 2014 I was 24 😛 The guy is waffling Anyone who can advise us what informed the deletio of evidence and change of recommendation. Sunday Times also implicated instate capture eg SARS rogue unit. Cannot rely on their reporting g 
2:13:18,2:16:11, @Elvis Malakoane indeed sir. 😷 I suspect the Goat is back in some other form...watch this space Bushiri time traveled into 2020 at the beginning of the year n said it was gonna b a great year🥴🤕🤒 Sandile July is very explicitly. You may offcourse choose to misunderstand him for your personal or commercial reasons July sounds like he is telling a whole movie with those emotions @Leon Mbangwa how is explicitly? "What i clearly understand is that Leon it is so disgusting when you listen pros an legal minds not mking logic in this platform. The deletion of the information on the report of 18 March 2018 is the problem and not the number of reports. 
2:17:31,2:23:25, @Carl Botha you are correct This guy is a conspiracy theorist But but he said he wasn't a conspiracy theorist...😇 Lots of hearsay "He once said"" ""I hope this hearing is not going to be controlled by people who happen to be controlled by the complainants who tell the NPA how to run the hearing "Leon from the noise above ...Each report was signed by someone in particular out of the blue.. July withdraws his statements smone out of the green black and gold🤥 
2:23:39,2:27:41, I'm failing to know how Adv. Obama can follow July. I can't understand what he is saying. Maybe it is my ADHD messing around yes DCJ get to the crux There is what is called Retalin...for those who have difficulty in understanding Mr July That’s it DCJ. You are not the ccma Why can't they say that an interim report is an incompleate or unfinished report. Does it take 15 minutes to say that? Incomplete!! Kenny D @ You must listen attentively as well and stop being blinded by your loyalty to the man. "Let me help ...July wish to dictate a society to their liking. 
2:27:56,2:33:45, "Just nice to watch the movie. mans heard a crime "What an own goal for McBride. He got away without explaining his actions that resulted in murderers not being held accountable contrary to IPIDs mandate.He goes to state capture @Gugulethu Xhosans Oh now I have loyalty. I wonder where my loyalty is. Where is my loyalty? Subsequent to answering the question please tell us what statement did July withdraw. ...Perjury is the result for following others instructions. who is this guy?

2:45:08,2:49:04, Please get Kate to deal withthis gentleman "Melvict it would make sense The fire pool minister should have given witness for half a day. He ended up telling fairy tales for 3 plus days! It is no wonder that this commission has cost in excess of R 750 million. also advertising to make sure that Werksmans get more guvvament work? The report was changed and he died....so sorry for his family Why don't they get the stuff and look fr themsleves? Is this witness for or against Nhleko? This evidence leader has so far not done a great job. He seems to be a bit disorganized? He wasted a lot of time because his filing work was a mess. He needs to up his game. "I'm a bit lost 
2:49:06,2:54:36, He died soon after the issues of two reports became hot. what?! hi "Starting this morning what's happening on the camera... the blue lights are disturbing Really in this time of our democracy we can never allow the breach of so many laws and the perpetrators feed us lies and get away. sanitize the report 😂😂😂😂 @Stronger together ......True...that's why the ANC Bra's are all brainwashed etc etc..... "...Defeating the ends of Justice is the loss of a true identity for Justice 
2:54:52,2:59:32, Perpetrators do not only give us lies but they get promoted to very sen positions in government. Now the DCJ is getting to the crux of the matter. "I am proud of Dramat. He resigned and if it wasn't for those crooks who decided to sanitize their lies through the Commission "I don’t get this guy at all Hi one and all.
