Is it a question of every job looks like a nail if all you have is a hammer? Valencia eina!!! "pffffffff😤 new evidence leader?? I didn't get the evidence leader's name but the two of them have a long way to go before they perfect the looting subject like Jacob "Cassim suleman eff will humble more people more white who don't like julius .for that people will vote them in power .

They have to build a new furnace overtime that happens supplier development That is circular logic @SanFran Arnold 
27:26,28:32, in prison u have to work ur self to be the senior looter "@Phil because you listen to dictators noise makers i think maybe i shud call the eff in our little town to help with my problem or because eff is talking about land ? but one way or we have to go there and talk about it .forthe sake of are children not so it will stay a pain ....... We eating the elephant piece by piece @Blake Yogi Exactly... I'm reading these comments thinking why would people assume this and that just by appearance?? @Hosia. Yass @SanFran Arnold Circular logic again. The same applies to a host of industrry. You argue as if smelting is the only industry that cannot deal with load shedding. "I am not asking you this 
28:37,29:32, dave reddy changed his name to dave brownie still waters run deep. Bester will open new files and bring new names for Hawks it's not me thanks Blake tjooo she is killing me softly with that voice.

No 1......yah neh ''Sent by number 1''😂 Some guy 🤣🤣🤣 
30:10,30:47, You can figure out who is no. 1:elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: I have plastic injection moulding customerss for whom load shedding is devastating. the plastic dries in the mould and it is a massive time consuming clean up operation. Number 1! No 1 mmm No1 Jakobus who is No1😂 "@Aubrey De Bliquy smelters are one industry that needs a constant supply. Once the power goes off and the ore solidifies @Blake Yogi Lol... just shaking my head... zuma is no 1 
30:50,31:17, "this is wrong. that's all classified information!!! shouldn't given to the public 😂🤣😂 "No.1 Ask him who does he thinks who is #1. Always no.1 "The farming land was paid for and is now bonded with the Banks Zuma is number 1 LOOTER zuma could not have been number 2 to anyone else boet "who remembers Brian koalane from Waterkloof... Gupta landed with the instructions from ""number 1""" 
31:26,31:49, the blesser i won't mind if Advocate Afro can be my No 1 @madzi ? They were many number they should hve atleast mentioned their numbers also Valencia J don't even go there because black people arw the only ones in real poverty!!! And when i say poverty i mean it. Black people get all the attention because the other colours have it better "@Big Daddy @Madzi yess!!😂😂 liability yooo india???? 
31:53,32:21, julius is not going anywere if hes touching nervs then let it b till we face the truth. the problem between us and white is truth about the economi and land . @sam all of this is in their public space. is it me or the advocate resembles Criselda Kananda Number 2 is Dudu Myeni I am also number 1. It means nothing without a name. Akhonamandla stop it you are trespassing India Captured us @SanFran Arnold All that may be true without it detracting from my point. The manganese is going to ultimately be smelted. Avoiding solving the problem does not detract from my point. Ncoooh....Number 1......He was a very involved man shame....sort of like a very hands-on president😀😀😀🤣🤣🤣 
32:30,33:22, Malema is a fool @madzi Kuse Was he not appointed after that as an Ambassador somewhere? Bayampimpa abelungu South Africa was gone....had Zuma finished his second term fools see fools If you are number one you get to ride the Gupta plane 🤣🤣 Mfanafuthi Gama me and you😄 @Sithembiso Nyawo Hands on everything corrupt! Fools keep company with fools 
33:23,34:37, big daddy mxm as for having it better. you clearly live under a rock. Anyway that's it for today. I don't have energy for you today @Aubrey De Bliquy your point makes it impossible for smelters to survive in SA. You would need to first sort out power before smelting can be done "Number 1 is so smart. The only evidence against him is talk from witnesses @Mzalwane......awubayeke...sifunukwazi...:Lol @Andy 😂 don't be selfish chief "seriously Yuu Precious Ntshangase some people don't agree with that opinion "Valencia you're confusing things and blowing hot air when we all know that most of thise farmers are racist and tell thier black employers hold thier own signs "" Boer's lives matter""" "JZ 
34:49,35:33, julius s name is in the mouth of lot people ask your self y ?😂😂 in braai in shabin bars offices and in coridoor y y y ????? land is the problem . @Blake Yogi yes Number 1 had almost taken over the whole country @Val Speirs Yes he is. I also thought the same of Eugene Terrablanche who behaved no better than Julius. In public hated blacks but was ok to have sexual relationships with black boys. What a disgrace "@Mfanafuthi Gama 1 is just a number. Evergreen contracts must be abolished. We cant have people that milk SOEs forever. And you depend on Boer food to feed yourself and family "@Cerebis yeah he was ...if you remember that lady who is the minister of women  @blake ..no 1 poor in writing..as he left early from school @SanFran Arnold You make no sense. i am advocating for solving the real problem in favour of smelting and the best economic interests of South Africa. I have no dog in this fight. What's yours? 
35:39,36:37, n "@Lebohang Mofokeng I know @Shumi Ngwenya I am number -1. I am better that number 1.

2:52:40,2:53:43, "Eish guys let us try to see where the power was coming from. Pastor JJ is back lol . Welcome baack i think this should be a department or a government sector of its own..legal review task teams...if our ceos sign docs without reading and companies invoice without any work done because Essa says so Yes.... Mr Bester is giving his Best Balloon the project budgets "Quick question who was behind all this power guys it boggles my mind! I am only interested in arrests people must be brought to book 
2:53:44,2:55:01, """I didn't say he was an idiot""😝😝😝" Jakobus here clearly had beef with these Indians... Mr Bester said Essa told him in 2014 that Molefe was going to Eskom. Molefe became CEO in April 2015 @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee I was always here. Just quietly ignoring most of the nonsense if you know what I mean. bester u are doing well he doesnt like curry @Singi Mathebula you don't have the right to mislead people on a such a sensitive matter by spewing nonsense!!! @hirsitus Lol LOL 
2:55:01,2:55:47, """Salim Essa is a criminal mastermind South African businessman...."" I just googled Salim Essa 🤣😂🤣" I think the proceedings are going well and are illuminating.

I am tired of this corruption! @Nyilika this are technocrats and highly professional Bester is telling the truth...He very wisely deposed to an affidavit about this meeting immediately @abc I am a man maybe if he is gay "@Cerebis 
2:57:36,2:58:26, "Chair imagine sitting there knowing that you did the right thing @12 40 thanks Is obviously not paying attention @Linda Ncapai 🤢🤮 never mind... "@Allen Mohlala They were smart. They new something was brewing and they knew they had to protect themself... knew @abc 😂😂😂😂😂
