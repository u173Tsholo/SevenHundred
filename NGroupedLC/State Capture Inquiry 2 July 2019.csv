But then I wouldn't be too motivated if I wasn't getting paid. shama lama lama ding dong Guys you know the SABC is broke so everything has to be slow @Lucky Nxumalo ..... yes is a Zulu.... but before that he is a thief I think they're using a translator - the lips and sound don't correlate Martin's looks like the Grim Reaper today. Why? @Kevin Allister Simon 😂😂 the Adv looks scary 😂😂

"@ Thando Nkutha I tend to love the former minister Ben Martin The Guptas think they are still a dynasty.. red carpet treatment etc. What a joke. 
32:44,34:30, Tarmac meetings seem to become normal??? Guptas are Zuma s president ..... He was Deputy Minister of Public Enterprises during the rot @yose hey braaaah don't include me "Ben Martin is born again Christian tenders must fall The criminal Gupta Dynasty and Zumas comrades of corruption. "ag these hackers irritate Gupta s we're running the country .... 
35:12,36:56, "@makhosi nobhatyi ""Born again Christian"" means nothing. Zuma is a lay preacher and look at what he did." Sure thing @Thando Nkutha Ben Martins sounding overly defensive "I saw nothing untoward stop tribalism please Yusuf @Thando Nkutha thanks Flimsy argument sir "I know words but this guy .. he's asked 1 simple question n he's boringly reading his defencive statement .. please stop him commissioner .. 
37:04,38:28, He does not deviate from his lawyers script..literally @Mduduzi Thabede then it'd be difficult but then it's a difficult job... @Mduduzi Thabede Indeed - his attitude towards them facilitated their corruption. @yose his annoying with his tribalism sies @Zolani Hoza it's his chance to defend himself... ".. he doesn't Not really @LYD @Mduduzi Thabede I get you brother... .. who said he's been attacked and there's a reason to defend himself .. 
38:38,41:01, we only need clarity here .. LUCKY MONTANA's name again! Using the tribalism wedge was an apartheid strategy. Pleading ignorance n naivety 🤷🏿‍♂️ “Projected to be...” I can’t believe what I’m hearing @Thando Nkutha i agree he is lying already @goolamv TRUE! "This Ben Martins ".. look at how this leading to now 
41:29,43:51, @Zolani Hoza the evidence leader not so bad... The DCJ... @x. .x correct. Adv Thandi speaks with that confidential voice Zuma didnt use the guptas the guptas used him come on guys The whole minister with a law degree could see that the guptas had no grounds for litigation But she’s being interrupted @Derick Mampuru I don't think Adv Thandi takes nonsense from anyone. True 
44:23,45:48, Magashule's days are numbered "Zuma used the Guptas liar @Thando Nkutha Adv Thandi Norman Martins is a bit defensive and nervous @x. .x And look at where he is now Pleasure @Thando Nkutha We must as citizens if this country.. Declare War On Corruption. ".. he's gonna lose it
