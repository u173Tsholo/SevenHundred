time,2:46,message @SABC Digital News Isn't the afternoon session scheduled to start at 14h30? @SABC Digital News Thank you 😃 and then? Well said Madam why is she apologising? its getting heated in here Is he trying to do a JZ trick here? For the prejudiced line of Questioning @Thulani Bukani 
7:59,15:22, "Retaliation from him "Mr Thabete""s behaviour has become very familiar of a witness we had 2 weeks ago that created a drought in Parktown" "Hmmm Yes Anne how can the questions be prejudice when he's been charged? That was drafted at Saxon world Yes it's lies it's lies 
16:10,20:00, This one looks like he was dribbled. He doesnt look like he is corrupt. This is like pulling teeth without anaesthetic. If that is the case then he is really stupid!!! "he was just a tool long unending journey he always need to be reminded of the questions JZ did the same Either corrupt or totally negligent and incompetent. "@Dominic Przybylski Al 
20:33,22:48, "poor mr thabethe is embarrasing himself in front of his children And instructed by somebody more senior than him "@brenda maluka Yes @Anne M. It seems that they are all singing from the same hymn sheet he must go to jail This man is shielding Bullet and punches for Ace Magashule I can’t believe why he did this "Probably has $millions in Dubai bank account Maleka is always in court. I think he left the commission. umm 
22:51,26:29, @Pastor J Yes. Thankfully the DCJ is a very intelligent man. "@Anne yes u are right @Anne M. they paid him...thats why his on pension its a easy buck...send this man to jail he faild SA and people They milked S.A. dry he got money to take the rap justice must take its cause pastor or the not GO STRAIGHT TO JAIL. DO NOT PASS BEGIN. DO NOT COLLECT R200. Did I say it right? @Raven Penny U are very right. 
28:51,33:07, How do they verify beneficiaries? What would stop Ramaposa from getting on the list to get his buffaloes milked for free. I doubt if there is something helpful that will come out of his testimony. Did all of these things mentioned by mr Thabethe ever happened people? Those who stay there assist we are dealing with paperwork now I don’t think there was if it was happened for 6 months as I see Somebody drove around with a loudhailer inviting anyone who wants to be a beneficiary. they don't t worry about family when they do this things what a shame when is the npa going to start acting.these rogues sho.uld be in jail Sooner rather than later we hope!!! agreed Why should Estina register a company for beneficiaries? 
33:40,37:32, To cover up their wrong deeds!!! whoes goig to Makhosi Nobhatyi it looks like the only thing that ever happened was to give the Guptas millions of rands. Yep !! Considering they had a R17million plan they don't seem to have followed any plan (except the Gupta one). please npa act now to long this has been going on @ Yolo More that’s what is how I see if there was little thing happened and channel all the money to Guptas what happened to the extrdition order.npa kessa still waiting 
37:58,39:57, Yho! Not yet completed. heiiiii Wacha mokhukhu waiting for the new dawn ahaaa....who were the directors of zhainer? they the guptas knew but this big people was greedy They whole medical industry is about to be nationalised. Land is about to be nationalised. Soon we will have no alternative to corruption. that was a ghost co And the Guptas just spent another R400million on another wedding. By the time the NPA starts to get active we will be lucky to even get R4.00 back We will get nothing back. 
40:18,42:03, Not even R4.00 ? hahahaha Zuko Nodada he does not give the names. "Worse than not getting anything back beneficiaries have not ever seen a cent!! but they should bring back what belongs to our country We got nothing back from the sale of all our oil reserves for $20 a barrel. hennce i say start the arrest and take their assets hi hi 
42:15,45:55, you sign the 2nd agreement even though it doesnt protect the state...this is strange. How can u sign the contract we outthought beneficairys When is this guy finished his testimony? "I want to see the R17million plan @Petrus Mahlangu Stealing from the poor - the Guptas had/have no conscience @Anne M. Neither does our government. "this rogue thinks we all stupid 😀 Is this man 60 years already or it was an early retirement? 
46:06,47:45, i know justice will prevail 😃😃😂😂😂 Batohi is working on something here no doubt @Yolo More I think he was in his late 50s when he retired @Yolo More Who cares. Just happy to be rid of this skelm early retirement Ja Anne M. he looks young. there he says R30m is not a lot of money...Mmhhh!..because it was not his money. 30m "how can this man laugh...... he's a joke 
48:06,50:16, Pastor J hahaha 30 million was for the wedding 30 m is not a lot. wottalotigot. He was suspended in the process the contract came to an end and it was not renewed then he retired @Lorraine Naidoo Can u imagine what an indian would do with a R30M wedding? @Zuko Nodada spot on. That's what happens when a government takes tax. It did not struggle to make it so it doesn't care if it wastes it. Hope Zondo can see what is happening in gov. junior lawyer lol Pastor I would of got married 10 x 
50:52,51:44, I am consulting consulting costs loads of money lol lol 30 million he says not lot of money because he has a lot in that underground vault in nk. stupid has no limit clearly😂 @Lorraine Naidoo Noooooo. My wedding cost me R725.00 .41 379.31 weddings for me.hahahahaha He consulted the Guptas would of build so.many rdp houses for the poor 
52:03,54:05, This man took no responsibility. Somebody must have been paying him to look the other way. the older ones would never do it "Liked what Zondo said yesterday These Man must be arrested immediately after completion of his testimony 22 @Raymond Raymond He was also arrested by Hawks along with 6 Gupta cronies. Liz Profe and a brown envelope as well Gross negligence personified 22 
54:16,55:08, Was a case not dropped against this guy? 22 99 i fully agree as we all watch SA heading to collapse "If he was smart and he had a masters degree in agriculture!!!!@ This man's casual neglect is highly suspicious. Either he is lying or he is totally reckless. Pastor I got married with one months salary R250. my late husband earned that at Makro. he was shipping manager 
55:09,58:12, "A new business venture "@Bonang Sithole He was arrested by the Hawks last year with 6 others and was given R10 Zondo is trapping you don't agree to the word wrong @Lorraine Naidoo . I believe you. who employed this v we deviate everyday The practice of looking the other way. now is explains a lot of rubbish again they should call for the bank statements of these people....there will be big surprises there no doubt 
58:14,1:03:47, deviate to be a tool no way why? Pastor apartheid time no jobs .I worked for Indians for R90 a month we were exploited by our Indian community. Mpumalanga "I am not waking up early tomorrow @Lorraine Naidoo That is so sad. When I started working I was paid R125 for 6 days of work. It was really hard but also very painful when we were exploited. make sure utilize this funding to the right places... "Apartheid time I was forced into military service how’s this ugly man? @Dominic Przybylski U are absolutely right. My late dad went thru the same 
1:03:55,1:05:40, Some of those who comment here don't know that Thabethe was arrested and charged for Estina last year. This man speaks like Hlaudi. its running deep there's stil more to come they wil get their chips in those days our parents lived in poverty but were very HAPPY ...A Society of Educated Money Managers..is governance by thieves and cohorts and sly persons for portions of the loot..is a corporate education system for the wealthy. "How easy it was @Smart Guys Oh yes since this commission was formed how many thiefs where arrested up to so far? Agrizzi 
1:05:51,1:07:30, none "Mzalwana mzala sentenced for how long? nobody is going to jail. In this country we are having our personal money stolen from us every day. They call it tax. Agree According to your research didn’t you recover these problems then? it's so unfair Estina were sole beneficiary. 
1:07:35,1:11:00, "He speaks but Estina had one director and no employees. Cheaper 30M not a lot of cash? Creaper watch out for the pause Aw man pause please this is not a pulpit. At a squeeze you could have a weeding for 30M if that answers your question @Remember Dzhombe 
1:11:57,1:15:49, This guy shows everything wrong with govt doing things for on behalf of the people. Govt (or rather the people who work for govt) assume that the people are incapable of decision making. "He faced charges of fraud @Mzalwane Mzala Thanks for the info. "So Mzala And the charges were dropped Mzala? more charges coming................... "@barbara broadbent Why books? I like books. But I have a few spare hammers The NPA provisionally dropped the charges in November 2018. 😀😀😀😀 
1:15:56,1:17:46, eish answer the question dont tell us what we already now Provisionally the magic word!! who's us gupta this guy was the main person used to loot this money..given his position....and he also benefited from this....now he has to give all this suspicious evidence to protect we know who. The Public Protector made adverse findings against him. "@Lorraine Naidoo Maybe we should throw some chilli powder on this uncle""s face" Pastor I will provide sub contraceptives Reallt? Did somebody from SA have to go all the way to India to find expertise to do fiary farming in SA?. This is fraud & corruption par excellence. 
1:18:05,1:20:35, @Lorraine Naidoo Which brand u got? This uncle is proud to hive evidence No this man now throwing beneficiaries into a failing of a project Gupta chillies hahahaha look at he's nose getting longer @Lorraine Naidoo We should get some of that Mother in laws tongue stuff Pastor you know that one it's lekker Blerry hot stuff that 
1:20:50,1:22:51, Pastor you from Durban "always passing the blame to somebody else Aren't you glad your not here anymore?? These things raise serious questions about what government employees who are paid huge salaries really do? May be the DJC must recommend in his report that govt employees must do real work. I'm from the beautiful town Nelspruit. lovely place hi He lost his job due to the public protector report that said nothing about politicians. new video. come and see! 
1:23:34,1:26:03, the present PP? Division of Revenue Act (DORA) shem this uncle is telling the all the stories .but no.mention of Ace Nobody cares about how well they spend their money as much as the person who earned it. That's why capitalism survives and socialism fails. You must be a lawyer Mzala? @barbara broadbent The present PP my son in law us a pastor there @Lorraine Naidoo Whats his name Lorraine I believe Estina report has been set aside due to failure on review. 
1:26:04,1:29:07, Tell me is this state capture continued tomorrow Ralph Pillay I dont know him @Lorraine Naidoo adjourns for tea lunch and weekends. we are in deep trouble let's stand together this is the tip of the iceberg One of the Vrede Farm whistle blowers was murdered in October last year. The PP report was successfully challenged in court for failing to investigate politicians and focusing only on officials. It would be interesting to see whether he can claim his job back based on the setting aside of the PP report. "...Appointing service providers to replace the necessity to employ government technicians 
1:29:19,1:33:17, there are big things thats still coming @Mzalwane Mzala Was the Hawks arrest done on instruction of the PP or independantly? They were charged based on Hawks investigations. "This government appoints agents and contractors to do the real work @goolamv If I recall correctly at the beginning he said he was suspended without pay based on the PP report and when he heard nothing after that he asked for his pension. Yes they did .I saw on tv a long time ago. i fully agree Those Farmers are crying for there loved ones that they murdered pension 
1:33:34,1:37:06, ...The project is diverting public funds to specific shell companies which is malfeasance. he was pension off with millions hiiiii yes keep him in the hotseat yes Lorraine "Hahaha Raven He is very smart it was the Guptas Very smart

1:44:26,1:46:39, I agree ...This guy covering for the service provider to which the money was transferred. Compliance for the benefit of the citizens is no legally required and salaries are paid to people with pockets. same here Yolo He is scared. paid in full to retire @david cele Wassup No1 Hunter? this commission has exposed the quality of people we have in the public.Grown ups sucking to power to a point were they're willing to compromise themselves i agree Lorraine sharp bro I thought environmental impact asessment was paid for in the R17 million plan. 
1:46:55,1:49:12, @Lorraine Naidoo that' is been smart sandela agree HOD Peter Thabethe is the most competent administrator I know. and it is so sad that our people want to be so used @Mfanafuthi Gama Then how did he allow the Guptas to rip off so much money? go home....sorry jail is he still Gama ? @Mfanafuthi Gama How many administrators do you know? from which province is this witness? 
1:49:13,1:50:16, He is retired now. I wouldn't know. @Mfanafuthi Gama he has not the blamed anyone. The level of accountability is high here Did he still remember ethics of his office @Wilson Hishono Free State ก้าวเเรกไม่เป็นไร ก้าวต่อไปไฟไหม้สบง tsela. that's leadership.

Someone threw him under the bus "Only register them once all the money has been looted Rad fully agree he has already spilled some of "Rad NEVER at least hes honest @Mfanafuthi Gama The issue is that he thinks the bare minimum is sufficient instead of asking the necessary hard questions before spending millions of taxpayer money. he's lying done means finshed in english preliminary 
1:54:25,1:56:06, Derek he is elaborate according to me. where he deosnt know he says so. hence I ask. what's the gap? finished It looks like he feels that tie getting tighter. he is trying hard to hide she is properly trained liar @Mfanafuthi Gama You obviously haven't been listening to all of his testimony. DCJ Zondo went on at length asking why he didn't find out more about Estina before partnering with them. He said he didn't think it was necessary. spil the beans stop your lies my brother
