Mr Xis being interrogated and the other lady is the interpreter Mr X more comfortable in Zulu for clarity Whos Mr Majola Mr X by the sound of his voice sound like that old man was here before. Wavele waphahluka uZondo😂😅; Mr X - bathi uMajola😅 
20:39,26:27, "Out of sheer ignorance @Denise Lakey...he fears for his life...he was threatened umntu usebenza nomntwana wakho tjoooooooooo "com on now "They know If this guy gets cross examined he will be swallowed up and will have zero credability. "@Denise Lakey It is the community members he's scared of. If they were to see him giving testimony dude and Majola can send pics "He said people involved will know him 
28:29,33:22, morning amigos! morning amigas👋🙏🤝 Orkay😦 Mr X did make money from all this through the interest he'd earn in the money market account l. Morning my learned friends "Mr X is not innocent all Right amen indeed @Pheladi Lamola that mean that Banks are corruption enablers...they must be held accountable 
33:36,35:30, i think Mr X is our second Agrizzi true hence now they w s nt to start a state bank too did mrx drop any names yet? "want """ "Mr X does not need an interpretor. This is a farce. Make no mistake yup You're absolutely right @mxolisi buthelezi. I've been asking myself why they didn't notice the movement of monies that big. he has a right to an interpreter regardless if he needs on or not 
35:42,38:51, cuz they got a cut "yes "Judge does a better job at interpreting "agreed  "If ppl r irritated that he uses an interpretor etc "@Rory Lee Farnham yes he did make money lol LOL lol 
39:05,45:08, agreed LOL "@Tholithemba Ntsele he madoda I wonder if he needs the word MONEY interpreted Do you want the job @Tholithemba Ntsele ? "Water boards r mostly corrupt. ppl hav no water The ppl who stole the money and bankrupted UGU are known. politically connected MM and d company who paid for the ANC bday bash in Port Shepstone.connect d dots Mr X YOU ARE TOO MUCH JONK "Tholi 
45:17,48:13, She still sounds tons better(flcomfortable) than the Afrikaans interpreter for Basson(state capture inquiry) and even the other guy at Neil Agetts inquiry "@Tholithemba "The water truck companies and guys selling water tanks are minting it So even amaZulu are 'discriminating' against their own. Uyabona nje i-tribalism is dangerous... "water is flowing into the sea while daily "Mr X hisself did infact indicate that he understands english well but felt more comfortable speaking zulu to properly describe the events that took place. This fuss about ""joburg zulu"" is unnecessary" @Tholithemba Ntsele You mean morphed Zulu. A Zulu prevalent amongst urban/ younger blacks. The same has happened to afrikaans. Even English... kodwa qhubekani "Someone once said 
48:28,51:13, lol Mr X knows English @ Tholithemba true Alex issue should also be opened but i ges the scope for commission had its targeted people in mind Zulu privilege @Sthakathi Khumalo hahahahaha you're funny. I agree @Mxolisi Buthelezi you have completely missed the point. It’s been explained very clearly. "@Eliot Chauke yes he does Page - ikhasi I think.. interpreter udlala ngathi😂😂😂 the sabc ppl looking at these comments should pass our leads onto the commission 
51:55,53:00, "@Gee Peex1 he did "@Mabutho Mabaso trust me I get it. What you don't get is that languge/culture is not static. With urbanization @Gee Peex1 ...The Commissions Lawyers. @Musa he wants to turn around and say i was miss quoted....Isizulu vs English Where is Mr Majo;la????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? @Gee Peex1 Mr X stated he can read and write English. He prefers to speak in his mother tongue while giving evidence. @Mtokozisi Baleni then he chairperson of the commission and courts will decide @Mbuso Ndlovu he's the next witness Isnt he supposed to testify next? 
53:06,55:08, hoo @Musa Mabunda We can't wait to hear his side of the story😀😁😂😂😁😀 @Tholithemba Ntsele fair enough... @Gee Peex1 ...It is perfectly legal. But in a Court of Law it needs to be Qualified to ensure that the Interpretation was done correctly. Mr Majola will testify today "Apparently chair slipped and called Mr X - Majola @Gee Peex1 I'm not sure what you mean? @Musa the chair understand and speaks original zulu not this Jo'burg mixture these numbers are killing our interpreter😁 
55:38,57:23, "Dudu is the crime boss @Zibuyile Luthuli Majola will probably not remember much like Mr Myeni😀😁😂 "Zuma was Dudus boss @Sthakathi Majola is the key/star witness "Gupta was Zuma boss @Gee Peex1 I have no idea Why don't they show us Ms interpreter today instead of that empty chair? "Gee Peex1 🤣🤣🤣🤣 the money part 
57:57,1:01:04, @Pheladi Lamola Maybe the interpreter saw the nasty comments about her hair yesterday and asked not to be filed. *filmed "I don't think many of u are really following the evidence @Pheladi am sure the hairstyle sold her out or camera pressure mamela isivuno trading tjoooooooooo Yeah people can be nasty to others sometimes. @ Jabu easy to follow its money laundering and corruption "it is clear that this witness ngubani Loma Jola?????🤔 
1:02:21,1:05:03, "If Mr Majola is listening to this he'll just say I never gave such instructions Earlier on uZondo uphahlukile wambiza ngoMajola - manje ngididekile ukuthi ubani lomunye uMajola😩 "@Mxolisi Buthelezi reads like you agree @Pheladi Lamola then the chair will make his findings "Pheladi khuluma English "Delinquient director..dudu was running SAA hey hey hey "Carte Blanche Koko. ""lets just say it was a mistake 
1:05:27,1:09:12, Angazi it looks like Majola is a Big crook he did sign anything or wrote any email. he would come in in person an issue instructions. He knows what he was doing Africans will be concerned about an interpreter speaking diluted Zulu and not millions of Rands looted by the ANC kleptocrats who you keep returning to power. "@Mtokozisi Baleni Yes "u can giv our politicians another 30 years @isaac mutasa we can attack more than 1 issue at the same time. Don’t involve us in your inability to multitask. That does ring a bell @Anne M. Many bells actually By the time Mr X evidence concludes - uzogcina ekhuluma isingisi😂😂😂 @Isaac Isizulu is a major language we have a right to be concerned if its not interpreted correctly Sir 
1:09:13,1:10:40, @Mabutho Mabaso its true though yup me too Group of thugs. They should be locked up. Poor people are suffering because of this rampant corruption these people just cant do numbers thats why the country is a mess @Pastor J 😀 The modus operandi of skelms doesn't differ too much. @Sibusiso Hadebe ....Indeed very very true true anya Anne.M spot on with the Gavin comparison!! Unfortunately yes @Anne M. ...Birds of a feather comes to mind 
1:10:44,1:13:53, hear hear u soo correct we need another interpreter to see if she is translating correctly @Isaac Mutasa on the dot Same as Bosasa. This is Agrissi no 2 "true Mr Majola hey banna? It may not matter much Can anyone tell me what is going to happen to all these crooks @Daniel Prinsloo nothing "I respect and appreciate that this man @Sthakathi lets hope the End wont be the same like poor Gavin Watson @anya - who is paying for this commission 
1:14:21,1:14:50, "One Zulu gone against the chiefs Your secretary may have just saved you there Mr X. @Daniel Prinsloo the taxpayer bathroom time mr X "impressed by the translation lol zulu a major language @Daniel Prinsloo You and Me and the rest of poor people Haaaa Mt X Mr 
1:14:59,1:17:34, He wants a break😂😂 what time are they resuming 11:15 @Mbuso Ndlovu no its the taxpayer not the poor Correction 11:15 "@Thandile Nkoyi and he wants it now "Is Mr X a majola also "@Musa Mabunda its getting a little hotter in there Very Brave Witness 
1:18:00,1:31:42, "@Sthakathi Khumalo  Inkulu indaba phakathi kuka Majola no Secretary.Kuyoqhuma nhlavana ezinye ziyakufekela! "Mboniseni Majola I want to see this Mr Majola what would be his evidence in all this. Our our country is a mess someone will be in jail thats for certain. wish all commissions are contacted this way. Monthlante falls way below this standard. Well done. You have a feeling people are given a chance to speak up N defend themselves. I smell IJELE kodwa "And the Nkandla crooner is apparently in Cuba getting medical attention "Thibedi Shai I feel you @Sthakathi Khumalo what I don't understand is a witness asking 4 his identity not 2 be made public but his entity name is made public. Is it the identity of the person that their hiding or his face? 
1:35:21,1:42:16, BANKSTERS have given you their MARK called CITIZEN-SHIP through which you may buy and sell. It's the BIRTH CERTIFICATE LEGAL NAME "@Truth Is don't be ridiculous Judge Zondo is sharp today! @Eugene Trollip he is VERY on-the-ball. Thibedi Shai I am sure its to try and protect him from new request to take him out - but ya the entity part is just an miss too I'm watching the Commission from my office at Imithetho Labour Law T/A Labour Law Distributors in Boksburg Now SABC decides to show us an empty chair - thixo I'm Enjoying this Proceedings from my office at Imithetho Labour Law T/A Labour Law Distributors ⚖ in Boksburg Its difficult but something must effort must be done to try and protect identities of such witnesses. Its difficult though! 
1:42:39,1:45:46, You don't know how to appreciate. That is a very expensive Bosch mike. R50K for the purchase and set-up :P:P (and yes that's sarcasm * with a hint of concern) "Agreed "Edward hi Judge Zondo's sense of humour 👌😃😃 @ Jabu yes and spend a few millions . Transport etc Jail the crooks and he will be ok! any little protection baba Mhmmm wow proceeds going hot ppl? I just get in now 
1:45:53,1:49:59, Judge Zondo flirting with the interpreter kkkkkk Poor daughter kodwa Kate Hofmeyer is the reason why Zondo will apply for another extension the banks must account I hope the banks are held accountable. They enabled too much. The same banks who have been involved in scandals - some have even admitted to manipulating currency. @Sthakathi Khumalo they should not be allowed to trade currencies. It causes instability all over the world. surely some movements of these monies must have raised suspicion Why cant we see the intepreter? 
1:50:02,1:52:38, was the gentleman thats testifying working at any entity Banks all guilty 💰💸 Difficult to implicate banks. Ungalandi imali yakho at most times the bank will give it to you. How ever most banks are complicit in shoddy deals. Shame "Money has no morals or ethics If I transfer R2000 the bank is on my case right away. How come it did not happen for all these deals? why do you insist on seeing the interpreter. Such cases need very professional people who have to be protected. "@See Earth wrong people have no morals or ethics I want to see the interpreter "Interesting that in isiZulu (and in isiXhosa) the word to ""confirm"" also means to ""tighten"" something." 
1:52:38,1:53:55, @sea earth Seems your not trustworthy "@anya van loggerenberg I am not talking about money as an individual "@clive oconnell according to teh banks yesterday they were showing us the interpreter Hey hey @Roza essack He owns his own company which had dealings with Mhlathuze Water "money does nothing to people 😎 @See Earth indeed they also need t b investigated 
1:53:56,1:55:26, Majola ibosso! "Bogus legal team @Abel Matshidiso 100% agree anne so he cant spk english just asking Hey "Anya No bogus commission here this is serious. This is corruption! "@Roza essack Yes he speaks English oh ok 
1:55:46,1:56:59, Tea and gossip commission Money is a store of social power. People do things for money. @Roza essack in times of stress it is easier to respond in home language "guys "@Henrique Botha it's fine being cynical Umbhoshongo - now thats a word right there!! "If he understands English people are corrupt...not money @Granny Mokwena indeed! We should have had so much done if it wasn't stolen 
1:57:11,1:58:07, "millions and millions of taxpayers money given to people who have done nothing @See Earth. There is a very fine line between being hopeful and naive... "Someone once said if you steal in English people are corrupt @Denise Lakey making sure he understands everything Can I also get that money for doin nothing and get a tender too? please maybe some people will understand the looting that has taken place All this stoken money could have benefited many mam "@FieliesSA true 
1:58:11,1:59:30, lorna for sure me too please and still don't know where it came from @See Earth Hope is based on honesty. The only person most likely to be honest with you is yourself. That's why it is so important to recognise individual over the collective. "please Ma Dudu please.. all these dudus.. dudu myeni  "We need TRC 2.0 @Jabu Malunga you'll have to be connected to people in high places to get such tenders where you get millions for doing nothing. so if he is arrested then will his rights also be read to him in zulu Dont start with apartheid - please De Klerk owes the whole nation an apology and repentance program @Dominic Przybylski hope is what we have when things like this commission are created. Hope that the right thing will be done. It is the candle in the dark. 
2:00:16,2:01:52, @Sthakathi Khumalo agreed. His stupid comments have caused serious issues and he owes us all a very heartfelt apology. Zuma faction are you still saying utata has nothing wrong he did? They should all go and doedoe (sleep) and leave our children to manage SOE's @See Earth This commission shows how little of the right thing is done. It confirms the lack of light at the end of the tunnel. This is just the tip of the iceberg. IS the any real thing or money by Mr Majola accounting for wok done yhooo imali ezingaka phooo zipuma ngendlela mnyama ... i cant wait to hear what he has to say for him self ... hay betuna!! @See Earth Rather be cautiously optimistic. The poorest of the poor are starving...hospitals are inadequately supplied with staff & medicine while millions are paid for doing nothing "@Dominic Przybylski you have to admit though that if it wasn't for this commission The group of people committing treason in the name of apartheid bosses must be hanged. 
2:01:53,2:03:38, "If SARS is on top of their game yoh how much money did this majola guy spend Mr Majola = if corruption was a person @See Earth and what are we going to do with what we know now? Prosecute a handful of people and replace them with a new crowd of political criminals? We need more accountability. that's what would really create optimism. most of the money apparently was going to dudu myeni and the zuma foundation @peet venter lol not true qinisekisa is confirm qinisa is tighten @makhosi Nobhatyi.they will never agree . @Dominic Przybylski THAT is the million dollar question. We will have to wait and see 
2:03:39,2:04:44, "@See Earth Not true. Those of us who knew "@FieliesSA that's different Carl no the Zuma Foundation is a front for laundering looted public money "ANC is detached from the masses he was sooooooo used @See Earth There is no cure possible without a complete change of social culture. amen "Evidence so far is that MrX was the conduit and Mr Majola was the postman/messenger for Dudu who then reported to big boss a.k.a No1. And that is not the Prisoner no 
2:04:52,2:06:22, Carl niehaus economic revolution looters "@Dominic Przybylski again why dont the people occupy these looters land nd houses @See Earth We live in a country where meritocracy is a dirty word. all these huge cash withdrawals .....banks failed to raise a red flag.....banks were part of state capture banks were given a cut if this is economic revolution then we are doomed his money nd he spend it lekker without considering his poor people @Dominic Przybylski there is a groundswell that has been created through the information that is coming out here. People are hearing things that they either never saw or heard. 
2:06:32,2:07:35, now state wants to open a state bank ... wow Mtokozisi Baleni The real state capturers are the ones running banking - these ones being investigated here are small fries!! I'm I correct that Mr Majola hasn't testified here yet? @Mtokozisi Baleni Yes they were Zuma Tuck-shop was very heavenly subsidised 💸💰 "@BeachDude420 Peters As far as I know Mr X is much better at business compared to that Myeni guy yesterday. zandile GUMEDE boys There is that expensive Bosch microphone again! 
2:07:40,2:10:01, what happened yesterday ? thanks @Anne we need popcorn for that leave microphones man Mr Myeni has selective amnesia "Peace to all. May we see true accountability for all involved what on earth is happening in SA it looks like there is no clean business anymore. Middle man is the business now yup indeed I jnow @Oscar.. its a joke Myeni had her sticky fingers in many looting projects .. "@See Earth ""Mr X"" has asked for this limited anonymity because he knows that the majority of the voting public are not interested and will remain unaware of these revelations." 
2:10:15,2:12:24, I didn’t join the ANC for my family to be poor cant beat them join them I'm back on 404.See yah😎 Struggle credentials and entitlement go hand in hand with ANC! @clive wat did u expect from comies? @Clive i hve heard that statement before..... And the poorest of the poor are living in shacks it’s a crying 😢 shame osca N there are people who wanted to Nationalise SARB now they see it is loosing momentum now they resort to state bank because once u have SOE as a ruling class you can control it for money launder uggghh 
2:12:26,2:14:48, laundering @Roza essack Proudly South African. The Guptas learned from the Miyeni's and Zuma's... "Yesterday the amount being investigated appeared to be R2m. However Parlement decided that no action will be taken before this inquiry is finalised and a determination has been made. Sub j applies. how do these people sleep at nite when people go hungry nd without a roof over their heads @Concerned South African Yes that was one of the translations that Miyeni charged the VNA water board. This is Mr X and Majola stefanuti stocks white company same as gavin Watson no one is clean The Chinese owned Standard Bank our own people looted this country then we want to stand up nd blame others 
2:14:49,2:16:26, what was Majola doing with so much cash ? You dats too much @Roza essack You assume these people have a conscience. @Wendy Greeff ...Thats surprising. This is a commission and the subjudice rules apply only when a matter is in a Court environment. But then again....... Where is the NPA arrest Majola would appear Mt Majola needed lots of noola you dont worry abt your own people then how is any other person going to worry abt our people shame on them SA is very Corrupt once and for all Flashy cars they should execute Zuma and Malema for coruption 
2:16:29,2:17:56, The only people who have taken Dudu to court are OUTA. Hawks and NPA missing in action. Mr X was too compliant MR MAJOLA????he's wet on his pants right now.... We will not see any action this year. Parlement will not allow this. who is this guy They study how dodgy laws and bank regulations So is Mr Majola in this room now or is he in a waiting room? yhooo kunzima o kae majola? 
2:18:08,2:19:31, Can't wait to hear from Majola @Dominic Przybylski Because they were effectively rendered useless during Zuma administration... Majola is present why does he want to be called mr x he was compliant in all of this so y protect him let him face the people of our country bloody crook "@Dominic Przybylski ..@Anne M. ..@Elvis Malakoane ..What are your thoughts on a Selection vs.Election process for Government Representatives? MP""s etc. including the President and Cabinet." Mr Majola😲😲😲😲 yonke into ithi Majola the whole cabinet should be fired throw them all out "And we have such a clueless or corrupt billionaire President that he was ""shocked"" by existence of state capture

Totals please chairperson isnt firm enough.. he should have punched Zuma when he had a chance Thulani Bikani the interpreter of today is spot on agreeed My people do we know why is the identify of ubaba uMBUKENI is withheld? because everyone who is involved is known to him?? Now Judge Zondo you read my mind lol...!! Thank you judge. You and Ms Hofmeyr deserve the highest respect. "Ow wow 
2:23:02,2:24:44, "@Oscar sorry no they can slap zuma but not take his muney @Oscar N The cost of this enquiry is peanuts compared to what is stolen by members of our SOE's every week. @Sidney P nothing spot on with this interpreter. mtokozisi baleni only forensic reports will help us "To do that they will have to amend constitution. And when it was created They can only strip benefits if he is impeached@makhosi nobhatyi without all dem peanuts SA is a 3rd world country 110 
2:24:45,2:26:09, freeze everybody.s accounts bongile Sango yesterday's​ interpreter was worse compared to this one ubaba's web of corruption is everywhere Problem with this commission is that it will only report about it's findings once all evidence has been heard. In the meantime all guilty are spending their loot when we all know they are guilty! @Oscar N Definitely. myeni company "🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ safa nkosi yam whats zuma ubaba net worth so far?

He doesn't understand numbers. amen Rosa "And what about killers like the ""Krugersdorp Killers"". Should they all receive the death sentence as well?..@Zeekat" bongile sanko if she is then she has improved a lot from yesterday

ZUMA HURT ALL DEM PEOPLE AND SHOULD BE SACRIFICED ACCORDINGLY @Sidney P even DCJ commended her earlier saying she's doing very well today. I of course thought she was doing great yesterday too🤣🤣🤣 Why is the guy anonymous? What is he scared of? 
2:30:28,2:31:21, they wanna kill him pheladi lamola 😂😂 No no Yesterday she almost adjourned the commission.... death threats @TG Swartlane People in EFF/ANC call her a privileged white land thief and a member of white monopoly capital. Premier is Myeni's business. Thalente Myeni. where is he? anonymous why??? "@TG Swartlane Who wants to kill him? THATS WHY THEY SHOULD EXECUTE ZUMA SO HE CAN HURT NOBODY ANYMORE

I thought she was perfect. But then again I am Pedi so 🤷‍♀️ "Pastor J He could still be recognised 
2:32:31,2:34:37, Pheladi Lamola I'm pedi too there is no reason that can be accepted for Zuma to commit such crime.i m saying this as umxhosa omnyama. Zeekat is too extreme though... @Person of interest ..100%correct @person of interest yes zuma hurted everybody and therefore should be punished by death Pheladi Lamola Yesterday she frustrated the chair and the witness and personally I was irritated "my point exactly...they knw whos Isibonelo cc @ Peter sant makaboshwe Zuma and his cronies I missed that 
2:34:43,2:35:53, there is no point in all this we need a militairy tribunal against zuma And so was he during the trial of those killers. He didnt want the young girl to go to jail for even a day and abused anyone who said so. Therein lies the reason for the question@Person of interest and death by firing squad Who’s the big fish in all these web????? @Loyiso Mr X is camera shy everybody involved now know who he is Who caused the whole thing? "Zeekat we can't make excuses about apartheid.yet Zuma is killing his own black people. that is nonsense. @TG Swartlane Cadre deployment. 
2:36:10,2:36:52, Hmm 🤔 Thieves.... @Peter Sant killed how? black people dont belong to Zuma People just go all out to steal from us "They explained yesterday that the people who are implicated will know who he is and he is ok with that "however The whole thing is not caused by a single person. It is caused by the soviet-inspired policies of the rulling party. @person of interest coruption exists because it is unpunished. let it be punished by death and there'll be no coruption 
2:37:28,2:38:20, Thieves can't speak English..... 😂🤣😂 BOOM!! Thalente Myeni did recall anything yesterday now there is evidence today by mr X revealed his company received money witness is invisible Talent Myeni must be arrested @Peter Sant Apartheid was wrong....
