Gordhan is above the law die 2 brein selle hebruik dit... ANC ARE the law "@Keith Odwa No GORDHAN is not above the law gordan is above the law

Gordhan doesnt respect this commission but eventually he will cross examined and exposed as the liar he is Thy don't no wats going on every one do there thing. 
12:57,13:54, This is a HUGE waste of money!!! "@Andrew Mboweni Andile Ramaphosa has no contract with Government nor business people must not misuse information into a political debate they busy with tenders - they cant come to court An actual minister interested in combating corruption is too busy to make it to the inquiry. the truth must prevail 🤣🤣🤣@Funicanz he is trying to find the stolen money for SAA the truth must prevail lol he had to cover his face with the mask 
14:32,16:05, 😂funny. Well Gordhan is a card carrying comunist so this is the way a commie country operates "Pravin you skelm I hope we won't take another 20min for file arrangements and numbering @makhosi nobhatyi i am referring to the bosasa contract it should had not happened andile ramaphosa must desist from such activities with the state wether it is a fair tender he is the son Gordon should be summoned as a lesson to all others with non valid excuses why only wn ppl need to b cross examine always hv some excuses like I didn't not hv enough time t read the scripts or this no eff says it long time ago we must watch out this man called Gordon @Andre Van Zyl - I so agree with you 
16:17,20:52, nonsense we just heard frm d state attorney representing Mr. Gordan To be honest...I don't trust Gordhan' anyway "The ANC steals approx R375 Waste of tax payers money. Gordan has learnt the State's weaknesses and he is capitalising on it. He can't be put to jail until proven guilty in front of the Court. This is unfair DCJ !!!!!! ..... Judge Makhubela was issued a directive when she didnt appear now cross examination for min Gordon is postoned just like that no its unfair i repeat its unfair DCJ Time that DCJ grow a pair and act like someone that is running the show. "@ Andrew Mboweni yes I understand but he never done anything to government Bosasa it’s a private company  "Change the law..guilty until proven innocent. In the interim 
21:18,25:36, This is Mr Mogashwa The chair should have been strict from the start...he wakes up late about that.. there's a lot of COVID-19 infections that's gonna come out of this commission for allowing ppl not t wear masks since we heard that this virus can fly around lol ? I wish it can start with Zondo "Mogashoa love you guys "@Tutu Mkhize you are misinformed no one is trying to tarnish Zuma’s name and his faction

ANC has fallen @T K I'm falling asleep nw Interesting thanks guysI hope Cyril is watching the chat line 😂 Its sad but the 3% ANC vote base that watch this due to access will not make a difference to the 97% that blindly votes for them for a free T shirt and 1 meal @FieliesSA yup that a reallity call alright 
35:00,37:53, ANC is over :washhands: The New Anc is Defunct. Theivery is epic Such a shame as the ANC was not meant to tarnish SA but to improve it. c congrats that's actually not a bad idea @T K because I've got a load that I've been trying t postpone till tea adjournment kkkkk hahaha Its up to ex- ANC supporters to reach out to those people and make them aware what their government is doing. 
38:54,41:15, "@1 Million Views They rely on people like you to keep them in power. Wake up. They have been ""self correcting"" for more than a decade now" waste self enriching or self correcting? "People break the law and they must face their own consequences regardless of the color of their skin or position they occupy  "Who is ANC @makhosi nobhatyi Amen Best boy in the house Dice boy in the house from Botswana dont know much about anc but the corruption nd theft is to much from head this was one of the best movement but now greed nd arrogance pride nd not takin responsibility wil kil it 
41:20,48:04, South Africa has the potential to be the best country in the world. Just needs new leaders. It’s a fact. We are the cradle of mankind ANC is the collective of crooked members of south African Society "ANC is an alliance of crooks "Fake news not allowed Tebogo We we relax until those who are found on the wrong side of the law behind bars finished n klaar. @ Funicanz I am coming I don't care what this is about...just let us get back to work AND we want the tobacco and alcohol ban lifted!!!! Madimpe """ ACTIO POPULARIS / CLASS ACTION 4 LOOTERS 2 APPEAR IN COURT""" Is this live really in real time? 
48:14,54:21, YAWN "State capture is going to finish off the where the 500 robberies left all in all state capture inquiry will cost the country how much? Are we going to have prosecution or wasting of Tax payers money? The State capture has cost SA R700m thus far 🙆🏼‍♀️🙆🏼‍♀️ NPA is a lame duck the closing of alcohol and cigarettes wasn't all about crime it was due to Corona. "a commission to probe the state capture commission Lucky no te ban of tobacco and alcohol was to please Kopdoek and the Hat Cele!!! 
54:46,1:01:52, WHAAZZAAP!! I know but it was boosting the economy to assist with money that is being by Inquiries and irregular tenders They will not achieve anything but waste money and time. sabc..synchronize PLEASE This is pointless. ANC will stay above the law. I agree with the other people. this is just a waste of time. And why are we still voting anc to power if these are a waste of time? I never voted once in my life. so you should ask yourself that question. We are not ignorant lol you touched someone's feelings 
1:02:19,1:10:36, i feel the same Now they are using delay tactics for the elections so they can win over their pple just be F.....over with the next Nation desaster... Thami will keep on voting for corrupt ANC because of Apartheid 🤦‍♀️ this is all over the world politics has turned out to be power not servicing the nation "Yes  So the best thing to do to get over Apartheid is to suffer under the ANC? "You are not forced to vote for ANC We need to develop an no racial no apartheid party in the country. all these parties are doing is to continuously misuse state resources to benefit themselves. or keep voting for the ANC because you too have your hands on the cookie jar 
1:10:55,1:15:27, "sUICIDAL "sUICIDAL every person has a right to vote for a party. Our purpose to vote is not just to put a particular party or individual into power but rather to elect to have our lives and surrounds improved. The Judge is veery sober Thami doesn't want improvements she likes things just the way it is. What people do not realize is that there is much better life than what the ANC offer. People voted for the NP for the very same reasons people now vote for the ANC - there is no strong opposition uphi lama ANC tender 🤣 If you feel a specific party or individual is not to your benefit then you may vote for another party. Voting for the same party again will not give a different outcome based on their track record "Compare 2003 and today is far better 
1:15:28,1:17:21, People voted for the NP because they knew this would happen. but they are dumb waste of our money. useless this thing. very useless who is gonna recover a billion that is used by this committee. Just like the masses from rural kzn Zimbabwe has experienced. South Africa still needs to learn the hard way How long is T-break? Zimbabweans are an example of educated people still making uneducated decisions. funny how similar the lives of Zimbabweans and South Africans are so very similar... an African curse?? that is very true 
1:17:46,1:24:56, Zimbabweans voted as die hards for Zanupf like it was a soccer team and sadly most of the population is now in South Africa. I asked some of them why did you not vote for another party and what did they say They voted wrong because of the brainwash methods of Marxism I saw a photo of an old woman next to a shack wearing a oversize ANC T-shirt and I didn't feel any sympathy. She got what she voted for The majority party needs to be treated as they treat us. I saw a arm less black guy wearing a DA t-shirt he told me he used to vote for the ANC before his arms were cut off I didn't ask any questions after that. Guess his legs will be next 
1:27:49,1:39:26, Why do people wear political party clothing? it is not a sports team. "You can support this arm less guy if you want to. You will find him on a street corner in Albertskroon 11H40 long gone DCJ "Sanjay Yoh hes still on This hole thing is about trillions of rands that went missing. And guess what...... That money will never be returned. what even is this and why is it in my recommended hahaha Refaat are you from South Africa? This is so tedious. Enough now. There is enough evidence to prove that unethical people will be corrupt if given an opportunity. We don't need years worth of testimony to enlighten us. 
1:39:28,1:43:46, australia hahaha this is a courtroom in South Africa Maybe all the money is in Cuba!!Remember Zuma loves that country!!! oh ok well goodluck We now need to find a way to prevent corruption and how are we going to do that when there is no law enforcement? "whats wrong now  BEE has cause huge corruption. EWC is going to put the nails into the economy's coffin. EWC is simply legalised theft. 
1:44:45,1:50:06, I made submissions to that commission online from June 2018 onwards until I physically came there on 21 February 2019 but thereafter I realized that the Commission itself is captured. this commission is doing outstanding work but we still await Zuma to testify I was automatically unfairly dismissed by the KZN ANC and KZNDOE on 13 June 2016 for being a Shembe discipline. BEE is also legalise theft. Supporting BEE is like supporting Ramaphosa with his billions while other people starve. Ramaphosa has made billions by creating laws that people should hand over their com @Thulani Mpanza I call it#zondononsense I think we've forgotten what the purpose of this commission is. It's become a bloated waste of time. All Zondo can do in the end is make recommendations which the ruling party can ignore. I'm going to go now and stop wasting my time here. Because I know at the end of the day nothing will be solved. "This commission @Dominic Przybylski - and it is going to happen. same as with the arms deal inquiry. we need to have a green revolution at the voting booth and rid SA from anc scourge 
1:53:17,2:06:10, well ok kon ho name All commission are setup to divert the current status on the actual issues faced by the country. This is a military strategy "Currently the country focus is on the commission outcome It is unfortunate that even judges have allowed themselves to be used by anc factions. This guy who is cross examining is also involved in the prasa saga "@Dominic Przybylski - True. But I think with the latest amendments to the state capture regulations stealing from the public is inappropriate and uninspired in our constitute 
2:09:59,2:20:34, "@skilash Skilash NPA has evaporated. We should be hearing testimony in specific court prosecutions which lead to convictions This commission is a dog which does not even bark let alone bite. It has no teeth. Same as our president. Morning hellooo...viewers helloooo "I doubt there will be many criminal prosecutions from Zondo commission. A lot of info is circumstantial. At best where's mr Maleka 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 
2:21:46,2:30:31, "Remember we are getting closer to the elections. Mr ""Cereal"" will force Mrs Batohi to pick one or some of the BIG Politician(s) for us to see that he is doing something about his cronies." "Only time people get thrown into jail is when they sell somebody a cigarette No prosecutions for theft. "This is a very serious offense Should be Theft from a people is quite serious It high time to see the outcomes of state capture @ Sammy.... only time will tell "We are in a country 
2:30:38,2:33:43, "We have a government which calls theft ""redistribution of wealth"" or ""expropriation without compensation"" or ""radical economic transformation"" so it cannot be treated as a crime." A total time and money waste as nothing will come from this we need a new party in govt lol according to my affidavit make sure you say the same thing mineer You must resolve the present in order to move on @ Aurthur... or nuke the present....lol sa politics needs a reset button this country needs a reset button 
2:33:43,2:35:54, This is a joke how can someone just call at an eleventh hour to say he has other parliamentary commitments as a result this commission is just a waste of money "You don't want anyone trying to repeat Will never happen exactly Arrhur corruption will ALWAYS be part of government.... nature of the beast ie: Politics "There is just too many members involved the scale in this country is just ridiculous there was corruption in the apartheid area.... there is mass corruption in the current era 
2:35:57,2:38:19, The ANC will always be more important than the people. "so we open up all the files looks that way Elma.... 2yrs this commission is goin gon You must stop the bad behavior in its tracks and discourage anyone ever attempting such the process of accountability is just too long "we keep paying for their corruption "swift Yes 
2:38:31,2:41:32, We are in a country of two systems: Capitalist system and Communist system - the host and parasite respectively. Unfortunately the parasite is now bigger than the host and will be the demise of both. "they have evidence well said Ronald Wiley Look at SAPS on the news last night. Serve and protect............ need we say more "In the long run "SAPS people meaning us "sorry Elma Kevin I don't think you are the only one with that feeling towards them. 
2:43:03,2:50:38, I know there is allot of countries with issues but honestly I think SA ranks at the top of the list. Coming home with GOLD MEDALS. One super cool government 🙂 The R70 billion borrowed from IMF at 1%. Rand has already lost 2% against Dollar since then so already we will have to repay 3% i.e. three times more. "DoDo I wonder who the poor persons were who had been given the task to type out these reports:( We cannot carry on stealing what we are borrowing. It's not the government which will have to repay. It's the people who will have to pay. @Riaan DW…. So true. 🤔 Which other African country has ever accessed an IMF loan? Seemingly we are the only one. I am subject to correction on this. I see us going back to the IMF in the not-too-distant future! In normal democracy the people(voters) would not allow criminals to rule them. If they are allowed to rule then the people who allowed it will have to live with the consequences. 
2:52:09,3:03:02, Expect the Government to announce a slight increase of R1OO to social grants just before the local government elections in 2021. The IMF should be informed to not hand over any funds to the government. Fund the Red Cross and have them distribute as they see fit. These funds will never get to those who needs it the most. Just R 700 million so far. @ ronald…. True "Will be better to cancel this commission is the alcohol and cigarette ban going to be discussed here?? Not yet "They are concerned about alcohol and cigarettes 🤣🤣 
3:03:36,3:08:01, alcohol and cigarettes are band but. there is still people selling and charge people alot of money how do they still get alchol and cigaretts Everything stinks. @ ronald……. nothing they do is legal They dont think trough issues! True This government should be overthrown This is not the new South Africa #ZimbabweanslivesMatters That will be very easy to do Neo but we cannot stand together as a unity so who will do it 
3:08:08,3:10:46, All South Africans should unite to remove this rot "White @ronald. Food parcels and R350 grant for 6 months will secure votes for the govt. Don't forget the Gov FREE promise "United we stand "@Elma Duvenhage we need to unite so true *if people are voting with their hearts and nothing else. 
3:10:59,3:17:13, "Yesterda DoDo Sad but true. "When they get sick Your nostrils work one at a time. "whoever responsible for the subtitles I do not have a job and also applied for R350.I did not qualified....maybe its because I am white?? "I could not claim my UIF @Gerda7. It is because that R350 has gone into the pockets of some officials. What happened to the contribution I made all these years??? Who used my money 
3:18:38,3:25:31, What's the best Wi-Fi name you've seen? If I had known that I will be refused my money I would have paid that money into a bank account every month so that I would be able to use it when I needed it "I want to cry "Don't you find it so funny that now they can assist with R350 for the un-employed This is a mafia state. R350 PER MONTH is too little. Cant even buy you a loaf of bread a day Why would you buy bread every day? Cyril Ndaba 👍 Because that is what R350 a month can buy. Even potatoes are a luxury 
3:27:38,3:40:34, R250 a month translates to a little over R11.50 A DAY I'm not disputing that 350 is too little. I just want to know why you want to buy bread everyday What else can you buy for R11.50 a day. What can else can you buy. A kilo of meat cost around R110. The USA government give every household 400 US dollars a month.EVERY household!Why dont they do it here in SA ?They give money for people to get children and this is not sustainable! "Rice and pap are cheaper than bread ひ ありがとう りんご理知 銀座日 bro what is meant by that "You still have to pay rent @ronald wiley it brings tears to eyes. how about border open
