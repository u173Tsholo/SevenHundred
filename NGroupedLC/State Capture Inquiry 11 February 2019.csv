20:25,21:35, This adv is letting me down you know! Can somebody summarise what is going on here for me? Embracement for the crooks guyz not blacks come on To be fair to the advocate exhibits should be sorted out by the attorney not her Deliberate attempt to scuttle the cross-examination otherwise how can she come to such important occasion with moduled up files Why is Mrs Mentor Incognito today. SABC!!! "I can be a better adv @Dylan problem is the Bundles The Bosasa scandal got me thinking that the Guptas were small fish to fly. 
21:37,24:17, They got the info last night. I don’t blame the adv. this is an attorneys job. @Pitso Mosetlhe what about the bundles? Can you please ellaborate? problem is that she wants lie nothing else still getting paperwork from the lawyer..jarrr dom bliksems sound postpone and give them another week Can anybody tell me what the delay is from? Lets all echo the expression that it is human to err. A microcosm of our justice system on display. 
24:43,27:23, @dylan... paperwork is as messed up as a kindergarten child's homework Again the attorney who happens to be male needs to deal with files not this advocate what have they been up to all week and weekend ? "mess mess mess they could not get thing in order! attorney was at the Chiefs Pirates game no work was done..wife helped him this morning "Thanks @Grayboy ...

28:57,30:11, lots of mistakes today still talking cele hw zet A file stuck in Ramaphosa's nose. This advocate was unprepared and it is annoying. All other evidence leaders never had a problem with bundles ndlovu show respect He just needs to sneeze🤧wherever he is and then we will have the commission going ahead. I see postponement coming Cant someone fix the graphic its LOOKS like I WILL me ..... @SABC Digital News 
30:17,32:14, Aooow Ndlovu really You will hear just now they will say we adjourn due to bundle files not in order. annexures guys not bundles the guy in the white shirt looks like the problem Annexures or bundle what ever. Disgrace here we go Well done girl. she managed to sort out the attorneys mess. Cheese kops lost the files. mxm 
32:16,33:55, "@Bheki where is the lovely registrar She doesn't even feel remorseful for a shoddy job..and soon somebody will claim blacks are not being employed like their white counterparts....a white advocate wont make such blunder welcome all . True that @Parabridge mmmm What a statement. Errors are not colour based. 45 minutes and counting to sort out files...hiabo..the devil is a liar Parabridge EVERYONE MAKE MISTAKES 
34:06,35:13, "They were just heading for Zuma and this commission will fail to find anything directly linked to him Its not an error. Its poor planning. "It was not her fault. she received a brief. the attorney must fix bundles or annexures Mentor submitted affidavit yesterday...really "But this is really bad we must not put colour wer colour is not needed we all make mistakes This files come on the witness will be more confused!!! Like some race groups are always late and some always on time. 
36:17,38:22, 47 mins delay...eishhh what is not bad This Commission is a waste of time and money. ndlovu are u Zuma defender??we are only concetn about our children future here.whether he is guilt or not.the fact of the matter is he is not the head of state.myb wn we born again. nobody will go to jail. trust me. @Africa Continent ...that is why you watching...shame on u "yes this commission is wasting time and money the guptas are wasting time again "Jeevan 
38:22,40:20, why giving priority to Guptas that undermine our country? Jail is just a waste of tax payers money agree Malebo Gupta rep on point. Ravin myb u have a point.we must arrest them on their act. money is lost in Dubai I'm just telling you that this commission with turn badly and swallow those who've been acting holier. When the clip was taken There was an SIU in the public domain indicating that Bosasa was involved in corruption. Wasn't that enough for Thuli to investigate? How did she miss the Bosasa scandal? 
40:52,42:08, What is Oom doing now? "She didn't miss it @Thando Nkutha LOL YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THE TRUTH This commission is just a dress rehearsal. I want to see politicians locked up Zondo is not having it No mane Zondo. Please its Monday I'm late. video of what Is Eheee. Eheee a south african thing. Ummm.....ehh.....ummm....ehhhh.. 
42:25,43:51, haha No Gupta ...no video evidence...period oh. ty Zondo seems compromised and seeks a certain outcome of this Commission. I agree@Slindile Ngcobo 🚮 "any videographer has editing tools. can tell any story. we need raw footage untampered Yes chair Imagine the Guptas and Zuma getting locked up. Now imagine a small hungry black boy stealing fruits from his neighbors tree. who do you think will most likely get locked up. 
44:00,45:51, He does seem captured after the SONA "it's not just him who must view a video We are watching Zondo. Don't try it. Clean Shaven Cheese kop. He's captured. HAHA Zondo doesn't want the public to see the original video election.rumours like wild fire.Mmusi will b remove after election.bcz some people of some colours are not happy bcz he is wt he is.now we can c new party. Now the witness is just sitting there doing nothing. I think today is just a wast of time Anyone in power should not be trusted in this day and age 
46:22,48:07, Musi wants 2 more provinces when the DA win MENTOR IS A LAIR!!! "there's time. if you have it why Zondo is dodging the video IS THIS THE GUPTER LAWYER ? Yes Mmusi is gone shame. They are done with him always was vote cope ndlovu y are so ..........

49:31,50:32, Under the Eff we won’t have tenders problem solved 1 hour later 🤷🏾‍♂️ What is all this about I live in America and have no idea what’s going on Thatha Zondo that they come physical and gave evidence. we should have known that the anc was corrupt how many of them went to jail before? yourself under eff you will.vbs The Guptas have never been summoned so why should they come to the commission eff equates vbs 
50:35,51:48, Exactly! this whole bunch deserves to rot in jail but akho nomnye ozobanjwe. vote anc Zuma sold the country for a plate of curry. Still cant get over that. we should actually all not vote at all. dont show up boycott the vote until this corruption cloud is donw done All video must be shown to the PUBLIC....Ventor has lied and must be exposed "do not watch the Gupta video only. If they had a pro videographer terror for president vote cope 
51:52,53:23, ANC what are they discussing mara here i am getting lost now vote ANC FOR BETTER SOUTH AFRICA AGAIN whats everyones take on us losing provinces back to how it was before? innocent please how much of a better life? they stole everything Oh Mentor. my credibility remember they made fake TV interview that did not happened. blah blah "To Thando Nkutha

Too much anger towards Zuma - there are already holes in her testimony Michael ANC kill SA credibility - she thinks it means 'put it on the credit card'

Who is this lawyer? mrng everyone my name is Sibonelo Gupta😁😀 285 dUDUZANI gUPTA 
1:04:42,1:05:44, why is the adv smilling. it's a pleasure Nick Duduzane Zuma 🤷🏽‍♀️ I'm already confused "Exploiting and looting as opposed to ""exploring""." "AJ AND RAJESH GUPTA Thabisenng Ms Mentor needs protection from of us! Can we ask a question now? Ajay not AJ @Mfundo Veerasamy vele 
1:05:47,1:06:49, "I thought the focus was now on bosasa "how can this lawyer make such a mistake ""Duduzane Gupta"" I thought the chair call for tea break you can be Gupta I'm a sec just give her your name and you can be Gupta Tactical waste of time knowing Ventor has on;y 2 days to be cross examined...Zondo is allowing to waste time Evidence leader is pathetic Can we go on to questions please mam this woman she is showing such incompetent.. she is being dealing with pages forever Duduzane Gupta? 
1:07:04,1:07:59, For me even the cross examining of mentor was not supposed to be done because the guptas refused to come in front of the commision.. This woman is about to be exposed by documented hard paper evidence😂🤣🤸🏿‍♂️⛹🏿‍♂️🤾🏿‍♂️ woooooow there we go wabanjwa muntu so the south african Boer's are trying to assassinate the cic Julius Malema hey the revolution is at stake She panicking already😭 atul was never in China Serving the Guptas.

1:08:52,1:10:06, Think we should have a tea break now? Miss Mantho I applaud you. you are brave and what I like about you is that you are articulate. this woman is annoying "The Guptas have never refused to come to testify to the commission remember Home Affairs was under Gigaba that time so it is possible they have manipulated the records Home affairs might not be a reliable source remember Jigaba has people there. "Sendo Sityebi Malusi Gigaba - pulled the string at Home Affairs at the time I have realised that no matter what the Guptas say. People have already made their mind which sad really 
1:10:11,1:11:16, "Poor and lazy advocate we need records of SAA They could even have departed from Waterkloof on their own plane....no record People might use 2 or more passport. ohoo no this woman is in competend Zondo stated that he's refusing them access because they're out of the country. The media has messed up with a lot of you. ARRIVING or ENTERING....same thing mama @slindile 😂😂😂😂😂😂 This adv!!!!! 
1:11:25,1:11:49, Can someone change the adv this advocate mara Malusi Gigaba now playing with himself in the mirror watching this. Imagine this in your moth. Well done Zondo. We want the records of Home Affairs @Nkanyiso Ndlovu but they secretely ran out of the country.. Incompetent Advocate Ja suster legally is the crucial aspect.The Guptas never will do things legally Mr Zondo is lecturing the Adv they must remove her she is stupid man 
1:11:52,1:13:03, Ntsele haha """secretly""? Why are you lying?" advocate looks confused and nervous Evidence leader is incompetent and confused LOL SO THE GUPTAS WERE OUT OF THE COUNTRY DURING THE DAYS THIS LAIR ALLEGED TO HAVE MET THEM? Guptas used water kloof exit what does malusi have to do with this now. "@Nkanyiso Ndlovu it is a fact Imagine the passport in his mouth 
1:13:08,1:14:03, What about the Water Kloof? he was the corrupt minister of home affairs this advocate 🤔🤔🤔🤔 I think Mr pretorious should take over @nkululeko njapha Mulusi gave the Guptas Citizenship illegally You guys have serious problems. Ite has been proven that one brother was here in the country yet you still refuse to listen. lets be objective "does the record also include the ""water kloof"" entry when will this commition probe the Rupert family Vitjie is lying what's the need of all these explanations we all know how the home affairs work 
1:14:04,1:15:19, Mentor and this evidence leader will mess up things Exactly They must not forget that Malusi Gigaba was the minister of Home affairs.... anything is possible. This cross axamiation has nothing to do with Gigaba you are just name droping for no reason wheres Pretorious na @Nkanyiso Ndlovu look what they are doing now..they are trying to use an old white guy to clean up their mess..why cant they come in person here? I don’t understand what is going on MENTOR IS A FILTHY LAIR!! Too much bots here talking nonsense. You can't tell bots to be objective. They are just controlled by one subjective crook 
1:15:36,1:16:40, "mentor is a blue liar "Sendo Sityebi Vytjie has top informants in high places. She does not work at the airport how can it be verified that their info was clocked in? "she has embarrassed herself Get the flight records of ZS-OAK..... and I bet you frind that he was on flights not reflected by home affairs @ Tholithemba Ntsele ... True Eff Guptas had captured even home affairs though. but they will get away as usual 
1:16:58,1:18:07, So we talking fake passports ok 👌🏽 They should ask for records on the venue in China where the DTI thing took place now people will say he left illegally Through you chair Listen Carefully She is now blabbing her mouth....lol..lol..lol..lol duduzane Gupta again 😂😂😂😂😂 🤣🤣🤣 
1:18:07,1:18:21, Hahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂 "Ok Vytjie who can substantiate your claim kwaaaaks 😂😂😂 Dudu Gupta Duduzane Gupta Again Duduzane Gupta 🤣🤣🤣 duduzani gupta kkkkkk shez trembling 
1:18:25,1:18:36, LOL WHAT DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT HIS PASSPORTS? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 "Duduzane Gupta. Salty. ""-)" Guptas must be summoned to appear in person otherwise it won't be fair for them to sit somewhere and use lawyers to cross exam witnesses in the commission They must ask China for documentation she is still nervous.. this lady is a disgrace to great women kwaaaaaa why everyone says duduzane gupta😂😂😂😂😂 Lol 
1:18:37,1:19:21, whos brother? I just hope she won't say.... I don't remember 😂😂😂😂😂 Exactly Mentor. You are on point. "the Guptas might have many passport now bringing wate kloof for no reason Point in case. the Wedding. Gupta &Zumas are twins this Duduzane Gupta issue is serious 
1:19:29,1:19:54, Mr Duduzane Gupta😂 "Liar Liar @juny tebele hahaha Lesotho passports haha she got a point there its true lies lies 😂😂😂😂 panty on fire. haaaaaa Who is this lady 
1:19:55,1:20:36, did she just say duduzani gupta Who told you? They were given permission to land by Number One. "Sean She is Trying to hide the Truth using Wedding Exactly Prince @Nthabiseng Malebo ....yeah you right.. on the passports mentor needs to be mentored so as to be clear and clearer The rabbit is in the bag🤣🤣 
1:20:39,1:21:16, E ya mme mentor. using the wedding to hide NICE AND ACCURATE RESPONSE why him alone the whole team would have gone without home affairs "She’s mumbling nje Proper response She is speculating widely and will fall flat on her face. "any person eciting or entering any country goes through all immigration processes no shes not 
1:21:18,1:21:58, 😁 If Atul left illegally he would not be able to enter China. Are they deliberately calling him Duduzane Gupta so they don't have to say Zuma? "Something simple like the whereabouts of Gupta on a certain date? If they cannot establish that Fakey Mentor The chair is speaking tooo softly today. Rough Monday "So true  Especially on cross-examination @Deon Meyer "Lixoki loSisi 
1:21:59,1:22:50, you could say the woman is a lier but wat is she gonna gain out of coming here and wasting her time vele? shes not lying but stating the truth but confused dont judge here I think she should request to testify in her home language to answer question to her best this woman is lying Blue Monday I think it make sense that these people were travelling in and out of the country without being checked so it obvious they would be no record to trace their movement @nkululeko njapha why would she lie? school her Mr Zondo @Nqobizitha Khumalo remember those guys have multiple passports..when entering china he enters with another passport not an SA one.. is Zondo preparing the witness? 
1:22:57,1:24:17, She needed to be reprimanded sound very poor Nkululeko why are you saying she is lying The chair has seen something from this woman. That is why his saying this to the witness. Zondo is trying to help Mentor out of trouble She is just disgracing hardworking black African women.... She just needs some coaching on how to express herself.. She is not SURE get it from the Commissioner She's a fairytale teller this one who must we trust home affairs or mentor 
1:24:23,1:25:12, lol hai madoda you say fake mentor Flaky testimony by Vytjie Mentor is just wasting our time and data struuu passports are easy to come by.it is encouraged in some "that's what liars do @MZONKE CEBISA Poor Fake Mentor.She wanted to be popular on the face of the medial. @ Amos🤣🤣🤣🤣 
1:25:13,1:26:16, Mentor is bad witness all together. her testimony must be set aside Remember at that's time Mr Gigs was still minister lesedi u got too much data booo yho "Don't forget she occupied some sort of Government position.What qualified her for that position "She testified she met the Guptas outside the country LOL at answering Coaching Mentor has not been to school is ANC member ZONDO IS TRYING TO HELP HER GET OUT OF SHADY STORY!! 😂 
1:26:31,1:27:23, Zondo is basically telling Mentor to becarefull not to lie under oath bcos he has seen something Mentor totally useless....same as Bathabile and all the other deadwood in Parliament so i can see we have people who have the truth because ms mentor is lying. "Makwa where is this fotage she's losing it so much talk but nothing really being said @Siyabonga Magwaza haha but they are your leaders Through you cahir 
1:27:26,1:28:03, this is an embarrassment.. really She'z not SURE! 😂 "Is Agrizzi coming back to testify hayi she is lying kengoku "Vytjie is right. She is leading them towards a much bigger way Gupta's/Zuma. They can leave with out customs "Very stupid guys this womna is in trouble "She is not going to answer on point Is Vytjie now the evidence leader? 
1:28:11,1:30:16, This lawyer is questioning on behalf of who?the state or the accused? State she is lost maan... she even calls wrong pages "Home affairs @Antonie Goosen agree! Leaving our country might be possible. Entering any other country is key because it exposed that country’s security She must be tried criminally for lying to a commission set up by SA Constitution... @Nqobizitha Khumalo do yout hink crooks care about the security of any country? Info from home affairs should be inadmissible. Nothing credible can come from home affairs. 
1:30:20,1:31:43, guys we should know by now that the guptas knew how to cheat the system This one belongs to a mental institution for more mentor[ship]. """home affairs lied"" and now ""Emirates Lied""" this is funny "Not sure about Ms Mentor's mental state of mind "Mentor was hired by the Oppenheimer sponsored faction of anc wooooooow this advocate This commission will unseat Ramaphosa🤞🏿 Mentor has allot of info but when it comes to presentation the wheels come off. 
1:31:48,1:32:51, Nope. Vytie exaggerated the story. She forgot that these records will come. True @gcina nkosi you might be right 'MADAM CHAIR wow Ramapostpone must come testify this lady maaaad clueless The witness is completely lost. Tjo. Bakiti hahaha 
1:32:54,1:34:17, "Vytie Mentoor is not the sharpest tool in the shed. All she could say is Lepantsula Madam Chair. THIS PERSON IS LYING GET HER OUT OF HERE!! Its becoming exciting haha "she is just rude pls musa u can generalise about black women @TUCKER...you not the Judge...relax Agriizi must be cross-examined and the whole world we get to see and hear about the truth 
1:34:20,1:35:12, mentor meet them finish and klaar. how they travelled cant be mentors problem "Nkanyosa Ndlovu @Gen Cas. She's throwing herself under the bus. I thing so this is quite diplomacy hence she is being grilled no lunch/ tea break - any interruption may cause Mentor to forget why she is there and what she said earlier @Parabridge i agree! these Dribbs and Drabbs we tired of dribbs Just follow the commission and come back to comment here once it has happened 
1:35:22,1:35:56, Zondo is trying to defend Ventor...but the whole world is watcjing "legal jargons! pagenated just joining in dd I mss anything yet.....please update why files get to witnesses at the last minute "The real captures of state r WMC guys u missing something here malusi gigaba is in the same bed as from Gupta's and zumas now why do u think wont be easy for these ppl to manipulate travel schedule? do u know how easy it Mme mentor is in trouble. The lawyer didn't show her the dribs and drabs the only person who told only the truth before this commission is Angelo...... @Desmond Masilela ai she is f-ing herself too hard then

1:37:20,1:37:41, Gupta Duduzani Gupta is no longer supposed to be funny Vytjie is doing more harm to her public persona by her inconsistent testimony. she discovered it on Friday Halluya ! Duduzane Gupta???? 😁😁😁😁 Why r we sponsoring anc factional battle thru taxes.Lets go straight to the real culprits Duduzane Gupta. suites him well though lol DUDUZANE gupta lol his spirit doesn't lie

3:00:05,3:01:45, "Faithful south Africans  Go back to work ek wil die advocate vloek man "Lol 🙈 @Anne M. green virgin "@Anne M am not judging All these questions seem to be question the commission investigation. maybe the guptas travelled on dubai or Indian passports under their other names... remember they had to hide everything so deletion is probable. 
3:01:55,3:02:38, that is a women's shirt. the buttons are opposite side to men's shirt...just saying... she need a helper this woman Now we are looking for everything that didn't happen. Maybe Myeni deleted the records and Gigaba manipulated records at home affairs. The Fly emirates records are questionable.

Home Affairs Manipulated. Emirates records manipulated. Will people ever agreed that Mentor put some salt to her evidence.

Jirrrrrr this advocate man this advocate gives me heartburn 
3:11:39,3:12:10, Is Vitjie MAntor a BANTU state was captured so manipulation was the order of the day This adv is the evidence leader not the adv for the implicated parties. For now she is just leading evidence cross examination will follow subsequently. records manipulated it was Monday. What is a Bantu Home affairs and SAA were under the people who are known to be in the GUPTS Pockets.
