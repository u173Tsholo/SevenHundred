"Mogweng not Malema corruption country Pule Tsotestsi u also one of the criminal scheme hi "@Shadrack Moalusi Zondo is competent to handle this commission 
54:01,56:32, "@pule tsotetsi Malema would have asked them by now I do feel sorry for Mr Mokoena. I think he was between a rock and s hard place. Pule Tsotetsi he must send strong message to this criminals. N show them no one is above the law @pheladi for sure Shame playing the victim now "lets not forget that the conditions in which Mr Mokoena worked seem to be the common place in all government settings. do as told or you are out. "Malema would have to do the same My question to Mr Mokoena is why he didn't whistle blow then? 
57:03,57:30, @melita yes the matter in which they were implicated " They don’t have a choice because voters will kick them out he knows he does not want his phuphu dug either. Whistle blow to who? @hlempe maybe president of parys look at the number of professionals that are roaming the street due to refusing to tow the illegal instructions "@Shadrack Moalusi Well who will get the msge?Cele doesnt care when SAPS murder a 6 year old "he was waiting for the right time to blow the whistle

58:35,59:49, First witness in a long time to make a lot of sense compared to all the nonsense we have heard before Mike Clark true my brother our justice system is dead It is strange that the HOD did not know who these contractors were nor did he enquire..very odd. "what infrastructure they build that for there benefit Really @levy manaka yes i also believe that Mr Mokoena was waiting for the right time. who would listen to him that time because he would just be silent with a gun that was some fresh air @moiseng mashego agreed seems like a decent honest man. Pity he is black listed from working in the ANC corrupt gov. He should apply to the DA they might employ him. @pheladi you 100%correct 
59:57,1:05:46, "Angelo Doubel  The HOD is part of the scheme to defraud public funds that was for the purpose of housing the poor. It is so shocking 🙈 "shud he blew the whistle by then @blake yogi very true hi all mostly damaged was done from 2010 to 2018. "HOD had an ethical duty and responsibility to report this highly irregular unlawful practice Who's on the dock? @Nathi Malema was an ANC member and benefited financially when he was the youth league leader. so no hypocrisy please. don't tell me there's nothing on him Who's on the dock?

2:36:23,2:40:03, what country is this meeting filmed live at? @Mashudu Matshira In South Africa you are innocent untill proven guilty These corrupt officials must be sent to a particular prison in Malawi called Mawura prison they will wish they would have had been never done it yes but it takes 50 years to get convicted by then u lived your whole life That is true. @ Reuben..ALCATRAZ "@Reuben Moyo "call a spade @Akhonamandla Gala In South Africa you find prisoners swimming in Robin Island😂😂😂😂😂

It is frightening to hear big number in the millions and billions talked about small change in your pocket. "@Luqmaan 
2:43:12,2:46:15, In China murder case is allocated 1 day in court & verdict same day ! They may get it wrong some times but crime is super low @ sorry who is this guy being interrogated? same question...whos this guy? is it HOD Mokoena? The Correction Facilities in South Africa is way tooo SMALL to accommodate all the frickin skelms that looted the state coffers he will be okay he comes from the ANC school of lying no. this is the chief director in mokoena's office who's been fired Chinese people still respect the laws too send them to the Northpole 
2:46:23,2:50:19, Ok Lezil. whats hies name? @mongworld oops sorry the name is difficult for me Skelm no 311 We miss Death Penalty in South Africa🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 @mongworld Mphikeleli Kaizer something south Africa Congress Mbuso especially for those monsters killing women everywhere in SA name at time stamp 1:27:43 these guys though acting innocent were accessories to crime..ie.accomplices whether they did it voluntarily or involuntary..so they very guarded with wat they say 
2:50:24,2:52:15, @L Ll THE MERE OF HAVING IT AS A PUNISHMENT WILL DETER A LOT FROM DOING WRONG MEC ZWANE DANKIE BABA Mr Mphikeleli Kaizer Maxatshwa Are you sure you want the death penalty back? death penalty is not constitutional in SA and i support that. @Lawrence thank u Mbuso absolutely 👍 i support death penalty..serves no purpose keeping for life @a b c Yes - there are some crimes that are so egregious that they deserve nothing less 
2:52:24,2:56:12, There are always arguments for and against but in some cases death penalty is appropriate got labour laws to prevent slavery thats not True ive talked to people from Africa They believe in Honer killing s there not Americans @L Ll - the problem is that life is not life in SA - it's probably only about 15 years with our sloppy parole system Jacqui most countries are lenient too eg England and Australia life has a min and max sentence Australia is just too lenient compared to the rest of the world the punishment is intended to be a deterrant for future such crimes..if it fails then one has to look at alternative and harsher penalties as deterrant..so one has to go the next step up..death... LIFE SHULD MEAN EXACTLY THAT NOT WE'LL LET YOU OUT AFTER 12 YEARD IF YOU BEHAVE? Justice for all means Justice for victims 
2:56:14,2:59:04, I just think that people who beg for the death penalty to be reinstated don't really know what they're asking for... "@LowJack187 I'm very sorry the slavery you are looking for in South Africa is not there and not constitutional Can't compare. Australia have very little crime We need a similar kind of commission that would look into the former white government since it also looted and enriched the whites. @abc indeed 👍 "We also have laws against murder abc the same applies to people who want the death penalty abolished lol it just depends on your opinion lol @L Ll There is no current death penalty.... and it's not a matter of opinion... it's a matter of people's lives... these criminals become a burden to society
