You should read on how the NPA is Captured in SA... The President is the one who Appoints The DPP how could it be not captured 
51:47,53:26, we will kick their diner tables to show them that the time of pushing slaves is over. we are tired seriously. @Felix he stated earlier that they had stepped into a land mine of self enrichment Molefe was supeoned to appear fils de l'homme First of all let me point this out this to you if there was no apartheid in the being we would not be sitting in this situation.

57:12,58:43, "@ Magda Seguin. The answer is that we learned to fight white supremacy during apartheid If there are any body in this country that does not belief we are govern by thiefs anf private sector and that we are going to worse and hope it will change in the next generations Judge is as sharp as a tack and they are not going to get away witj anything that is not correct jail the fraudsters Are there Still People Who thinks Ramaphosa Is the way Forward Clearly You haven't heard about the ANC Fanctions It never captured my mind but there is nothing a minority can do but watch it go down hill "Malema is Zuma stepson they got rid of Mbeki so they can loot the country  "@Val Speirs that is the wrong discussion "i am doubtfull thiss fool is brushing his own ""tail""" Zuma is Malemas Pappa 
59:10,1:00:15, News: social media trending comment 2019 is: those who will vote the ANC again their lovers is cheating on them too but they don't care at all as long as they eat that fruit on bed. is Malema a Bantu or a Nilotic? and buy in china with BILLIONS of dollars Malema is a Zuma the ANC will take back the land without compensation and there is no reverse.

The ANC sent a delegation to the USA to ask for aid. SA is talking to the IMF and World Bank....What for? Check how much EU aid South Africa gets....and think again. 
1:04:11,1:05:17, @Val Speirs if you are impotent thats your problem.. They prefer to move the inauguration to Loftus than address how they are oppressing us "Val your pple had introduced HIV Magda Sequin does that mean you met all South Africans?🤔 @Derek main 😃😃😃🤦‍♀️ I know you would agree with me i accept that 😃😃 @Felix Muyoba yes and so will china own this country too as the alrady have 40 persent of our precios metels made in china via south african chinese Stupid question...next? No wonder commuter rail is so stuffed in SA - Transnet are too busy fixing other countries rail networks. Haha haha. Don't like the truth about the real cause of poverty 
1:05:31,1:07:35, I judge from the consistent errant male behaviour in SA @Cerebis the monies whic are in world bank and imf are contributions from all countries in the world..the problem is those institutions are are hijacked by the west @Yin Yang Yep - the ANC is corrupt to the core. A vote for them means more of the same. "@makhosi nobhatyi I would personally trust CR for the next 5 years "Please guys we still need each other @Thando Agree. And they shift as chair from one organisation to another and ever held accountable. @Felix Muyoba Nope you are wrong. Then this becomes just like Zimbabwe. Will you then eventualy take responsibillity for your own growth or who will be left to blame lets work together for a better South Africa "Power lies to the head 
1:07:43,1:10:37, "I lived in two other countries in Africa and visited twelve @Cerebis am right..thats why they are called world bank and international monetary fund else call them different names @makhosi nobhatyi i fully agree with you let us name the roaches off any kind the roaches they are jan piet gupta zuma all off them "I agree "@Cerebis I know that but that doesn’t mean president has to choose the rotten egg he will go over if the is no clean potato there many individuals in the Anc "Once the Commission writes its final report race Communist China owns South Africa economically Just look at the ANC's list and tell me that they are dealing with corruption. "@Felix Muyoba Wow 
1:11:06,1:14:05, When the ANC government can no longer pay its debt back to the Chinese they will invade. "Danie Nilsen it’s a new dawn "@makhosi nobhatyi We can only hope that if the ANC remain in control of SA @Cerebis Don't hold your breath - those are election time promises. @水戸水脈 are u an asian? "So I haven't seen any progress in the newly elected government in Zimbabwe. "The Anc is corrupt @Val Speirs ...and it won't be a noisy and visible invasion but a silent and invisible kind...And perhaps they've already started 
1:14:39,1:16:11, a The ANC owes communist China billions @Val Speirs how will you see progress if your fore fathers in the west are still holding on to the sanctions? @Derek Main Sad but probably true. CR has disappointed hugely with his forked tongue speeches depending on who he is addressing. Yes Derrick as they did to Mugabe in Zimbabwe and he literally wet his pants three times. "@Cerebis I trust the man voting tomorrow is the rammphosa new dawn and thuma mina with a corrupt list for the nezr 5 years i know i will miss my country @Cerebis And where was Cyril for the last 9 years?

E RUT there seems to be sh*it in all parties in your Country ANC - developmental or hard state model. Hugely successful in mainland Asia and SE Asia. But they get an F for implementation. Now skills are non existant in state and SOE's and corruption high. "werksman I am not optimistic re SA future.

Highly unlikely given the poltical fragmentation Get to the root of corruption it has nothing to do with the ordinary citizens of this country or Farms. HE WAS DEPUTY last 5 years under zuma hie teacher how it must be done put the whites in a pot of water and heat it uo slowly so they do not notice it until they are cooked Northwest province is watching in disgust when they see this man. This is the core problem of ruling party. recycling of leadership but what he actualy means put all your oponents into that pot @makhosi nobhatyi You seem like a fair man with huge confidence in CR? I hope and pray that he does not disappoint you....and South Africa! Cyril looks like a bull frog should he bee not in the pot He looks like he just came out of the boiling pot 🤣

1:48:50,1:50:04, Dont call us idiot Mzalwane Mzala just think if billion were not stolen how much more could be done @Andrew Mboweni The same people who are protesting poor service delivery will vote for the very party that has failed at service delivery. Go figure. @Peter Staffen More could have been done. only idiots will vote for a party with such a shabby record of delivery. If the ANC win and don't deliver we will come after the voters that voted them in power. @Joel Mzayidume Exactly Mzalwane Mzala but is what i said "She said 
1:50:10,1:51:45, @ Derek Main you are very offensive and i do not know what to say to you as you did not stand against john vorster and pw botha and fw de klerk to tell them apartheid was wrong ANC voters are accomplices to state capture.

The issue is that the thieves have just run rings around incompetent Boards and cronies deployed in the SOE's Andrew Mboweni we did stand up and had the referendum that changed everything "I am listening @E RUT Those boards were filled with cadres by the ANC. No wonder they were incompetent. anc are afraid that if another party wins ie DA in western cape the rest of the country anc will prove them wrong this is just not to fail to uplift poor south african but glorify the anc The ANC moved millions of families from shacks into houses. mzalwane mzala 30% mean the quality of education set up the youth for failure once they are out in the real world low comprehension and no skills "@Thami Ngwenya If you insist you are a better idiot than me
