Compliments I am seeing the Gerard Victor and the rest questioning the Dr's qualifications. On what basis? just because she is black?  Ja had some this morning  where girl with glasses from yesterday "@Herb Tuck now makes sense @Paul Amoomo You another prima donna? 
34:54,37:06, are cigarettes allowed? "@Paul Amoomo Its just curiosity. There had been people testifying that claim they are CA or Dr's very fishy sorry to say No it relaxes my brain  The race issue always gets raised as a last resort because there is no argument. She was in on the theft and crime at Eskom Have anyone questioned yours or the colour of your skin gave you privileges? To discuss race issues with you would be futile and waste of time "confusing @ take it up with Jan v Riebeeck or keep your opinions to yourself 
37:11,39:40, @Diana Louw no I like her at all "One day each isn't enough for Anoj ""Pinocchio"" Singh and Brian Molefe a.k.a Cry Baby" @Steve Lamb Agree. The honourable DOCTOR is not honest! @ meld melds just joking  @Paul Amoomo I did not cause or participate in state capture so my qualifications dont matter. But I see you are very sensitive to this. Just chill we all friends Playing stupid again. you do remember why are you lying? people must stop using race as an excuse!!! Ja well crime is classified by race in this country. everything is about race. "I am so sick of this race card being played. If you stole or assisted corruption 
40:11,43:39, @Paul Amoomo Because she is a woman  "@Minnib Prince We are all here together against corruption. But some completely miss it "We all know color and ""black"" people with their 30% is the problem. its about race." 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺JUST STOP "as much as we want to be logical OK @VigoSun its over now. Let it go @Fielies..I agree @VigoSun as much as you are ruled by your emotions who's the moderators i see about 200 racists in this chat 
43:40,46:27, Ok it's gone... Lol let's play house why don't we? 💤️ @Paul Amoomo I have a BA LLB and diplomas in Financial management.. Sometimes women are discriminated against becausethey are women Mooooooooove on DR is putting her self in a problem @Heather Durr and you think thats ok to discriminate @Minnib eita "No 
46:28,47:55, I have a disease...am I qualified enough🥴 BEE is a race based policy (apartheid in economics) "@Heather Durr "The devil might be in the detail. She might have left Eskom for the right reason "But what has race to do with corruption? we cannot when defeated in a discussion hide behind race. it's a fact "@Heather now I understand why I was forced to accept stones from Optimum on 25 April 2017 Who was behind issuing of relief penalties? "I posed a question 
47:58,51:11, (BEE) yes it is. It's years and the anc still have not closed the gap mxm. @Paul Amoomo Apologies-your English is not that clear.  ADSL on the blink again. Soon I will fire Telkom🥵 Morning @Lerato Moleke Nice to see you "@Heather Durr apology accepted @Paul Amoomo What does Amabhulu mean? Paul careful of the semantics Hey Louis C - how are you doing? How many KMs did you run during the holidays 🙃 "Ah same old story. Implementation is my responsibility. Formulation 
51:12,52:41, #Mkunto we Sizwe must fall @Lerato Moleke @Louis C Louis your running solo now with the level 3 Ana bhulu lol @ fail Paul hehe annalise lol that's a start. oops The bulls my people told me never to engage with land thieves @Lerato Moleke Ten times around the block every day....Then I put the block back under the bed 
53:27,54:31, @Paul-“your people” @Heather D - running solo incl. virtual races is the best thing ever for me. I don't miss the crowds at races  My people told me never to engage with state capture thieves  @Paul Amoomo Who are you engaging with now? I like your suit Ama Bhulu is not (The bulls) @annalie potgieter This one is trying to be semantically correct  @Paul Amoomo Who are your people? @Lerato Moleke Amazing what technology has taught us about ourselves during the lockdown I understand the frustration though. The same people in poverty vote the same crooks that don't implement jobs or lack the ability to make such changes. more like eat words not food. 
54:34,57:17, @Paul Amoomo there is no way to change a person's mindset on who that person wants to be. no debate will change that. a waste of time Vigosun excellent point  @Paul The Boer never stole land the British did "This page is same as enca now @Thinus Herselman. no fail. only a small mishap @ndlovu just block that's all Hi @lerato...it was me. .thx for the heads-up girlfriend ×× @ Paul amoomo how many jobs did your people create this year is koko gona testify also or how? 
57:32,58:35, back = bad why is the language Afrikaans the only language in the entirty of the whole world with part of the continent name in the language name non of you Unbelieving infidels will be able to anser it Adv Seleka asks her such a damning question with such directness @Nkosingiphile just 'loadshed' on what vexes your soul  Comon chat can we atleast pretend to stand togher against corruption? Even for just a few hours? Theres lots of space on facebook and twitter to take on race issues the bushman where here first then the ships came to Africa @Herb Tuck why don't YOU find out how many jobs were created? "@Valencia Second that @FieliesSA .  
58:41,1:00:25, Diane no. africans were manipulated and lacked means to defend themselves. They simply brought a gun to a spear fight. I prefer the RPG "let me leave this chat for now. It's 31 degrees here just tuned in . who is the ANC dog in the hot seat. Yes but now africans own RPGs aw she seems like a nice lady @dee dee cocroft I cant wait for Koko @dee dee cocroft Hey there 
1:00:27,1:02:02, Makes me believe that we far from a solution. @Diane Louw The Khoi-Akhoi & the Mgani-Sun & the Hottentots & the Voorttrekkee was in South africa 100 years prior to the British captin Jan van riebeek working on a dutch ship arived ur History is BS Im glad Vigo so we can use them in the future She's got a Dr's qualification in looting and corruption? Lol diane 90/10 % I don't like those odds. another ANC looting dog @Herb Tuck im not interested otherwise i would have. not because my brain is too relaxed. "this lady reading the script "@Valencia 
1:02:14,1:04:50, She mentions Glencore once and Zondo rushes to move on😂😂😂 Koko the Clown must fry! "The British enlish Colinized South africa The Boer where here before that and where settelers only not colinizers like the british @Power Electronics Thanks for the history lessons. But you can let it go now. we have moved on @Santa Kriel Christmas is gone we don’t need a SANTA FOR NOW Temporary relief was granted to Tegeta 🤔 but some were fined 😴. sorry il call it a scunk surely people who give evidence should have their facts straight @nkosingiphile ndlovu I think she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. But she did act biased and that bodes ill for her 
1:05:46,1:08:58, @dee dee cocroft you mean skunk? from WHO at coal operations...? I think she was not vigilant enough to know. she was doing her job to the best of her ability. not... "@FieliesSA @Diane Louw That's why the truth is always best-much as it may implicate you. When the EL comes back at you later with a / related to that aspect and you have been lying your answer will make no sense question @Gerard Victor what has Grade to do with anything My age is the same as my birth year × by my birth month × by my birth date the sum of each individual number counted togeth = my Age 100 % agree Heather  
1:09:43,1:12:33, i have blocked him  skunk ANC love to steal . they love . they loveee to steal . and yet the ANC fools still vote for them . eish if only .must be cool to be brainless. hullo @FieliesSA that doesnt even know the true history of SA but believes a majority that gives another naritive haha I am blocking him as well @FieliesSA i blocked him also @Power Electronics looks like you happy the British went around the world stealing countries  Tea Time beer plz

Zuma and his cronnies deserved to be prosecuted 
1:16:13,1:18:26, @Eric every one of them. Disgusting parasites. @Santa Kriel please forgive me Why is the tailor making orange overalls so slow? "lol SA miniral rights all of it has already been sold to china back in 1996 south africa has the worlds largest GOLD depisit in the entirety of the world but doesnt own the mine legaly anymore "so @FieliesSA is a racist but not people who do not know the facts call people from the anc skunks? sorry "Commission of enquiry have the same job as the court Zuma usenabantu abamesekayo abanenkungu emehlweni @Santa Kriel Huh?

1:22:27,1:25:19, ...No one claimed a need for coal excpt the investors abroad in ESKOM. what happened to Zuma? he's no longer coming here? ANC will soon fall because it cant even pay its own municpal cadas and so the cadas will turn on eachother @VigoSun We call it the Amoeba Effect. One part cant move without the rest softning and moving with it. Just like these crooks patric the comission was instigated by julias malema himself @Power Electronics spot on! Yeah there are two meaning to monopoly money which most will miss or use. eff eff eff eff eff maaaaaan viva @Kevin MQ the DCJ still has to make an announcement on that "DCJ she is correct 
1:25:23,1:27:08, Zondo is getting stuck in useless technicalities. so who left the coal in the rain? and then if you acuse a black person the race card gets played do anyone even know what Racist means it means someone who feels that another race is supurior to another the one who feels so is Racist @Power Electronics That's a myth. The comm came about thanks to Prof Madonsela. Bless her! "how do you come to a conclusion that the commission is a waste thanks Eric @FieliesSA im not going to split no this commission is not a waste of money seems like some ANC skunks are upset .there thieving days are coming to an end You welcome Kevin

1:29:41,1:31:11, @dee dee cocroft somebody must have hurt you real bad to be so nasty "the draw wasn't a true reflection but fine  All state owned companies were milking cows for crocks who claim to be ANC members. it's just unfortunate that the so called struggle stalwarts looked away💔😭 So the commission is biased with Glencore.😉 @Power Electronics Alcoholics Anonymous for everyone The quality of the chat has hit an all time low today.

2:22:14,2:27:31, "...The contracts are guilty of corrupting SAfrica No clean draft agreement!! What were the legal specialists at Eskom doing Surely this should have been in place. i c 2 "'Because 1.'.. what about 2.

2:29:40,2:32:13, my thoughts too Sal SA these grammatical error contracts should be illegal @Danielle yes she is from a distance "Danile Ngubenyathi in sesotho @Louis C Yes they do but with a Proviso that it must be paid back if they are found to have been naughtee @Diane Louw. Not necessarily from my non-legal experience oh love that giggle from dCJ ...Allowing a foreign entity/ person to control a President's duties is a self inflicted wounding....... @pius mooi van vir

These contracts must bread n butter issues louis I snd I alone agree exactly why not correct it before sending it out "at poem a agree with danile @bruinman Other races don't lie?? "all departments concerned travesty of whatever 
2:40:59,2:43:01, Bandwidth and attention span very low @Louis C I very much doubt it as they basically sit and listen-maybe it is negotiated she just inferred that Eskom's legal dept is dumb & don't read contracts before issuing them hello my friends from soth africa Rush for Koko to sign i suppose @bruinman seriously? in this day and age on a public platform...this thinking still exists? south @Heather Durr Ta' Sexy world

2:44:37,2:46:21, tony ran a lucrative sheheen and had celebrity guests like gigaba and molefe as well as zwane and ace Sexy And yesterday she said she was annoyed because she was lured to Sexy world under false pretenses. Yet she goes again. I think to collect a parcel shebeen concede how can there be trust after the first meeting with Tony as she told us yesterday. She had to have more dealings with him!! Went alone - brown envelope for sure shebeen that served curry ask hlaudi Was Zuma's son their colleague in Dubai born by then

Come to Durbs for the best bunny chow "Ok Lady "It's a pity she didn't have a driver - Gigaba's driver spilled the beans on bags of money so she trusted the guptas and not the people she works with eisch for sure Heather sal u are right but uncle tony had luxury bunny and free 
2:48:07,2:49:30, Adv ask her how much she received @Diane Louw SNAP @Diane Louw the nerve of this lady Trust Me; The * Brothers G * Knew EXACTLY Of The Intellectual Capability Of The Political Stooges They Were Dealing With and Simply Carried On Accordingly; With Benefit Over Benefit Accruing ... ! wandy its shocking and maybe thats why she was suspended for meetings behind the companies back. after her meeting with uncle tony she started a vet koek shop with her daughter @Kevin Davis Luxury? hehehehe. Those buggers where Vegetarians "@Kevin. These Gupta crooks are from India @Kevin Davis Sax bunny. Whole loaf stuffed with R200 notes

She just can't say. if you are concerned you will be out on limb have the meeting in you office under your control even sit your sec in on the meeting to take notes  you dont buy vetkoeks at your neighbour's house unless you tell your daughter what's wrong with your own vetkoeks Thank you SABC for having a live chat.

"Fire for lack of trust this lady always paid her traffic fines with her Austin Martin something Sean Connery failed to do

Zondo's breathing sound bites. heheheheheheh He needs to loose weight. 
2:56:57,2:58:03, "Too late "@Heather Durr One "She could have just said but then you stated at the company and continued to work there - come clean lady plse.... stated = stayed  the science Ceryl Spews comes from his own head not the Who No one feels safe with so much cash on their person this lady is obviously upset that her vetkoek spaza made her clients edgy and did not want meetings anywhere but at uncle tony shebeen Lee.D.Hendrix why state of emergency be imposed by President
