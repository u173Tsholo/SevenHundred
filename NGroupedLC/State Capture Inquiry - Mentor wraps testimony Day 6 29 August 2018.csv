time,4:16,message I am certain that this witness will boost my confidence in this inquiry after a disappointing two days testimony from the previous one. note its still early more than 30 witness are lined up. So one or two should not spell doom. Possible Former Minister Mbalula will take podium this afternoon so as Pull a Williams "Others on the are current and former ministers Yaaa neh... @Thiza William We are now about to start. Sello woman again 😩😩 Mental case is such a drama queen. State capture is fake 
5:46,9:10, my lady Mentor I was ur body guard last night Jackson Mpala idiots like you should actually keep your thoughts to yourself as you are brain dead Thank you for your service Noko. you r welcome Mr Venter Kazi yozala nkomonina Morning All getting interesting hey when are Gupta and Zuma taking the stand why only the Boers are so excited at Mentors fake testimonies 
9:49,13:15, Lol @Jackson Mpala Already she is contradicting herself I dont think Mentoor is lying they all lie Hi ALL "this is a smokescreen Why did she need to consult for her to maintain her statement if she telling the truth Le izophuma nodlolwazana "Why would she lie 
13:38,17:27, "fat lady needs a few years in jail "Usis’Mentoor lo ubetha abanqandelwayo @le roux dont be so quick 2make that judge @ Ganasan last time i checked your girlfriend was fat Jackson Mpala because we see the truth and not lies that your people tell under oath I see all these hearings and enquiries but no prosecutions. It's just a massive waste of time and money and to fool the ppl to think we dont like corruption "She was fired klk lonto ezityand'igila She thought it was going to end o facebook. On facebook she is a sensation and big celebrate amongest the boers because the goal is to weaken the ANC and strengthen the DA Le Roux - the ANC is the African National Corruption party led by Cyril who made millions from government contracts 
17:45,18:57, Stealing is stealing "@jean I can't wait for Zuma to take the stand! @le roux bye man and stop waisting our time the demeanour says it all. a spade needs to be called a spade Phof Zuma is too much of a coward he'll never risk cross examination! The boers gave her large sums of money to lie about the state Our Country is about to be removed on some People 's hand. is interesting. 
19:07,20:45, You're talking nonsense Jackson! do you think guys is making up all this??/ Jackson Mpala prove it idiot JZ and his son will do well in jail She's not like Zuma who sold our country fora plate of curry! they belong in jail thando - looks like she eats a trucklaod of curry every day DA dometsic workers and gardeners are braiwashed to defend their masters "To my perspective 
20:59,22:55, "@jean if these people can just call malema to sort out this whole thing will take him only one day Marvel I fully agree with you "@Millicent Shozi  Mandela's legacy - a party and government that is corrupt thru n thru. He must be turning over in his grave @Thabo Kganyago I think at least 52million ppl in SA think that most Zumas and Mandela's son must be in jail to me this state capture will expose the whole ANC. it is clear that zuma was captured and mentor and company are using that to fight their own battles. This makes me questio the intelligece of Madonsela "@ganasan 
22:55,23:53, "eyesight??????why must she read Do they not fear their lives ? who wouldnt be nervouse on this spot? Jz nd dudu can't wait to see them at Matatshe prison' "Jackson Mpala you have no intelligence  So even if she is lying she is BRAVE! "fat people are a blight on society. Lazy body Now she claim eye sight but she is ever chatting on facebook "Mpala! our challenge in the country is that we allow many to get away with a lot of things 
24:01,25:25, @le roux you racist "@Jackson Mpala  madonsela was never fired Fakey is back. day 3 "I understand why she's nervous The anc government should be ashsmed of what they have done to this country. corruption everywhere Is she wearing the exact same ring that vyltjie was wearing yday?? !??! "kganyago 
25:50,27:32, i dont understand why would people protect corrupt people just because they belong to their race Lorna - agree 100%. ANC has destroyed your lovely country "@J Ganasa 🤣🤣Zynab sold our country for a of curry 🍛 "@peter pott  yes i agree with u jz and his son they must report them self in jail This country is not destroyed @Ganasan - May I kindly suggest that you withdraw your view about full bodied people. I don't think it's Ayoba my guy. Zuma also had to manipulate NPA by appointing someone who will delay prosecutions of top officials..Shaun Abrams..that's why he had to address the parliament over pending prosecutions of top officials you stole our land yes rot in jail 
27:38,30:57, why are there no white ppl implicated in this state capture? or are there? "this lady is causing unintended job losses to many people. now the commissioner of oath is losing his licence. yesterday Those companies Mckanzie It’s really sad to see ppl who r articulate themselves so poorly being our so called leaders/mp’s @Marvel - ok I withdraw my statements about obese people. Their choice to be fat. My apologies "kganyago! No "Clearly She said she does not know where the place is and now she knows where it is and that is not an issue🙆🙆🙆 j ganasan i think its unfair what you saying bra 
31:26,34:55, why is it unfair. pls enlighten me "really admire this chair the chair is absolutely great "@Thando somebody must just rot in jail and that's all "We are all confused here "at sipho magoro trust me bra...she's scared nd being manipulated by da governor. so there is any fact dat is she telling da country truth "Sipho "@Thando 
35:08,36:40, LOL . . . "she is not articulating her responses well but I do believe she is truthful. but if this was a court "@Maanda true dat sir...bt let m tell u dis one step at a time pls jizzzyyyyy.....!! bobstaa I agree we have never had a. commission that true Thando...we must learn that papers don't define who we're...money...certificates....etc.... waste of taxpayers money. just jail the bastards zuma and gupta's and seize all their assets .... the commission is a serious affair. alot is at stake to get to the truth. Many poor people are suffering because of state capture. Mentor'plz don't be afraid by last day 
37:20,40:42, "@Thando @lorna who are those people? "Mentor is a talkative woman @Jackson ur right bra.. i dont know what is really happening just wana be sure did this lady ever jole with msholozi some other people will loose their lives thru this....really What a BEAUTIFUL land we have eaten and destroyed by dirty Scavengers with their dirty paws! besides that we walk on eggshells on what we say how we say it everything is taken in the wrong context. white and black people who cannot get work. The cost of living is very high and so are taxes. Fuel is exhorbitant. Eskom electricity is incredibly high. Food ... everything and everybody is affected u jilwe fela.. 
40:56,43:48, "the old man is so bored in that chair "Billions of taxpayers abused and looted "so i just started following the inquiry Look up ted gowdy and his inquiries. People do go to jail and understand it isnt a friendly chat Steinhoff is in parliament today😕😕😕😕are we ever get the country alright though? "the chair could do with a weight loss program too. all these government fat cats living off the taxpayer I dont know. Not even there. I plan on working in SA on power generation projects after graduation though fat like you Ganasan "But if companies have so much control over government 
44:15,46:11, I am shocked Zondo removes glasses to see clearly The poor zondo.....is confused hahahahahaha "This ganasan has something psychologically wrong the chair sounds like he's a bit slow witted The commission is going to take a lot of taxpayers money. The criminals were supposed to be jailed long time ago. Who's the next witness ? "why didn't Thuli Put some respect on Zondo's name. He is the Deputy Chief Justice for cry sake. Respect him. or is Mentor on the entire day ? 
47:32,51:01, Zondo the clown - ANC cronie - how did he ever get the job Someone please kindly update me? Where do we stand? Where we stand is Mentor lied to the nation and must be jailed Yawn 😩😩 @ Louw join the revolutionary movement than you will know where you stand "Sheridan - Mentor lied and is trying to bullshit her way out of it. Zondo is clearly out of depth 😐 Ganasan you are a moron. Its the job of the DCJ to listen attentively to witnesses as the Chairperson of the commission. But they are now wasting our time with their confusion 
52:08,55:32, ningaqali ezenu i commission of inquiries nje kuba kubonakala ngathi ezona dedicated advocates nini aba Gosana "you see "please no Zulu here J .G Zuma + shaaber Shake = Gupta's brothers Mentor is now denying her own statement. que pass aquu? "This chat was flowing precisely until people such as Ganasan started body shaming other people. it's just not fair. let's try to be accomodative just a waste of time live Zuma alone coz he is really untouchable Ganasan apologized nje 
55:48,58:08, Yes I did apologize 😞 I missed it what did you say "hai uyawgaya umuthi msholozi CONFUSED...... Lol advocate is really confused now. "Millicent no guys i think they trying to prove that hawks fiddled with her statements and changed them since those papers were with the hawks CONFUSION Galore!!! bored

This inquiry is a waste of time. They are going to use time and dates to defend the culprits. There is no case Jackson Mpala ucabanga ukuthi uyini But guys do u trust Mentor? true hey its a waste of time "@peter pott u just made it Crystal brother
