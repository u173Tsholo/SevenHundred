Wa jus saying before the wheels fell of I never believed this scripted pandemic from WHO for one second and the slightest research confirms my opinion. @Santa Kriel hi Hi @Santa Kriel WHO changed their procedures in 2009 to allow them to decree a pandemic without due scientific process. @santa kriel one family on nation just amazed at how our taxes were and still squandered😀😀😀

Yoh "@Teunis wat gaan aan the cheek! "Yup its slow hey 
22:18,24:13, @Santa Kriel better debating issues than defering to arbitrary self proclaimed authority like Fauci and WHO? what's up with the slow mode? they are censoring us so they can monitor our communication here. Why do we have to be slower and wait 31 seconds to send next message🙄 something sinister lurking. Can't keep up with the A-team 😂😂 @Anne M....corruption at its best make me depressed "corruption is a pandemic "@Teunis fgfd @Valencia J ek is net verstom Valencia ons moet leer staaaaaadiger😁😁

32:24,33:35, I wonder who is this person is going correct all these wrong doings from the ANC.Because it's clear now that everybody there is corrupt. This proves the smallanyana skeletons. I wish if zondo commission can stay forever and to investigate everything. it can play a role in order to reduce the corruption @Valencia J as long as companies are benefiting ANC is sadly going nowhere. Wolfy dankie ek nodig tee wragtig "people that continue to defend the anc are fools "Bathabile Dhlamini said it ""All of us have that smallanyana skeleton""! this is what she meant:elbowcough:" @ALTA me too. BRB coffee break. Well the ANC will have to rename the criminal party to ..The New ANC..and carry the true spirit of Nelson Mandela . we need the number for asking donation please

I was just wondering if SABC or YOutube controls the Slow Mode feature which I have seen before. @Magesh Difa dont you mean behind his nose boring now. m sleeping. Are the kids still waiting for Blade or have they left? 
40:24,40:55, @Alta...yesssss we can read all the messages and listen. .lol @Aubrey De Bliquy The almighty Google commands all ! 😀 @Aubrey De Bliquy and @Naledi Barron .

41:27,42:57, After this membership numbers are going to decrease 🤞 @Pastor J.J Please don't! LOL!! Chat is slowed to help us concentrate on the testimony instead of on comments of people who seem to treat this commission as a dating service. @bongile sango start the word "@Teunis van Ree That was the Grade 6 class entertaining us this morning. Nothing to do with Mr Blunt ""not so sharp"" Blade" "Hmm Google Our students causing chaos for a second day ...Here's a way out.....10 Countries That Will Pay You To Move There....to make more citizens. who was implicated today 
43:03,44:23, and no doubt now controlled by entities in the permanent state oligarchy. @peter sikoshule the ANC @Terrance....the fat ones must have high cholesterol and high BP.... @Pastor J.J 👍😂 007 lol @Valencia J Look at the comments while listening to the testimony. It's clear that most commentators have very little interest in what the witness is saying. Valencia i agree ANC = bloody corruption you dont eat other peoples money and remain healthy 
44:50,48:04, @Dominic Przybylski we are networking 😀 Agrizz "@Dominic. Chill bro @Teunis van Ree 😂😂🤣🤣 @Rahab 😂😂😂they can't be healthy at all Any news on the consitutional court urgent hearing to oblige Mr Zuma to testify like every South African called upon is obliged to testify? 😴😴😴😴😴 "@Sal SA I'm very chilled Why does a government with a majority to change laws have to break laws to deliver services? Incompetence? Greed? Betrayal? 
48:05,49:17, @Dominic Przybylski The Dating in the chat was being run as a side bus for a fee. Now that you have given it prominence you have denied @Valencia J and the A Team of our only source of income. hahaha How can people be so stupid leaving this Wizard of Oz road leading to them This is shocking. The tender is awarded to who??? @Minnib Prince i can drink my tea see the chats and type inbetween now as well ... beginning to like slow mode😂😂 "@Aubrey still awaiting the outcome @Dominic Przybylski I can relate - this morning's invasion was epic! P****ed me off no end! Hello stranger. Where've you been? @Roza E ramaphosa was correct anc is accused no 1 himself included @Roza E Greetings prettiest one

Jeff Jeff Jeff🤣🤣🤣 I always asked my self how did they became a millionaire over a stipend they received from the party. @Roza E hi hi Anne Pastor missed u alot @Alta..I like it too...can listen and read and chat...multi task. ......hope @Dominic sees my mess...lol @thando he is the commission investigator i think @Rahab Takalo I doubt the court will not agree with Zondo. This is not even a grey area. It is clear Zuma did not even present a case for recusal. @Roza E You too my Bestie 
50:27,51:08, @Dominic. i was fortunate to meet @Naledi @Alta in this chat. Problem is I'm still negotiating with my bank to pay the lobola hi @Roza E 🌷 Why on EARTH would you steal money using EMAILS... 😨 "@thando cezula EOH paying ""donations"" for conferences etc." @Rob ... you nailed it😂😂 "you will be subjected to ""Eppergenitics"" if you eat of the negativities  @Sal SA Awwww. LOL!! Theunis hi there The commission investigators must go to Nelson Mandela Bay Metro. The rot there is beyond repairs.

55:29,57:23, ALTA @Roza E greetings the christmas goodies must come to an end I C U @Roza E @Cruda Bex hi there "Yes ok ive got red lines on mine "the son has got the mother to use her bank account . don't be surprised if she gets bumped off before she testifies hy would people thinkj the EF would be any better? Juju used his base to elect Zuma and then to bring him down. How is he to be trusted as more than just another self serving parasite? 
57:28,59:26, This means next year there won't be any January 8. Because donations will be gone "@ALTA @Pastor J.J do you guys se me "correctional centres must be increased @Roza E slow mode on hi there @SanFran Arnold I see you clearly with my old eyes Darling Hello @Roza E DOn't thin I saw you earlier ANC must give all this money back @Pastor J.J :virtualhug::virtualhug: lovely eyes "@Minnib Prince they have no money to give back 
59:28,1:00:42, "Let's vote DA the whole Country i'd rather live in zimbabwe than vote DA @Aubrey.....ja sorry I forgot they bankrupt. ..lol I think we scared @Dominic away. "@Minnib Prince "one of zuma's daughter said the whole ANC must go to jail with his father "@thando cezula I see so @Manelisi Lol @Cruda Bex i greeted you earlier but slow mode on 
1:00:50,1:02:27, @3RDCREWTEK be patient you may get your wish. @Manelisi mnguni how do you know that DA is clean? "better that than DA shame What is PMO guys? @Yolo....I forgot for a min they bankrupt....hahaha is it the same Laher from Trasnet? "@SalSA Depends on the context. For me LOWER Class Citizens must stop breaking school Windows.. I'm well thank you Queen B! How are you? 
1:02:28,1:03:23, @Granny Mokwena absolutely 100%. The cANCer has bankrupted the country. They went straight for the business hub of SA and just went on a looting spree. How do they still get away with this? @Sanfran Arnold can you see me @Naledi Barron correct @Minnib Prince unless they sell Luthuli House. @bongile sango I know the DA is as expedient as all politicians with perhaps a little more style. I certainy do not trust their policies as adequate to our challenges. Thanks @Heather @Sal SA Programme or:Poject Management Office i almost believed his Transnet testimony @Pastor J.J 
1:03:26,1:05:54, DA @ALTA Ek sien vir jou my vriendin @Granny Mokwena The same buggers that appeared at Treasury when Weekend Special was appointed Minister Any action against Dudu Myeni commission's misconduct. @Yolo...they will have to..lol....ooh but maybe they not even paying rent/bond so they can't sell We have more than enough competent and qualified black people with the necessary integrity and moral fortitude but they are not welcome in the centers of power. Where is their political home? ...DID ZUMA SELL or BARTER NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION to anyone BY ALLOWING PARTICULAR PLANES TO LAND ON A MILITARY BASE.? DCJ but does chair understand 'Freudian slip' @Minnib Prince You could be right with Kakhuis Niehaus being in the same building 
1:05:54,1:07:02, in the state capture inquest zumas behaviour was predictable Bliquy:goodvibes: @Heather Durr I am very sure that he does. @Heather Durr I'm sure he does LOL! DA "@SanFran Arnold I like him very much fvck DA Lock up Dudu myeni..She is corrupt @Heather Durr I think he does. I find him to be very articulate and intelligent 
1:07:21,1:08:28, @Aubrey I can understand if he says it's better than the others. because as a person who is staying in CT. things are coming too slow to my place. "I met a few of these people .they are wearing g .asks and hiding behind it and I see through their masks and look at the cars "@Yolo More yes he is wonderful @3RDCREWTEK I beg your pardon?? It seems we are now getting the forensic experts and the cream of the crop of advocates. @Pastor J.J Niehaus is nie 'n kakhuis nie. Dont trust DA..Also dont trust EFF as they were previously in a coalition with DA beg who's pardon DA has ran the Western Cape very well and ANC has ran the rest very corruptly. 
1:08:30,1:09:35, "@Aubrey De Bliquy yes @3RDCREWTEK Your typing error of course! "@Canis. Kakhuis Niehuis is vrot @Rob 10/10 "@Naledi Barron in 2016 when Hillary said I beg your pardon I doubt DA has run western cape well .Look at Gugulethu and langa "yes .their are plenty of the cream of the crop people "from 63 rands in the account to millions of rands "This is why the cANCer wanted Tshwane so bad 
1:09:48,1:11:05, "so all you minions who always say the corrupt is Zuma and the Guptas "DA & ANC are right Normally only block eff trolls but experimented with blocking the dating agency small-talkers. Amazing how much space just a few of them took up. gugulethu and langa is a refelcrion of how DA sees lower class citizens in this country LOL @Aubrey De Bliquy ! @Cain Chunda they are getting there. The evidence leader said so in his opening remarks if you listened. ANC is the home of thugs @Sal SA orange are now big fashion 😁😁 most vote anc to get in on the criminal activities. 
1:11:59,1:14:23, how can we trust any led government by anc when members of its party seems to be so involved in dubious transactions between EOH and how the company looted the state getting where Arnold? "this is the begining of a failed state or it has startef already ANC is supposed to be te home of the Freedom Charter. We want our home back. and the land which is our birthright as South Africans. They should do this for every company !!!!!!!! "yes Aubrey @Aubrey De Bliquy. What are you talking about??? @Aubrey you want your apartheid back? @Kopz Koape Our constitution is supposed to be a fulfilment of the Freedom Charter. That ideal is still to be realized. 
1:14:28,1:15:17, "Yes Aubrey I wonder what the ratio is between actual corruption and just being bad at your job ... atm it seems most in this commission are both :{ Herman Mashabe is useless... he is just another politician... ex anc "Aubrey said ""All South Africans""" Let him explain Nkosi... Aubery... how do you mean exactly? @Aubrey De Bliquy Unfortunately ideals are often confused with illusions. @Minnib Prince very relaxing this slow mode hey sis😁😁 "Aubrey is right @Nkosi Welcome that is not what he was saying. You must read with understanding. He was saying we as South Africans 
1:15:22,1:18:03, GTI 7 must go and arrest ANC Us mean all of us. I do not subscribe to te fantasy of group guilt or group pprosperity. We are one nation. We swim or sink together. United we stand. Divided we fall. @Aubrey de Bliquy. The freedom charter does have flaws such as SA is for all who live in it . Illegal immigrants take advantage of that. "South Africa belongs to al those who live in it I never cease to be amazed how people spend money on Data just to come on here and behave foolishly. Eish I disagrees with the idea that the anc is the home criminals it's not @Kopz Koape Exactly. If we have no borders we have no country. @Alta.....yep Even the powerful Soviet Union wasn't able to convert the illusion of the same ideal into a reality. If they failed what makes you think a small underdeveloped country like ours will succeed? 
1:18:08,1:19:34, chair we cant hear you @Heather Durr I had a look at this guys company website.. interesting stuff. did the commission hire them? ANC IS ROTTEN TO THE CORE South africa is the only country that is boderless "Im not against immigrants coming to SA @Alta. ..I am now even cutting up veggies as well. ....lol When is DCJ announcing a decision on Dudu Myeni? @Mbulelo Zitha May I ask. What has the ANC done for you and its people vs. what we hear they did for themselves? @Minnib Prince😂😂😂 
1:19:39,1:22:18, ...The NPA could supply employment for the youth. The paper-trails of stolen money go back for years and centuries. Some foriegners can stay as long as they abide by law and do the right thing and contribute to economy by creating employment and investment "@Kieron Sinewave You mean ENS-They were hired by EOH BUT we need a forensic audit on all SOE's that are raised here-it gives the answers  @Kopz Koape Yes. If 1000 pupils enter the borders there must be two extra schools for their pupils if they are not to be second class ciizens without the right to education we all have. @thando cezula the matter is already on its way to the courts glim and glamour at the expense of tax payers monies 🤔🤔 R617.77 someone has been looking at my bank statement it seems @Aubrey De Bliquy indeed. Infrastructure is needed for the influx of people. But we know that the cANCer cannot provide it @Pastor J.J 😂😂 
1:22:40,1:26:56, hypocrisy is when anc tell us white companies are bad for us and then blackmailing the same companies into corruption in the name of protecting them from angry masses DCJ well done on joining the dots there. Important. @Heather Durr riiiiight @Sanfran Arnold i agree "What's going here This is the reason our beloved country is on it's knees @Aubrey De Bilquy..Im thinking perhaps the government should deploy soldiers to all the borders especially porous borders. Perhaps SANDF can establish barracks near borders and patrol borders Yours in democracy:elbowcough::elbowcough: ppl were thriving on corruption 
1:27:24,1:31:11, It is so wonderful to see Arthur Chaskalson's son continuing his father's services to SA - by helping DCJ Zondo to see the extent of the cancer in this land. Stength to them all - and thanks. @Kopz Koape that is what commandos used to do @Ismail Petersen no just orange will do for corrupt people @Kopz Koape as long as there is no bribery to allow people to buy their way into the country ... but I guess that applies to all borders. THe immigration authorities need to be fixed. """LAN and WAN"" gives as much detail as invoicing for ""IT"". There is no measurable deliverable." Sekhakane should learn a thing or two And people wonder why Joburg’s IT billing system is dysfunctional "@Aubrey De Bliquy..I agree "@Grant Herholdt It's a historical issue 
1:31:43,1:34:58, @Kopz Koape We need body cams on our politicians more urgently. @Kopz Koape that is a brilliant idea - they should do this with our cops and also with our civil servants. And since then neither SAP or EOH can fix it despite getting paid bajillions for doing just that. @Kopz Koape Wise leadership is so vital. @Grant Herholdt Exactly!! And therin lay the opportunities for such graft and c orruption to have taken place over the last 15+ years! "@Antony and@ dominic. Yes this lahers name seems to be cropping up all tge time "@Aubrey. I dont think ill see wise leadeship in this lifetime @Kopz Koape Lol. No government anywhere would support political transparency. That's why it's so important to get Frog Boiler to sign the political party donation legislation into law. 
1:35:33,1:38:20, Makhubo must go straight to jail. makhubo destroyed south Africa @Roza E Laher and Bobhat was the 2 that went to Treasury When Des Van Rooyen was appointed Minister of Finance for the dreaded weekend "Please do not accept the excuses the so called ""leaders"" are given. They were aware of the PFMA BOOM BOOM BOOM!!! millions @Dominic.. Right corruption is everywhere but not like SA. Corruption has reached biblical proportions..Its out of control and it will destroy this country..SA could become a failed state anytime now millions millions @SanFran Arnold I was fooled by his humbleness😄. I never expected him to be a tsotsi. 
1:38:20,1:40:15, these were illicit flow of money this is scary @Heather Durr They got paid for licences not delivered or wastefully delivered strengthening democracy. ..se voet this people must be accountable individually not collectively "@Kopz Koape South Africa is already a failed state. 5th most dangerous in the world why is not one of them in jail?? @Pastor J.J 🤔 this Bobhart is the weekend special's advisor/COS. "@Fred 
1:40:16,1:42:19, @Dominic..Then its reached a point of no return if its reached failed state status pay back the money the anc is well insulated from prosecution they had 10 years to prepare for this moment so I dont think much is going to come from this only minions will go to jail true @Karen x Thanks-I just cannot get my mind around how much they paid for nothing-its mindblowing @Kopz Koape I don't see when or how it can return to anything like success considering all circumstances. Our only hope is that the private sector will be able to keep the economy running. well im just flabbergasted "@Tongai Mupedzi Heather you clearly not following the proceedings... just typing 
1:43:09,1:46:08, "bomb after bomb after bomb and yet the ANC continues to win elections @Karen x no need to be nasty to some 1 "@Heather Durr @Karen x Heather has been around on this forum for as long as many of us have. Her distinction is her career as a lawyer. So please wind it back? @Rob yes like i always say 1 2 3 bye bye karen x @Mr L. what I see the problem is there is no party which are serious for ruling SA "these monies were just looted while empty promises were made to poor people still using pitlatrines and asbestos roofs @Dominic sad but true I never think SA they are corrupt like this...I think SA is number one for corruption in Africa is a xeim 
1:46:12,1:47:51, @Yolo More - Hi not the same Bobat - that one was a Mohammad @Phakamile Khuzwayo The primary responsibilty of a government is to maintain law and order. Our government is a criminal syndicate. We don't have a real government. We have to survive without one. Yup block all who have a point to prove due to their own inferiority complexes @Karen x we need clean audit in all municipalities for us to be on the right direction Pastor sorry just saw ur reply now so those were the weekend specials @Jenny B thanks my love. I agree DA was going a right direction until they started to mess up of removing black leaders "@Kauja..Its almost as bad as Zimbabwe 
1:48:02,1:49:28, Awww all my dear friends :thanksdoc: "@Kauju Mwakajumba I agree @Heather Durr always @Heather Durr NP @Heather Durr 🌷🌷🌷 For now as much as ANC are more corrupt i don’t see any party which is serious in SA We're all boiled frogs of all races in the ANC potjie. municipal are beyond corrupt @Tommy Kernaghan Groan 😂 
1:49:33,1:52:03, @PastorJJ - Hi did you see that Dudu's lawyer pick up the same as I did. @dominic pryzbyliski ppl feel like they are sellouts if they have to remove the anc they rather suffer from their own then providing the best for their grandchildren @Jenny B Yes my friend. I watched it again on Monday and noticed Since constitution will be changed to individual to compitite as a president then that will be much better @Minnib Prince 🙂 @Kauju Mwakajumba That makes sense. @Phakamile Khuzwayo We have to rely on ourselves as individuals rather than be herded (as the masses) like cows towards an abbatoir. Ha ha! The ANC Money-Go-Roundabout fame. "EOH has more corrupt deals than Denel 
1:52:47,1:53:29, "@Pastor J.J - so she was not a witness @Dominic Przybylski 100% No matter the credentials of the authority. Trust but verify. did he just say Geoff will be here on Friday "@Dominic..One way the citizens can tackle the porous border is managing Limpopo river where illegals from zim cross into SA "friday is going to be another ""FEAR OF INCRIMINATING MYSELF ""🤣😂🤣😂" *game I think Mr Makube will go and visit pastor Bushiri before Friday:elbowcough: @Sherwin Peters yes @Aubrey De Bliquy Why cant they do forensic audits for all the SOEs-should they not have started with that . Too expensive?

"@Aubrey De Bliquy Google her - very attractive Only prime minister who impresses me is Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand. here is the cases where people are.directly.implicates through documentary evidence as oppose to the likes of Aggrizzi ...The USA is born again. 
2:12:09,2:15:46, @Yolo More I am sure there are many Zondo's around with a sense of patriotism and faithful to the country. Agrizzi provided documentary and video evidence @Innocent Mthembu . Don't let his racism blind you to the information he provided the commission. Everyone summoned to appear at the zondo commission has sold his/her soul @AubreyDe Bliquy are you a pastor? Rwanda and Botswana are the least corrupt countries in Africa ANC fools most people by using race to stay in power. "@Heather Durr. Not impressed with Nicky Haley positions in foreign policy this race card doesn't feed us and we must wake up @Sal SA I agree totally-but country may be ready for a republican woman and she has experience. Give her 8/12 years 
2:15:47,2:22:53, @Kauju Mwakajumba ot a pastor. That was a fancy dress on my facebook page. LOL lots of eople ask that. But I am profoundly spiritual. I don't like religious fundamentalism detached from reality. @Sal SA Totally agree. She read from the Trump script. Nothing special really @Valencia.. Where are you my dear??? @Phakamile Khuzwayo 100% the race thing is like all group guilt and division the oldest tool of scoundrels and tyrants designed to make us all weak and dependent. We unite and watch devils tremble. "@Heather Durr. Disappointed with Republicans "Its amazing how Zuma still has supporters just like Trump *perpetuate Slow mode is on because certain idiots do not like the truth. ENCA have removed me the skum bags. "@Heather Durr. Trump will be influential in the party 
2:23:14,2:26:51, @Aubrey wait a minute are you suggesting that there was voter fraud???. Whats happening with the stream @SABC @Rory Lee Farnham Yoh. Thats Bad. I also remember saying many months back that a Radio Station didnt allow you on air as well. Bad stuff bro. Censorship you think? @Aubrey. Lol..Im sure your joking @Kopz Koape Trump is awful but voers voted against Hillary and imho biden and Kamala are even more disgusting. haibo eNCA is broadcasting @SABC News What's happening with the live stream? @Aubrey..You still believe that even after the recount..Trump now is slowly accepting defeat..He never lead in any point of the election 
2:26:52,2:28:57, @SABC News the feed and the crackling sounds???? Please fix And then why is it flickering? @kopz koape those still supporting are the ones who were on the queue for tenders static 🤣 They started redefining the meaning and purpise of Exit polling in 2016 already because they eposed their election rigging fraud. Transmission problem at SABC are we still on a break guys Going to pop out the chat and go over to eNCA @Aubrey. So you believe this because Trump says so???.Political analyst and Some of Trumps own people admit that the election was sercure . 
2:29:07,2:32:04, me too ENCA is on eNCA is live @SABC News pic is on and off with patchy white noise Bring Cloudy back Cloudy or Clowny? @Pastor J.J "No @Anne M. Same one Rather change to eNCA. Perfect there but no chats. bye 
2:32:12,2:39:29, ANC recon it is clearly that there is nothing we can do here with African national corruption but to vote it out "Don't know about a phone USA is more captured by the Military industrial congressional complex to levels of sophistication Zuma could only dream of. It is not just a failed state but a rogue state and a dangerous one. @Kopz Koape I fully endorse his attemot to expose the fraud no matter his success or failure even while I strongly oppose his politics. It is a principle. We are ruled by law or the jungle. They needed 50 mil and were asking for contributions to help with the recon of their account A concealed donation via Mfundi.......No ANC NOOOOOO @Aubrey..Anyway Trump can always relocate to china when he officially retires from politics @Aubrey .The reason i say that is i think Trump loves China and he is so obsessed with China .He may retire and settle there 
2:39:38,2:44:27, what's happening @SalSA no one is beyond reproach perhaps we should all start there because if we don not acknowledge the inherent flaws of being human we end up here @Aubrey De Bliquy Read the article by the founder of 'The Intercept' re Biden Hunter and Burissma mhhhhhh Prime example of money laundering @SanFran Arnold "USA elections are a mass @Heather Durr Which founder of the intercept do you refer to? Glen Greenwald who recntly resigned when they censored him? go to enca @Aubrey De Bliquy Yes Glen - on that subject 
2:44:32,2:50:43, Nikki Haley is awesome. I have seen her before. another rare gem. My stream is working perfectly now OK I will try refresh @Aubrey..is that Nikki Haley the infamous christian stripper????..Or is that a different Nikki Haley you are talking about Nope still off At last i got the video feed back pictures but no sound Refresh and the feed is fine @Kopz Koape Im sure its not the stripper. LOL she is a governor 
2:56:33,3:03:16, "Yes Adv. Chaskalson I've been racking my brain to think who Adv Chaskalson sounds like and now I have it - Stephen Grootes . Don't you think they have similar voices? @SanFran Arnold The epic nature of these revelations belies the calmness of their delivery. @Anne M. you are correct. I do hear it @Anne M. Its a perfect match @Aubrey..Im kidding..Im a holy man.. @Thembisa. I agree but Prof Thuli has not been implicated by any witness at this inquiry. @Anne....Stephen from 405....I agree @Rob..Did you say Bushiri is holy. Lol . That's the funniest thing i heard all day 
3:03:24,3:05:41, I join in now. who's implicated by this witness so far? ANC directly "@Cooler Cat hi Also on Newzroom Afrika @Minnib Prince Can we just put a large fence around Luthuli House and turn it into a prison? 🙂 "@Cooler cat... ANC @Pastor. Yes they flock together ANC sending Joburg City contracts to EOH in return for donations. No services actually provided. @Tanki. You haven't really missed anything for a long period of time there was a Technical difficulty with SABC channel 
3:05:42,3:08:08, "Zizi Kodwa was named earlier today @Cooler Cat  @Tommy Kernaghan Consider it done. While we at it we can also do the same for Parliament. Lots of crooks there too @San Fran Arnold. Who's the Mayor of Joburg? "and the ANC asked for 50mil Are you going to give the catering contract to Bosasa @Pastor J.J 😉 or the A team? @Cooler Cat Geoff Makuba I am utterly gobsmacked at the sheer audacity of this We need to elect legislators and not parties who simply nominate legislators. @Anne M. A Team for sure. We will feed the buggers boiled cabbages everyday 
3:08:49,3:10:18, please don't forget about my fat cake hustle if there's any catering tender:elbowcough: Zizi Kodwa should payback the money he illegally gotten. 😂 @Pastor J.J Trips to NYC for Parks Tau and his wife. Can you imagine the ANC got money from Bosasa aswell. They are swimming in money! joh Heather....unbelievable. ..I am so done The witness is assisting the Evidence Leader. He is really bright😂 We will hire 2 Chefs to boil the cabbages. Nothing difficult. Lets check with our girls on the team who can boil cabbages "this is why Zuma and co are so upset 
3:11:05,3:13:23, And these are just the two we know of. I am sure there are more @Barbara Sattler @Pastor J.J I am sure that I can assist😉 "@Pastor. I can tender to boil the cabbage for the looters. My credentials Zizi Kodwa the spin doctor is also a corrupt element or what now? ANC reinstates Mpumalanga PEC member accused of raping his two daughters - quality leadership there! 🤬 @SanFran Arnold you are hired. Go to Food Lovers tomorrow and start practicising @Pastor J.J on it "@Cooler Cat... Very few ""clean"" people in politics" So guys the taxpayers are paying for the anc....am I right 
3:13:38,3:15:26, @Pastor. What about my tender? This award was rigged:goodvibes::goodvibes::goodvibes: In SA its a dog eat dog world All this money should be paying unemployed youth who are languishing doing nothing with poor COJ service 300 should have been on the call center you hold for hours no response ANC must be voted OUT nx "No Cocaine smuggling @Sal SA I am sure that it can be a JV @Lynn well basically yes "Via Denel and the other SOEs ANC should be voted out and ActionSA should be voted in 
3:15:27,3:17:51, @ Mr L. I always thought Zizi Kodwa is a clean spin doctor🤔 @San Fran. Consider it done You can't be spokesman if you can't spin a story @Kopz Koape Who is Action SA? @Sal SA 👌 @ Kopz I am with you "@Kopz Koape Sad The ANC has not stolen any cent from this company as they applied through the correspondences @Aubrey..Its herman Mashaba's new party 
3:18:04,3:19:58, @Coolcat ok now I'm really worried if you think Izzo kodwa is clean...the shortest list would be who's clean in their ANC you gonna struggle to get an A4 page Seems like everyone is tainted Who owns Mfundi? did these crooks not no that its going to come back to them "Well the ANC benefited not sure but Makhubo has ties to the company @ Cooler Cat @Kopz Koape Thank you. I will certainly find out abut Herman Mashaba's new party. Is he peddling racism like the rest of the losers? "No they didn't @Roza E When they weren't caught (or outed) the first time Mr Van Coller knew a lot more than he revealed. Whilst his testimony was necessary it was also very incomplete and convenient. 
3:20:23,3:23:29, @CoolerCat - looks like Zizi was the fixer - the glue that found the cabal together those people must be accountable for stealing i had enuf of these holier than thou crooks "@Aubrey.. No not at all .He has a plan that can benefit all South Africans smallernyana skeletons coming out The scheduling is well planned and orchestrated @Sal SA they stand in front of the public nd act like they did nothing wrong shame on them What time Tomorrow 10 @Roza E The ANC reminds me of cheating husbands
