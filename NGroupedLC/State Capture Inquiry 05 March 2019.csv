34:38,40:47, And the thiEEFs are in waiting for their turn to eat @John James This man is trying to avoid the question.

This man think his clever. Look at his eyes. "these insignificant witnesses are coming here to do one thing yeye phendula stosti. 
42:50,51:41, Something is wrong with the proforma invoice. @Mzalwane Mzala What find very unfunny is that the ANC voters have supported this looting of our fiscus for all the years and don't see anything wrong with it. They are all complicit And BTW I haven't always hated the ANC - it was only when it became blatantly obvious that they were in it for self-enrichment only that I started hating them.

1:59:55,2:07:25, following closely from Zambia lol @welton paulse I'm going to watch the eNCA broadcast. No problems there He can not recall. That is his answer. "When we asked this question about the medical campus at UKZN KUSAZONYIWA APHA "I don't think that Indians are any more prone to corruption than anyone else. As we have seen in the last few months @Felix Muyoba @Peter Staffen The man can not recall anything. @Desmond Masilela he was an accomplice in looting eskom as well 
2:08:09,2:14:30, "@Felix Muyoba Look now @Desmond Masilela i follow your argument "wow "Desmond Masilela he is also giving lots of other info  @Gcobisa ntsatha your point ? @Peter Staffen . I get your point. @John James remember that suppliers will promise him that if you effect the payments as soon as possible we will give you a tip..and then he does that without thinking of the consequences "Amatsheketshe ayantshontsha suka "This is why i'm getting confuse with this guy. if he can confuse the adv 
2:16:03,2:19:37, corruption knows no colour ! "no man absolutely let's get warrant search for his house we will get money hiding. why such a hurry to effect the payments without following the accounting procedures? what's wrong with Sabc today "very clever these guys @Franco Gresele agree he knew exactly what was happening 
2:19:39,2:23:02, If boss speaks it must be done quickly üòÉüòÉüòÄ "@makhosi nobhatyi no man The ears are even moving along with the hand gestures.. "these criminals should be tried in a Kasi Court @Franco Gresele hahaha please you are too radical on this what's this nonsense with ads! It looks like 99% of the people at the management of Eskom are white and Indian; all foreigners on our land. @Indoda Yamaqiniso true and this needs to be changed You transfer the money to someone now. They tell you it need 24hrs in order to reflect to the receiver. But this one just go direct with no delay. 
2:23:13,2:24:56, Anyone else also having issues with the feed reloading every time? Mine too. @Kurt Samson @Kurt Samson Yes!!

Together with the constant video reloads It's all talk with less documented evidence here "Yes Kurt "@Kurt Samson  
2:25:04,2:26:35, "It's Eskom @Kurt Samson Avast has an adblocker. Works like a bomb. @Felix Muyoba. Imagine sending such a lot of money and it reflect same time. üôÜüôÜüôÜ SABC Please . . . The feed and sound is captured. Can't somebody please notice it. Is there somebody competent who can actually attend to this ???? this guy would win an oscar "@Kurt Samson "@JS Bach I generally don't mind ads @Desmond Masilela imagine.. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

2:28:44,2:30:35, they just wanted their cuts from that 659 million Walton paulse that's racist Buffering again I'm sick of this If you don't rush you will not get yr double check plus bonus Another Naidoo @Felix Muyoba. Now the cuts from 659 let them in trouble. This is because of greedy of human being. @Desmond Masilela yebo another Khumalo Indra Reddy looools!! 
2:30:40,2:33:35, @Felix Muyoba. Now they must feel the heat. Nee man SABC!!! ü§£ @Desmond Masilela i wish the suppliers are also summoned to this commision "so all this happened in his absence @Felix Muyoba. I'm sure the chair will do so. Where are those whatsapp messages? @Desmond Masilela perhaps they (suppliers) may open up more cans of worm just like agrizzi Why is this guy staring at the roof? someone hiding in the roof with answers 
2:34:27,2:37:58, @welton paulse üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Maybe someone is giving him answers. More jails and even more money to keep them in jail. You must be special kind of stupid. do you know how much does it cost the state to run prison settlements? @Felix Muyoba. Lets hope so because this man is trying to hide the truth. "hau "@Indoda Yamaqiniso Besides executing them Haiiiboooo!!!! another 728m except 659m!!!! wow so much money Sending a person to prison for stealing money is a stupid thing to do as you will pump more money to maintain him/her. the 728 million includes the 659 million 
2:38:15,2:40:11, I bet that's why we chose not to send Apartheid criminals to prison. So you mean they must just leave them? with no arrest? Indoda what‚Äôs your alternative suggestion "I do not mean anything they will never be arrested? Strip.them their belongings this is all a waste of tax payers money @Desmond Masilela or he is saying Oh Gosh they gonna catch me out Then what is this commission for if no arrest will be done. 
2:40:34,2:42:46, "exactly He was going to be fired @welton paulse üòÇüòÇüòÇ The man is scared he think they might arrest him now. I m waiting for Nomvula Mokonyane to wear orange overalls This man is a liar Did you send an email or something? Hi Bridgette. Yes! and he should just leave the stand .... wasting my time with his BS He ask the question but he fail to ask why this rush rush of money transfer because that was benefiting him. 
2:42:46,2:44:01, Gupta brother ". "liar SABC please fix your bradcast @Sthakathi Khumalo I don't think its nice to make such comments ! lambaste this man not Indians on a whole . even his body language says it all he is a liar You can turn to eNCA "Sofia Sofia Typical Gupta associates then @Desmond Masilela that is why we need the suppliers to also come and tesity..perhaps they will tell us that we paid him to effect that payment 
2:44:09,2:47:36, Absolout the revelations are so shocking we are really in trouble. It feels like open season for liars at Eskom ! @Felix Muyoba. yes the suppliers must also come forward. We cant deal with this man alone when we see his telling liar. @Indoda Yamaqiniso Well what's the alternative - just let them get away with it? "SABC please fix your broadcast Zondo got him!! Eskom are like commercials?You can't believe a word they say ! Zondo is not fool 
2:47:49,2:49:47, Thought While the family rejoices that the killer of Reeva Steenkamp goes to prison and justice is being served; the reality says the killer is being rehabilitated with state money. He was indebt and needed money this one!! "No one can say that there was a lack of discipline at Eskom Just a typical example right there. I think if he spoke the truth he might have made sense ..... @Sofia Sofia very much true This is shabeer sheiks BROTHER Yes Indoda. So he is removed from society. And so should thieves 
2:49:51,2:51:54, Oh crap Koko at it again ...if you're smart he thinks not following orders is expensive?.. i guess he doesn't have the benefit of hindsight Did he resign from his position ? "@Michael Rijsmus I said it this morning I would rather do the right thing than do corrupt and things that will let myself in trouble one day. Or did he continue knowing what was happening ? He was following instructions he says!! @Sofia Sofia i think its more complicated than meets the eye 
2:51:54,2:55:50, He was going to be fired "Corruption is strife with white people His trying to build his version the Mafia that ruled ESKOM was very much strategic zONDO KNOWS HIS GUY IS A krook "Black diss one of their own together with whites and when it's a white person in the limelight he's like a snake trying to slither his way out of this. Zondo is no fool! @Indoda Yamaqiniso Sounds pretty racist to me "Problem with corruption of this magnitude 
2:55:58,2:58:55, "Felix Muyoba I aggre How is the truth racist? @Bridgette Kekana haha Bridgette Kekana haaaibo bazokuthelekela the leader of business at the time Cyril and Pravin and the rest knew exactly what was happening "@Indoda Yamaqiniso It's like me saying ""All blacks are criminals"" It's a generalisation and since not all blacks are criminals @SOFIA nonono @Sofia Sofia @welton paulse @Sthakathi Khumalo given the guptas saga..i am in support of @Bridgette Kekana "@Bridgette Kekana 
3:00:08,3:03:00, @Felix Muyoba . so you say that ALL and I mean ALL Indians are corrupt? @welton paulse no..not all but some even exploiters "Hence I didn't say ""all white"" people are corrupt. I said corruption is rife amongst white people and they protect each other no matter what "gents and ladies "Indoda "This thing of being loyal to other whites "You also didn't say ""some whites"" - you said ""whites"" which implies ALL whites - thus a generalisation" If you tell them today that Apartheid was the most corrupt system they'd deny it. 
3:03:21,3:06:42, @Franco Gresele Vernie Petersen proved that not all people have a price.Your statement is misleading and provocative "Who is ""they""?" @welton paulse but remember the fruit of a tree doesnt fall far away from the parent tree..it might be true "i agree Magda @Indoda Yamaqiniso It's quite clear that you're an out-and-out racist "Ahh... when you tell them the truth @ Welton Paulse you are right "@Felix Muyoba "all i can add 
3:06:45,3:08:21, cheers @Bridgette Kekana @Felix Muyoba No human race is superior; no religious faith is inferior. All collective judgments are wrong. Only racists make them ! @Indoda Yamaqiniso Show me one statement of mine that is racist. I can show you plenty of yours that prove you are a racist "Whites are naturally racists biggest mistake is we tend to generalize people to quickly and for no particular proven fact I rest my case Indoda Yamaqiniso - that it not true The most racist are always denying it. yes Ndoda 
3:08:21,3:12:29, yes Ndoda I'm not white but i can tell that not all white ppl are racist trust me. Agrizzi said he is a racist he did not denied it this guy was creating blank cheques for suppliers I think that as a nation we should stop navel gazing and demand that the ANC seek redemption and fire all the captured cadres...only then can we begin to heal Your father How juvenile. How old are you? Here we go again!!! Comments so easily gravitating towards race baiting and generalisations. See if we can all let 1 hour go by without falling into this pit latrine. its because of people like @Bridgette Kekana and friends our beautiful country is in shams !
