25:20,31:25, Many hours wasted in this manner I just have pic of the judge nothing else Took time off this is such a critical part of the commission I can see Ace lining up the judge / commission on serious fight bank mode Great now sound problems ! Couldn‚Äôt make this up . You would have thought that they could have become sufficient in doing this one task . No wonder ZA is in dire situation How come this Witness seems to have NO money ? What‚Äôs he done with all that stolen from the poor farmers ? ffs the sound! Bought a Merc I had the same thought. He must be innocent! Ffs Zondo makes some mind boggling decisions that makes one wonder about bias

Not on today? says it started streaming 32 minutes ago m.... the witness has no lawyer and wants to postpone again. I say that is his problem and the commission should just go ahead as this is costing taxpayers . ZA Judiciary very keen on their breaks to the extent that very little appears to get done on a daily basis . The same applies to this Commission
