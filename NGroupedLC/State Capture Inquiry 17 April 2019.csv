Definitely @welton paulse...Danny Jordaan and those bribes paid by SAFA is a huge elephant in the room @Michael Wild true..some elements raked millions from that event.. leave my girlfriend alone 
50:41,53:06, "The toll roads in Gauteng also needs an investigation "@Michael Wild if there's commission abt the 2010 WC and they build white elephant stadiums and could have just renovated the current stadiums. some places needed new stadiums because they did not have . but money was wasted or went into pockets The people were never consulted on toll roads @Aniceth De Missamou its now 2019 what has happened to that comission nothing @Innocent Madamalala sorry Ms September is spoken for hahaha lolest "@Magda Seguin The cell phone industry should also be investigated. They have captured all levels of govt. They write their own legislation. 
53:35,1:03:59, Where is Adv Maleka??? Judge Zonda is great "@welton paulse Its never easy @Derek Main people in the Cell phone industry who have info of wrong doing should approach the Commission I realised how the novices in the audience trying to ask questions as professionals struggle...it's a learning curve Ms September is doing well @Aniceth De Missamou Yes - I wish they would. They are a law unto themselves. I'm fairly sure corruption is involved. "@Magda Seguin @welton paulse He is not

But sadly many were crooked "@welton paulse Thant's all i got from mitchels plain  
1:09:39,1:12:36, @digitalemotionfilms. Show me one police ppl who where not bad at that time? @Musa Bakiti whats your native language? Desmond Masilela MAAANY . Anyone on here that knows what's going on with the Packham case? Burgers Park hotel owned by the ANC @welton paulse I am Zulu 100% Packham case live stream off-line now I was told that by someone at the hotel when we had a conference there. Its just incredible how many people are employed in south africa in government and nothing works 
1:12:48,1:14:35, @Magda Seguin the hotel in Pretoria? @digitalemotionfilms. I would like to tell you more about the police of that time but i dont want to. Because some of our fellow brothers died because of those police man. Under JZ everyone in a position of command believed they could do as pleased and get away with it since the head was rotten. "@Musa Bakiti  Yes...at one particular international confrrence @Magda Seguin yes it is. The one in Pretoria. @welton paulse awe my mase kent We were told beforehand that there will be heightened security only to find out that Selebi and Interpol also had a meeting there.

Hopefully she is out of this mess. üòû In order to protect their guests or their clients (comrades) 
1:24:50,1:27:25, Our government is just taking it to the next level "Why is this taking so long? Theres so much corruption @rohan barnard she left yes. Infact left Gauteng. @Musa Bakiti don't even get me started on churches. Those are the biggest bigots ever. Abusing religion to fill their own pockets and not even pay tax on that huge income. "@S Nompozolo hopefully she didn't leave you behind. I'm so sorry bro. üòû Stories like these @rohan barnard don't forget the abuse of females in churches "@rohan barnard  "Brixit is not a mess @Magda Seguin churches are just one big orgy. Look at all the sexual abuse claims against the ministers and popes 
1:27:34,1:31:22, All done under the banner of freedom of religion And none of those cases gets anywhere. Who is not corrupt today.I don't trust my wife and my kids although i still love them.what more my services from MTN can not trusted . MTN is way too expensive "@rohan barnard also because instead of investigating real crimes The Catholic church has been invaded by a group delivery to break it down from the inside...I have not yet read the complete documents but it is paedophiles that become priests lasting a century "News24 headline today : ""SA's decline worst of nations not at war Do you think the banks are not corrupt? @Magda Seguin my personal opinion is that 99% of the administration of the catholic church is sexual predators. 
1:31:31,1:34:09, @welton paulse exactly why do a minister need 8 bodyguards and including their deputies.And those blue lights!! Indians always have the best hair! @Derek Main News24 are all time with bad news stay away from them. The banks were at the Commission bt just to explain why they closed the Gupta's Bank Accounts. Phuza face The catholic church should be abandoned @Musa Bakiti Is any news that fingers the ANC bad news in your opinion? I am Catholic practicing 
1:34:38,1:36:23, ALL churches stem from the Catholic church @Magda Seguin I am sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. But there's a lot evil going on in the Vatican and churches world wide I am not upset...there is a lot I don't agree with "Shame @Magda Seguin I know that. But that's why most of them went their own way and doesn't associate themselves with the catholic church I'm herw Novice not amateur...there is a difference here* Thanks

All black people are not bantu @Norman Zwane Mitchell's plain pick and choose Why discussing woman on a platform where fraud and corruption should be discussed? more interessting this man is going to read the whole report @Gee J I'm also asking myself the very same question the details coming out now will lead to some more assassinations of police that took part and have details and will talk if not removed. 
2:00:57,2:02:21, "@Melvict Melbourne ""Ubuhle bendoda zinkomo zayo"" Fils is just a corrupted man here Thank you @Gee J this disrespectful behaviour pops up all the time giving all men a bad rap haha. Go find a girl and stop wasting time here @delphin yvon Moukouma Mboussi Only poor black people are bantus Norman....I hope you breed within your means. Why so many Indians implicated in state capture with Guptas I think bantu refers to a collective group of language spoken by black people in southern africa Men think about women 5 minutes in every hour for 55 minutes at a time 
2:03:13,2:04:49, @Melvict Melbourne and there isn't enough time in the day to think about them @Neville Watson that's not true and all started by your brother Gavin Watson "@Musa Bakiti I was in Mitchell's Plain 2 weeks ago @Neville Watson Crime & corruption happens where people have access. It's not about any particular group. So what must we do if she is the prettiest..!! She is still nonsons in leading!! @Anne M. Agreed. Doesn't matter if the transgressor are white black pink or purple. Put them in jail drink water Chair @Gee J the casis of your 'thinking' is ill informed. I am not poor but I am still a proud bantu 
2:04:53,2:06:13, The joke is that so far it was all linked to the cadres The chair is coughing heavy "DCJ is not well today @Norman Zwane That's not nice to say Oh no. Luckily I blocked Fils so I don't see that racist comments. the woman is making him short of breath Chair... stop now DCJ is struggling with his throat DCJ can I bring you a Strepsil? 
2:06:15,2:07:05, I've got some flu medication with me. Can someone come and get it for the chair please. Someone hand DCJ a lozenge in the meantime. He'll take his cough mixture during the lunch break. What about the Watson's? @Melvict Melbourne DCJ take a break @Gee J a meaningless word coined by Europeans. You have a better chance than me to understand where that gibberish originated from "Bantu people are the speakers of Bantu languages A block is coming up ..and he is coughing right in the mic It sounds like DCJ has a cold. 
2:07:07,2:08:51, Magda..the watsons were also cadres "Aaah man "we are going to need a new Chair @Sthakathi Khumalo üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ "@Melvict Melbourne that my friend is rubbish "And want about KPMG For cough @Norman Zwane HeartlessüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Benylin will help

2:10:28,2:12:02, @Norman Zwane But there are groups in South Africa that our proud of their Bantu heritage and refer to it as Bantu all the time. Hope im not offending anyone... he must see a specialist @Felix Muyoba Jesus wrote the dictionary @Thelsa üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ some guy in Zimbobwe "The chair is gonna be just fine "Marketing personnel from cough mixture companies They are all lost shame....

2:14:08,2:16:27, @Felix Muyoba My Jesus knows every word and its meaning @Naledzani Mashau üòÇü§£üòÇ I hear nothing about 2010 world cup staduim issue. Just Bravia tvs why uneducated and por? most of the people in this commission are coughing por? I think it is a case of over population. A cake can only be sliced into so many slices and the more the slices the smaller the protions. I watched a doco about Xolobeni last night. Any Issue that can bring up the name of the late Nelson Mandela must not come to this commission 
2:16:41,2:22:26, curious to know how much evidence leaders are paid per hour "@Melvict Melbourne You sound like a political baby "Norman And the seagull's name was Nelson @Melvict Melbourne As if you are proud to hsave been here for so long you cannot understand a basic language spoken all around you.

He pass on lucky for him Groot Griep or lead poison? Is South Africa ready for the election We are ready to bring EFF to power .Black Trump is coming @Melvict Melbourne Crooks who straighten up 'pass-on'. Its the crookedness that prevents the passing. Other folks somer vrek. 
2:33:45,2:38:00, They do the same thing again and again but expect a different outcome. @Musa Bakiti he will never be a black Trump - rather a Mugabe \ @Musa Bakiti Your prayer may be answered to our detriment. He is the son of the soil.He will bring true freedom @Norman Zwane I doubt it. @Musa Bakiti Freedom for his wallet... @Musa Bakiti Under the white man Trump the unemployment in the US 5 % - Mugabe's Zim employment is close to non-existing but every Zimbabwean has Trillions Zim dollars . Musa...if you think that you are number than what I thought you were. @Cameron Kim Why Mugabe not George Bush? Judging from the infantile conversation on this forum I deduct that some Says are not ready for democracy accountability yet. 
2:38:31,2:40:36, @Melvict Melbourne I don't get your point @Musa Bakiti Malema will make everyone in SA trillionaire just like Mugabe which company did the catering at that party *SOME SOUTH AFRICANS @Mikey Pie üòÇüòÇ Justice Zondo has the most soothing voice to listen to. It makes me feel so relaxed that I struggle to stay awake. He should narrate audio books. @Gee J Freedom for black wallets and black wine "@Musa Bakiti Mugabe destroyed his country  Malema is our leader whether you like it or not 
2:40:51,2:42:44, is this a festival of confessing and walking away or @Musa Bakiti SA will be laughing stock of the world. You must listen how the jokes about the idiot leaders today are all over the show . "say what you like about him  @Sanele Mabaso you are welcome to think he is great. @Cameron Kim let black people be what they want to be.Zimbabwe to me is just fine. @Sanele Mabaso why dont I like it? why is zondo interjecting so much. he never did it so much with other witnesses. maybe he's not happy with the evidence leader. "@Wandile Ranuga it seems so. I think that if a person is implicated "@Musa Bakiti great if Zim is fine for you 
2:42:49,2:44:15, The serious criminality of the ANC is flagrantly being addressed by someone who was smeared with lies is ignored for those who have the privilege to listen but they are wasting it with nonsense talk Zondo must keep interjecting "Please don‚Äôt fool yourself malema is not holy angel he is corrupt too @Musa Bakiti is the EFF a black party? Can you have a white leader? @BOBBY DCJ does that all the time to give perspective...it's his job @makhosi nobhatyi Dont forget to mention that he destroyed limpopo and inspires hatred and war @Magda. agreed!! @makhosi nobhatyi well said Malema for President 
2:44:52,2:46:13, @Cameron Kim Britain is fine but why plent british in USA? @Judith Louw great if malema is president for jokes "@Judith Louw go vote on 8 May sabc is captured "Agreed Louw """"""""Malema for President""""" 300000 Zimbabweans came into South Africa last year.

He helped form the CCMA u can say what u want its gonna happen definitely 
2:46:41,2:47:44, The literacy rate in SA is compounded by the high school dropout rate(StatsSA) millions compatriots don't have the luxury to grasp or understand this commission that is why the ANC will win Let the man ell the story @Sanele Mabaso Viva say it again so that the visitors can hang themselves tell "why economy become the centre issue here?? that is exactly failed CODESA talk  "@Judith Louw You think Malema will make SA great  Kim take saverall seats Zondo is starting to be confused u a fool u really arr
