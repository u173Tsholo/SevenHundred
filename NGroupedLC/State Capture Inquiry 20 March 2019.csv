"@Derek Main i hear you but one cannot go to a voting station with a view of voting for any party bar ANC All politicians are corrupted "@carnoth ngomane My take is that I'll study all the party's election manifestos before the election and then decide who serves my interests best. It won't be the ANC @ carnoth ngomane As long as it is not DA. Vote ANC for more darkness 
50:16,56:03, "@Derek Main MANIFESTOS can misleading steal okay but not the whole lot like anc I'm listening to this witness but i can not follow what he saying. I'm actually lost. "Structural plant equipment is old so calmed down ANC will respond to the crisis Did they only find out it is old yesterday? "If your choice is ANC The glass of water is finished already? there is a lot of info that this man has @Derek Main so to you everyone who doesnt see things your way is a fool? 
56:18,59:00, "The board executives comes there finds lot of irregularities and unlawful decisions was made by ex executives which lead us to this mass Ipsos found that South African voters' preference about political party presidential candidates :1. Ramaphosa is at 67.1% (6.71/10) 2. Maimane is at 37.2% (3.72/10) 3. Malema is at 34.6% (3.46/10) @myanc has finished this country. Our children and grand children will judge us harshly for voting for these thugs. It’s basically apartheid 2.0. @carnoth ngomane I think anyone who has witnessed how the ANC has destroyed SA and still votes for them is a fool. @kagiso william. Even the Jug is almost half and the guy is not even sited for more than an hour. Did Gordhan mention that they are awaiting diesel? How could he NOT have been AWARE of the TRUE situation? Rather concerning! @Moira T. Awaiting Diesel from where? Godhan dont know what his talking about. @Nosiphiwo Zantsi Evidence of fools He said he will get back to us in 10 to 14 days. 🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️ 
59:46,1:02:54, "More people will be arrested and prosecuted "@Derek Main seeing that you are smart may you please use your brain and advice me as to which party to vote for cos im stuck with ANC and that makes me a fool according to you "Ipsos predicts the ANC will get 61% of the vote "@carnoth ngomane Did you not read my reply further up? I'm not able to explain it any better - if it's not clear to you Nosiphiwo Zantsidue actually believe Ipsos as it ANC run "ANC 33% "So boring According to IPSOS the ANC dropped by about 1% from its 2014 electoral support. im out 
1:03:01,1:08:16, it was a time of the war (instability in southern africa) thats why denel had all profits.. "@Derek Main i guess it is a question of sending a child of five to fetch a child of five. your hatred for ANC makes look and sound like a fool According to IPSOS the DA dropped by about 3% from its 2014 electoral support. Who benefitted from this deal?? According to IPSOS the EFF gained by about 3% from its 2014 electoral support. "@carnoth ngomane You are right - I do hate the ANC. I didn't always but seeing what they have done to SA has changed my mind. If you vote for them regardless "EksDom is burning 100 MILLION RAND DAILY #Thando 👍🏻 @carnoth ngomane He always hated South Africa and thus he is spreading propaganda and insulting voters for exercising their choice. 
1:09:33,1:12:03, @Derek Main Zuma's tenure was disastrous indeed but now that Cyril is at the helm im gonna give ANC my vote irrespective of your view "“The DA may not achieve an outright victory in the Western Cape @Nosiphiwo Zantsi The ANC election lists are telling. A bigger bunch of criminals would be hard to group together. And that is what the fool ANC members want to let loose on SA. "@carnoth ngomane You can't fool me with this ""New Dawn"" nonsense. Still the same ANC - even Ramaphosa was there all along." @carnoth ngomane Where's the collective responsibility? #Derek Main. 👏🏻 PreZactly! "@Nosiphiwo Zantsi worry not i know his type "The poll suggests And to discuss on state capture nothing els. 
1:12:21,1:15:13, @Nosiphiwo Zantsi I'm no fan of the DA either. They're almost as bad as the ANC. @Derek Main then who can better run this country according to you? "Gwede Mantashe is the real head of state capture. Now he will make us suffer until we demand the nuclear plant @carnoth ngomane Clearly anybody would do a better job than the ANC - I'm happy to let my local stokvel have a go - they'd do a better job. "Ramaphosa is the most popular politician in the country by far "@Derek Main you cant keep telling us not to vote for ANC yet you cant provide an alternative Ramaphosa notches up a favourability ranking of 6.71 out of 10 "11 soccerdad And many more than Gwede. That “Gamat  Nosiphiwo Zantsi i am so please you believe this nonsences 
1:15:38,1:19:30, @Peter Staffen How is IPSOS owned by the ANC? @carnoth ngomane I'll try to explain this one more time (I know you're an ANC supporter). I will study all party's election manifestos once they release them and decide who serves my interests best. Nosiphiwo Zantsi i dont have to spell it out to you To say IPSOS is ANC is one of the craziest things I have ever heard. The EFF is the most succesfull party in terms of growth in this survey. the eef is the dumbest party only know to scream i did the testing on G5 and G6 artillaiary way back in 1979/80 @Derek Main you cant fool me sir? You are a DA and wmc staunch your hatred to people who like ANC says it all @Peter Staffen so what? those things were used to kill our freedom fighters "#Nosiphiwo EFF has gained supporters yes 
1:19:52,1:22:13, "@carnoth ngomane Sorry to burst your bubble - I'm not DA or EFF or ANC or any other party. I don't treat political parties like soccer teams. If hey mess up this inquiry is exactly the reason y the anc cant lead this country @carnoth ngomane You got him. He is not as independent as he portrays himself. According to this pol the EFF will replace DA as the official opposition in Gauteng. @Nosiphiwo Zantsi You can believe your own BS - you're an ANC supporter so I know you're challenged @Derek Main unfortunately for you sir ANC will win the election com 8th may with or without your hatred @carnoth ngomane Yes - they will - because we have so many fools in SA. I was never a Trump person - but WoW 😮 he sure is making USA great again! BiiiiG things happening there! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 @carnoth ngomane He probably wishes that his 1 vote counted more. 
1:22:48,1:25:50, "@Derek Main yest they messed up but if there people who wanna vote for so be it  "Inquiry helps the country to know what went wrong @carnoth ngomane Yes - it is their right - it doesn't make it any less stupid. #Derek Main - can’t reason with the unreasonable 🤦🏼‍♀️ The comments make it perfectly clear. Blood Seekers. "The Minister of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation Felix Muyoba now you have convinced me that you a idiot if you read my statement i did the original testing on the guns i did kill anybody it was in developement stage. "@Derek Main unfortunately for you @Nosiphiwo Zantsi Now that is telling too. The very person that would have continued Zuma's state capture is popular among the ANC members. How stupid can you be? "Zuma lied to South Africa and the ANC 
1:25:54,1:28:53, "@Peter Staffen The most conservative polster @carnoth ngomane Yes it is painful. I fell SA could soar if only we could get rid of the ANC. @makhosi nobhatyi What happened to collective responsibility? To try to blame it all on Zuma is disingenuous - the entire ANC is corrupt. "@Derek Main clearly you cant get rid of Anc "You must understand that Zuma did what he did on his behalf not for ANC Nosiphiwo Zantsi i am fully aware of this but not by that margin Have you dumped Trotsky @African Refugee ? @carnoth ngomane To many idiots around. @Derek Main and you are one of them 
1:29:15,1:31:37, "“Ramaphosa is carrying the election for the ANC. He has built its credibility @carnoth ngomane haha "@makhosi nobhatyi As we have seen from these commissions @carnoth ngomane No - I don't vote ANC anymore - I've seen the light. #African Refugee 👍🏻 On Point. "@Derek main that was a strategy to come things down if you see how loud those who were close to Zuma @Derek Main you have never voted for ANC and you never will @carnoth ngomane And you know this how? I'll never vote for them again. Rama is as BAD! A liar through & through! Only his eloquence & tupperware toothed smile ... fooled SOME. 👹 
1:32:29,1:38:29, "@makhosi nobhatyi stop explaining yourelf "@Derek main yes he was not alone @makhosi nobhatyi OK - so you're now admitting it's not only Zuma. I put it to you that it stretches right down to municipalities - there is corruption at all levels of govt - thanks to the ANC. "Carnoth ngomane not that ANC couldn’t see what Zuma did problem is he like to play victim @African Refugee Yep - the rot runs deep in the ANC. 🎯 #African Refugee - Exactly! And as we know ... maggots only feed on rotting flesh. Makes sense. @African Refugee She was probably too honest to belong to the ANC. "Derek main as head of the nation should fight corruption not you as president get involved how do you expect that happen? Security agencies 
1:39:16,1:45:20, @makhosi nobhatyi Yes they were - and they are all still there - including Ramaphosa They can’t have somebody who would stifle their ‘93 organized plan. "African refugee look things you may do during your time as someone in control but results will come after you @makhosi nobhatyi You can't fob off all the country's ills on Zuma. Many other players were (and still are) involved in corruption. "#makhosi . Yip "Derek main Zuma is number one Some people played a big role for destroying our country.without pointing fingers we know them they know them selfs UDF was ANC inside South Africa @makhosi nobhatyi I'm not disagreeing that Zuma was an out-and-out criminal but I'm saying there are many more like him n the ANC. 
1:46:00,1:48:42, A majority of the UDF leadership were underground ANC members "@Nosiphiwo Zantsi Let's be honest - we should be talking about the ""Old ANC"" and the ""New ANC"" - two totally different organisations." "Report comes out about security agencies how they operate to protect Zuma by spreading lies I was there Ramaphosa was in the UDF ramaphosa his iscorrupt like zuma leaders what's is UDF somebody must help me here Am lost so when are we going to arrest some people hmmm? United Democratic Front 
1:48:42,1:51:24, oh wait the bad guys always win Paul Mashatile was a deputy secretary of a UDF regional structure "Derek main thanks we are together that is why we have this commission to see what went wrong and those who did wrong face consequences that is all we are doing @Nosiphiwo Zantsi imayelana nani uxole ngemibuzo eminingi. Am I in the wrong chat group here? I roughly scrolled back to read some comments on what Riaz Sallojee was saying but nothing happening here. The UDF was an umbrella/ front that had many organisations and led the popular resistance inside the country in the 80s. Problem being - All Of this was left to the 11th Hour! Why? "@makhosi nobhatyi The problem is the longer the commissions go on 
1:51:30,1:53:46, Are there people here that wants to resuscitate a dead horse like the UDF? ok thanks cc I have a understanding now "Those who says Ramaphosa is corrupt please come forward with evidence @makhosi nobhatyi He took money from Basasa. Explain Marikana! #makhosi nobhatyi 😉 Bosasa IF you throw a bucket of dirty water into the ocean does it or would it make the ocean dirty? @makhosi nobhatyi They have no evidence but Derek will keep on lying. @makhosi nobhatyi He voted in parliament to protect Zuma. 
1:54:23,1:57:37, @Nosiphiwo Zantsi He has admitted that himself - have you got your head in the sand? This idiot does not now the definition of corruptio "Derek main Anc is not corrupt so certainly individuals within the Anc who corrupt "He does not know the definition of corruption Anything that @Derek Main does not like is corruption @Talent P Sibisi I'm no fan of the DA and didn't vote for them. But you have to be a special kind of stupid to to see how the ANC has wrecked SA and then still vote for them. @Nosiphiwo Zantsi Why don't you explain what corruption is then? "Is it true that ""Behind every great fortune lies a great crime""?" @Nosipho Zantsi I really don’t understand really why would you hate Ramaphosa? Zuma choose his people boys who will defend in parliament don’t you notice in his cabinet and top 6 
1:57:47,2:00:17, "@Derek Main CR17 campaign fundraisers admitted to accepted money from Gavin @makhosi nobhatyi There might be a few individuals in the ANC who are NOT corrupt. I feel sorry for them - it must be hard seeing what the ANC has become. Viva Anc viva #Nosiphiwo. I call BS! Squirrel knew! @Nosiphiwo Zantsi So you want to try to draw some distinction between Gavin and Bosasa - semantics. You can fool yourself but not everyone else. Voting on a party mandate in PR based system is not corruption. Go back to school @Derek Main ✊✊✊Ramaphosa viva ANC never do nothing to anybody or u mean members of ANC who corrupt correct your statement Bro @Derek Main @Talent P Sibisi He is doing it deliberately 
2:01:49,2:07:23, We will defend ANC not individuals those whom did wrong must face consequences of their action that is what the ANC says White People the think they clever than cause they talk English calm on man that's your home language we don't care about that's mnxn “Never Did Nothing” 🤣👏🏻 Translates to? 🤣😂🤣 "#Talent - you got that right! 👏🏻 Our “Home” language! SA is our home Condolences to the chief whip of the ANC on the death of his daughter @Mzalwane Mzala Sad to lose a child May her soul rest in peace May her soul Rest In Peace "@talent. What if there is a trend that the people ANC deploys into government go there and do corruption 
2:08:13,2:11:03, May her soul R.I.P. We may differ in politic but when time like this strive we all unite and comfort one another. If a child loses its parents they call him / her an orphan. There is no word like that if parents loose their children .... to sad for words. @Thulani Bukani How many of the 249 ANC MPs are accused of corruption? #Thulani 🎯👍🏻 CR is planning to reduce his cabinet after the elections @Frik Brits True Turbulent unity is busy investigating all money went out of our country those who bank money overseas hard luck for them we will bring it here back to government "I accuse them all of corruption. When we were sold the “fire pool” and all through Nkandla none stood up and said no. So for me #makhosi We wouldn’t have been in this added mess 😢 
2:11:12,2:13:48, @Nosiphiwo Zantsi Huh?!? You are putting words in my mouth - where did I say anything about PR system and corruption? @Bridgette Kekana yes he is going to reduce it it is too much #Thulani. You’re a sensible man 😌👍🏻 "@Talent P Sibisi As the evidence shows the whole of JZ cabinet is corrupt to the core 👍🏻 @makhosi nobhatyi What happened to collective responsibility? "@Derek Main  Moira T we are in this mess bcoz people were not truthful to our party and SA so they must answer why did they sell our revolution? 
2:14:03,2:19:33, "@Talent P Sibisi When ANC can't argue on the merits they even said JZ is not going to pay back even a cent CR must start to fire Nomvula Bathabile "@Derek Main  @Frik Brits The ANC uses the collective responsibility when it suits them. "Derek main it Zuma who force executive to says that if you remember ANC try to criticize him back 2014 and 2016 "@Derek Main  @makhosi nobhatyi And yet the ANC voted to protect Zuma time and again in parliament. The rich dont go to jail "@makhosi nobhatyi In fact 
2:19:41,2:21:50, Rich will go to jail I said it once more again And EVERYONE is going to vote ANC in May ??? Let me listen to this evidence guys I will vote for the anc "@Makhosi the party told us it made mistakes and it took collective responsibility. So if the mistakes are corruption based @Marcus Levack Why? @makhosi oooohhhh. You want to listen to the evidence now. Oh ok fethu. @Brits ppl dont want change Anc has already won the polls Ask him @Derek Main ?? 
2:22:28,2:25:53, "@Bridgette Kekana Polls means nothing because I think Ramaposa is dealing with corruption and the perpetrators will go to jaik jail "@Bridgette Kekana  The wrongdoers hate CR "#Marcus @Marcus Levack Where was Ramaphosa when Zuma was causing all the destruction? - right there next to him. Don't hold your breath. "Thulani Bukani collective responsibility does not mean that we are leaving you go away with wrong I cant wait to c them in orange overralls from their expensive suits 
2:26:04,2:29:58, "@makhosi nobhatyi When the ANC says they're strong on corruption #Derek Main - Correct! Well versed & decades of experience. "Jackson Mthembu call Zuma to parliament when he defied ANC to step down So we as South Africans must wait for ANC to deal with its factions while it plummets state resources? You clearly agreed with Zuma when he said ANC comes before South Africa. #Thulani - you’re a refreshing change 👊🏻 The only possible reason you could vote for the ANC is because you think you'll benefit from the corruption. We know it's not for service delivery. Hurry ... please sir ... I have to work 😬 0.2% pecent of ANC members is corruption now we are going to serious stuff 
2:30:16,2:34:23, Yes I was awaiting for this moment "Derek main that is not true brother whom must we really trust @makhosi nobhatyi The point is that a party that was less corrupt could have done 100 times better than the ANC. no one can proof that one member of the ANC is honest can this guy just go to the points not to wara wara..? All meeting took place at Saxonworld Even business meeting "We are continue fighting for our people 
2:34:48,2:36:48, Lots lies between the “Wara Wara” #Felix Muyoba @Moira T yes 😱😱😱😱 Malusi Gigaba was there as well GIGABA these are my friends.. Guys stop with all this parties and. Listen to this news of Guptas Malusi Gigabytes is going down @makhosi nobhatyi Now that is part of the problem - what the ANC says and what it actually does are worlds apart. They will say anything to continue their plundering. Gigaba is rotten to the core AND Squirrel is PROTECTING HIM ... Lekker to earn biiiig bucks but do stuff all to earn it - 👹 
2:37:10,2:42:10, that guy (gigaba) is hopeless "Psyfrequent Techno you talk like opposition parties they put their thought with your mouth Gigaba again South Africa will be a better place if President Ramaphosa and his ANC deal with the members that keep on popping up each time there is a smell of corruption. this is now the real test for this guy not those wara wara stories about how he ran denel.. #Malusi - Squirrel would need to include himself. Gigaba will not be in cabinet again "Hmmm ... yet nobody came forward agreed 
2:42:26,2:48:36, then it means this guy was brought at denel by the guptas.. Gonna need to ask J&J for tons of Vaseline 😉 "@ Moria. In African tradition Get Gigabyte before he disappears with his FAKE PASSPORTS & PERMANENT RESIDENCE in GuptaLand!!! An important meeting that last for 7min 😱 If you work together in the future said Gigabytes 😃😃😀 "Rama is protecting Gigabyte! Give them a means of “Protection” in Jail Gigaba was captured very easy. He Actually sold this country and he denied all this allegations against in parliament. He doesnt deserve to serve the nation.. 
2:48:50,2:51:14, SOLD OUR COUNTRY TREASON No ways Ramaphosa does not protect anyone Gigaba is in the same team as Ace Magashule so the list combined by secretariat so president has nothing to do with the list these guys were and are still using ANC as a passport to wealth accumulation through thievery #makhosi Squirrel is complicit ... klaar! @Felix Muyoba Exactly! and yet Gigaba still appears on the infamous parliamentary list of the ANC... #Felix 👊🏻👍🏻 @funicanz All the people on that list are corrupt - it's just the degree of corruption that differs. 
2:51:32,2:55:30, 👍🏻 true @Derek Main Super Six so in the thick of it too! NEC too must be dissolved. “TOO”! Why did you not come forward ... then already??? now i sense lies in this guy @Moira T exactly He was also eating. You can't with food in your mouth. Simple.. Here come BS Excuse but if he directs you you can decline because he is not your employer

3:00:30,3:03:45, Zuma son was in the meeting So was Ace Magashule son was there Off topic: Apologies in advance 😇 Vince Smith was a MAJOR disappointment. Is Salim Essa in the country or did he also move to Dubai? Anyone know? @Moira T. This witness says he applied for the position the position was advertised an he apply for it. So im saying I did not see that post. Where was it advertised? This oke is clutching at straws now. #Desmond Masilela. Fanx 👍🏻 Ace Magashule son was working for Guptas that is why they took R200 million of stina diary he must account I always insist that 🎯 
3:04:29,3:09:10, @Pheladi Lamola I also want to know - but I'll be very surprised if he's still in the country Salim Essa need to come and account @Talent P Sibisi. Up until now the guy was not held accountable. His now in the ANC name list. We must all support President Ramaphosa to arrestees all of this people @Moira T. You welcome "@psyfrequency Techno theres nothing wrong with ANC sometimes ANC is playing with us all Mr Ramaphosa must help.

3:09:34,3:12:28, Talent P Sibisi he is the only one who can do that if he failed as number ANC will die. Zuma wanted to leave Anc in hands of Dlamini Zuma knowing that he will be safe but he lost and he was shocked change the electoral system. "Put Bars around parliament @psyfrequency Techno is there still communism in this world? Techno stop being stupid T can understand people want to stick to their political party of preferance. What I do not understand is how they complain but turn a blind eye to corruption and when spoken about you get lambasted #Makhosi Spot On! #Francel 🎯 ...and Riaz Saloojee will still vote for the rotten ANC...a very bad habit too many South African voters seem to be unable to break. 
3:13:23,3:18:05, what does it say of the majority of us the voters? Somehow I miss Thabo Mbeki "The rats are in hiding "They need the aliens Not comfortable 🤦🏼‍♀️ ooops.
