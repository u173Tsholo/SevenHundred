I will study all party's election manifestos once they release them and decide who serves my interests best. Nosiphiwo Zantsi i dont have to spell it out to you To say IPSOS is ANC is one of the craziest things I have ever heard.

1:46:00,1:48:42, A majority of the UDF leadership were underground ANC members "@Nosiphiwo Zantsi Let's be honest - we should be talking about the ""Old ANC"" and the ""New ANC"" - two totally different organisations."
