time,17:12,message Thank you Chair. The Evidence Leader must always give background we dealing with many cases here. was already busy googling who is Mrs Dube. agree 😂😂 Already Googling 🤣@Asanda we indeed dealing with many cases 😂😂😂 Ay! Ayanda. I agree with you though "LOVE LOVE LOVE THE FACT THAT THE WORLD IS WATCHING "Yes Agrizzi Evidence leader did a opening statement. Chair decided to show him how it's done. 
18:14,22:32, This evidence leader and that white old lady are not the best in the business bayantantazela I'm surprised the chairman so calm when he was told two persons are excused for today. Usely he's serious and talk about the little time that's left for the work of the commission. "@Akhona greetings all who is testifying today? "@Max I'm not sure where is he Passive aggressive witness "@Maxwell Sibiya yes Witness full of attitude 
22:34,24:37, @Maxwell Adv Malake has gone back to private practice to make more money from this thieves:yougotthis: She initially worked in the kitchen!! it's not a long list 😂😂 so? @Quinton We dealing with Bosasa today. about 3 witnesses expected. 2 already skipped us today There's a head on collision between the Evidence Leader and The Chair Definitely Sifiso! They both seem to want to lead the evidence "lol we going to have a long Day @Garth if that's the case. the commission missed out on a great Adv. 
25:04,31:03, I wish NPA could utilize Ad Hoffmeyer to be their one of prosecutors to prosecute the state capture criminals. Vanita I think it's a competence issue. I feel the chair doesn't have faith in the evidence leader Letter of appointment? "The questions might be the same "shame Ms Dube looks scared Yes Sifiso thats why the chair was providing guidance "Once the chair start asking questions himself like this "@Akhona Gala true 🤣🤣 
31:19,38:35, Anxiety in the house having this on helps me sleep "Nomvula likes 🍖 🥓 meat that is why she's so ""Mama-Action"" nogals stolen meat" @Akhona Gala @Esme Van Heerden lol we not sure how u guys want the Chair to do that. i hope its clean and no pun intended "this commission is not organized the swinging chair is a problem.... She is too comfortable lol @Motlalebona i agree with you I think this witness was supposed to have evidence on her home language then have interpreter.. I think things was gonna flow "Its the nerves 
39:03,40:17, interpreter PLEASE!!! sit still... stop swinging lol. i said it 🤣🤣🤣 Evidence Leader is annoyed by the movements lol HAHAHAHA we r also annoyed by his line of questioning loo evidence leader lowo no flow or whatsoever she dont have that type of chairsa ate her house can't identify heads of the discussion 😂Asanda uyandigqiba😂 They also did Birthday for Jacob Zuma🙈😅😂🤷 
40:23,42:06, @Ridwaan Ismail lol that is an assumption u making there "Miss Dube she must behave its seems like she forgot where she is Mama Action must come back to explain this special delivery "anxiety is dealing with her i feel like holding that chair so that she sits stills 😂tjo tjooo Ms Dube is telling everything as is lol the Chair is swinging again as soon as she mentioned Uncle GWEDE Fikile Mbalula and Gwede Mantashe were frequenting Bosasa Office 😅😂🤷 I feel you Mark - about the chair 
42:19,43:22, The witness needs both a still chair and and interpreter... "Swinging in the chair like a child she is very poor too much dithering @Angel 😂😂😂 plastic chair will do lol finally @Sidney P lol Guys get this lady an interpreter. this isnt working bloody go 
43:26,44:59, why is this witness here? waste of time Thanks Ms Dube that was very entertaining and annoying at the same time finally!! Sit STILL lol @ Akhona. I am so disturbed. I could not follow. Too much swinging and lack of vocabulary to express herself. she is going to buy that chair at her house lol @ Sidney. I 2nd the plastic chair!!!! lol 
45:10,48:26, "I feel for her sometimes you ppl are annoying... this lady will help connecting dots since Nomvula denied everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! jacob zuma!! lol yangena iStellembosch Madoda @Asanda yangena iWhite Collar Crime 😆 @ Asanda looool @Akhona Gala Whats enough? She was asked if she needs interpreter and she said she is proficient in English. Yiu cant blame others for her incompetency. Chair dont like this evidence leader. Justin i also don't like this evidence leader he's look warm 
49:15,54:30, "@Sidney 😂😂 enough there's a new witness on stage now @Melor Hadebe I agree with you. The chats on here focus on irrelevant observations instead of the evidence given. And she gives away very important facts implicating the big fish. @Akhona Gala Very codescending of you. Now yiu dont like the evidence leader but sympathetic with witnesses At some point it came across as though Ms Dube could and wanted to say more but either the nerves or the language stood in her way. Anyways ke sizwe the new witness. The evidence leader has never been this happy 😃😃 from 80 to 120 to 270🤭🙈 Anyway there no arrest and they will never b When you commit crime oneday things will come out in the open for everyone to see your shinanigans... None. 
54:37,59:12, This is so useless we are lead by liars 🙈 ok sorry Sidney i withdraw continue to attack Ms Dube. It was very brave of her to come to the commission and i think she did much better than Zuma interms of answering Q's lol am not saying anything but yeeeeeeey Evidence Leader buvuliwe mkhuluwa wam. So what if Bosasa paid for a birthday party?... someone help! PPE thugs will be in correctional service baboshwa nini abant @Singi Mathebula If that happens I'll pay for your drink... he is saying he took back leftover liquor:elbowcough:who does that. his such a liar 
59:35,1:06:15, any photos Kufikiselana ngenhloni thinking our leaders are/ were / have been out there partying at the expense of the tax payers. We had been taxed so they can party. Events organizers do that XD @Angel Mtshali Not tax but Bosasa bribery "Thank you payment @Akhona Gala HAHAHAHAHA No No No your Comment is not Commissionery Total function costs!!!!!!!!! "@ KD Sibisi Soon hopefully - CR surprised us with his open letter on corruption 
1:06:30,1:10:18, lets hope he acts on his statement let's see He can't do anything @Kevin Nit when Ace is SG @Martha Motuba: Those orange overalls are for mere mortals like us. sadly. "who is this man (with own hairstyle) just came now With all this evidence why is Mokhanyane not being handcuffed and taken to a police holding cell as she lied under oath?? loooool😂😂😂😂 Mortals like us ??? @Angel Mtshali Don't forget y'all that this gossip has already cost taxpayers R1 billion. Mara this Ms Dube was a poor witness hle...she doesn’t really follow. She often jumps before the gun 😨 
1:10:23,1:13:41, @Derek Govender : Arrests don't happen for those people. It's court cases and appeals!!! @Angel the question is WHY SO??? Tea break Aii Today's witnesses are boring @Angel Mtshali unfortunately that is true Was bout to say!!! I need a break too @ Sidney P "All these ZuGupta Nexus are habitually pathological Liars. Zuma refuted everything He is finished too Aiii Waste of resources Mr Lana haircut should have some photos too of the guests. or we can hunt Facebook for her friends. Lama. 
1:14:32,1:19:14, Surely there must be photographs taken at that function Ms Dube could have done this too but the chair and language!!!! Bosasa paid for Nomvula's birthday party. I wonder how she will argue this one @sidney P she already appeared before Zondo but lied through her teeth like all ANC members from Cyril down Cross examination of Mokonyane will be very interesting @Derek Govender she must appear to clarify this revelations "@Angel Mtshali and Derek Govender Mokonyane said they will pick up a rand when our economy was downgraded hopefully there will be few of those who attended the party who will be coming to collaborate this testimony otherwise it is just a waste of time. or cross examination will give much more insight @Sidney P but if you or myself lied we would have been behind BARS by now right!!! 
1:23:15,1:43:45, A cross examination is much needed here. Mrs Thomas don't Wana come to the commission guys dnt forget we having a Cross examination with the Enterprise Minister the one wa Rogue unit So far this is a joke! Is there no Contempt of Court applicable here? THEY R ENJOYING THIS AS LONG AS IT DRAGGS ON THEY ARE GETTING PAID can something please happen to wittnessess qho doesn't took the commission sreious Zzzz... "we reject the excuse from this witness  Hear hear!
