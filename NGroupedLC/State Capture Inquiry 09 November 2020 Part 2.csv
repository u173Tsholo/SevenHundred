-16:26,-12:02, Are you in law Heather? Cat find a reference though on Twitter. Yes I am a qualified lawyer looking for a job as I am too old and dont meet the BEE standards *cant Ok I saw the interview last night. Its on youtube they only laid a charge. Is that charge enough for an arrest? Its always amazing to ask a legal person stuff cos I feel sometimes we go by emotion and not what the law provides I have returned to melt the heart of the coldest witch its mo hard 2 love than it is 2 hate That is the same as an arrest as they need to go thru the courts with her as an accused etc You had me rading twitter and all media houses looking for that arrest🤣🤣 I feel it is needed though. for the sake of whistle blowers 
-11:24,-6:18, But she wasnt apprehended into custody or in a jail/holding cell Ok I hear what you saying Heather she will have to go to court and answer like a criminal for the crime.

So disappointing Slay him slay him 
1:37:19,1:38:16, "So this is during his time. So what now?? Was he still ""not there"" @Bheki." @Jabu Malinga Agreed. Let's give Aggrizzi his due. Not that it excuses him completely as the corruption shadow will remain over him. jz mafia I don't follow min stream news because they mostly lie or have no clue what is happening. I follow SABC to get an idea of the prevailing public narrative. 😫 this is real people Cancel the order and place the order on China @BandiZa Watson is still alive !!! People must tell us whats going on @Ann M the problem is that no report can compel anyone to have integrity...these people are just vrot..no one can change that 
1:38:20,1:39:30, Agrizzi never bribed any1.. he was the Uber eats delivery boy for the corrupt This is the reason why all SOEs they bankrupt now laat ons hoop dat hulle mekaar in die hof aanskake Agrizzi should be thanked for telling the truth lets hope they all turn on each other in court @Rene ending corruption is a first step so this commission is waht seperates ud from tryranny of demagogues and political parasites. @Jabu definitely but he tried to run so he was thanked with bail at least So it is going to take them 11 years to develop a prototype?. The product is out of market. "@Jabu Malinga In which case 
1:39:40,1:40:23, a fine maybe for delivering the cash and a big thank you for telling the country what really went on at Watson HQ still not innocent skat *my skat "@thembisa odendaal Agree No comment i remember Airbus A380 program slept just few months. the program manager was fired. @Blake Yogi I’m disappointed dental records were not verified and the media didn’t follow up. I’m not suggesting any conspiracy merely lamenting the lack of media follow up and the strange... "Zondo let Myeni off the hook "Rene 
1:40:32,1:41:16, ...circumstances of Watsons death being largely absent from public consciousness @rene that will be very interesting we remember Bandit @heather are you a lawyer? something rotten That's the million dollar question @Rene Ngwenya . What now? How do we recover from this? DCJ my love-deal with it. It is what it is @BanditZA Not everyone's. Echoes of Brett Kebble R7.6 bn and the prototype is incomplete

1:42:06,1:42:58, @Bandit maybe they followed up and found nothing cos media loves sensationalism like that. They would love such stories. it needs evidence otherwise it remains a conspiracy theory like aliens in USA Is this witness storing the cash in his cheeskop "GIGABA I wish I could talk so casual about these monies 💔 "Give the purchase order to China 🤯🤯🤯 "It seems the undermining of Armscor may have been wilful at some level. @Thapelo FIRE COMRADE FIRE!!!!! this watson case reminds me of gert van rooyen and joey haarhoff and those little girls are still missing

She named him on purpose to let her co conspirators know who he is. *whew ... thought i was in trouble for a sec @Wilde. this is an inquiry. Information. Not a court of law. Only the NPA can do that.
