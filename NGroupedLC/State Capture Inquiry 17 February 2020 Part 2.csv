13:56,17:18, Did not state how long adjournment to be. Could be another hour. They sorting the legality out for Mr X taking of the oath. "Hope all these hearings bear fruit ans the assets returned to the treasury. Eskom must get their short-fall from treasury DCJ is making very sure that all the t's are crossed and the i's dotted. Nobody wants anything from the commission to be thrown out of court. Checkers don't run to the public for bail-outs. @Deric Main...mention Dudu Mnyeni and Zumba comes to mind...and vice versa "@Mbuso "@Anne M. You are defending Zondo mbuso don't show your igmorance 
17:31,18:53, "Mbuso Zondo ate too much during lunch now he feels sleepy😀😁😂😂😁😀 I have an enormous amount of respect for Judge Zondo. 👍🏾 me too Anne "Same here So do i. @Mbuso Ndlovu I am happy to defend Judge Zondo. And for Kate. True. 
18:56,21:45, "11 Senior ANC officials on hit list for fraud and corruption .... including Magashule @Margareth Waterboer Yes - there were rumours that they were/are lovers. Doesn't bring a pretty picture to mind. "anne me too @Anne M. Wait until you appear before him because of corruption charges or state capture "@Norma Day Yes Zondo is better than Mogoeng Mogoeng "Same applies to you @Mbuso Ndlovu I won't be appearing before him because of any charges. I respect the Commissions work but they need to work on time management. 
22:03,24:13, @Derek Main.. 😂😂😂👍🏼 If i were guilty of corruption charges it would be my not judge Zondos. 👍 time management. Are we restricted from the hearing now? "No mr x come out pls man Thanks. More then half an hour wasted. @Gareth Hellyar True 
25:39,27:55, now the hairstyle???? masters in time wasting. they will ask for an extension again Mr X is Zulu😁😁 they were never ready for the x guy rolling blackouts while hairdresser halfway "The Chickens will be coming home to roost @person. We’ll said What a Hairstyle!!!!!!!!!!!!!😀😁😂😁😀 They are going to recognize the voice and know who is talking. 
28:19,30:40, @Zibuyile Luthuli I was thinking the same 😲 Of coarse!! @Zibuyile Luthuli He is known Yes Mr X!!💪💪 They have verified death threats against Mr X and uzumthumela ngezinkabi esa sikhohlakalikazi the karate kid with that hairstyle especially done for TV Shame everyone wants to kill The problem is that people secrifice and risk their all to reveal corruption but NPA and the HAWKS play no role to assist or arrest just one excuse after the other 
31:27,34:20, @Elvis Malakoane Yes - that is the bottleneck at the moment. And the criminals keep on plundering in the meanwhile. Elvis you hit the nail on the head there. Judge never misses an opportunity to teach🤣🤣 Miss Interpreter Zondo is delaying the proceedings again and again😎😎😎😎😎😎 "Elvis Where is mr X Behind the glass. "Mbuso 
34:22,37:19, @Mbuso Ndlovu You seem to have a real beef with the chair and the commission - care to explain? stalingrad tactics Zondo @House MusiQ ZA Hiding somewhere in Dubai😀😁😂 very bad and painful 😂😂😂 Thats bad... So we know his company and we know he is the owner. There goes the anonymity... @Derek Main We are entitled to our opinions anonymity is out the window now. hi 
37:45,42:07, @Colleen Arezio True He is scared to show his face to the public and media. The fact that company known he should have come forward. me think I'm in class solving for x true anonymity just ceased 2 exist Zuma and Dudu bagqilaza abantu bakithi to fulfill isidingo zabo baphuca isinkwa sabamnyama chaa ayankelekile tuu le @FieliesSA I’m always nervous with anonymity and a slip that might occur... @Mbuso Ndlovu Of course we are - just trying to understand where you're coming from. Would you be critical no matter what? Mam Dudu know him right now. 
42:16,45:27, the culprit for the disclosure of the cc is the Commission itself. Oversight or Incompetence. I leave it to you Dudu knew he was coming here today. Called his daughter last night. "@Person of Interest...she worked on this witness over the weekend too.. They work very hard behind the scenes...long hours... We only see them during these sessions "Masinga xhashazwa ngabo badla izambane lika pondo pretending as abantu abamele izidingo zabantu Ai! This madam! biiiiite de noir Miss Hofmeyer was almost in tears when she asked for remote testimony. Which mamdam? "The interpreter unfortunately walked into the tail rotor of a helicopter last week 
45:32,48:13, #madam. @paul 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Dominic you noticed that too this morning?! I like interpreters hairstyle. Sounded like this witness daughter might have felt threatened and he reported the call to the commission? lucky only one side off pls lets respect the interpreter 😂😂😂😂😂😂 "Paul 
48:51,50:52, Judge is bi lingual. No way Mr X is anonymous anymore. multi Only Gideon Niewoudt was termed as Mr Ex in TRC hehe "@Dominic Przybylski He wants to remain anonymous to the broader community. He knows the Myenis know who he is Do you know who he is @Dominic Przybylski ? @Diss & Dad I think it should continue indefinitely - until all the criminals are behind bars. Exposes corruption and acts as deterrent. @Diss & Dad This will drag on for years unfortunately "@Gareth Hellyar No 
50:57,54:19, "@Fana They knew he was coming here today anyway. @Gareth Hellyar and those people will make sure everybody else does. @Diss & Dad I don't think he has yet but I think he should be given one. we want to see X why he dont want us to see him coz his lying Interpreter - haai anginawo amaningi.. @Diss & Dad I would like to see a permanent forum where the criminals can be grilled and shamed on national tv. Hopefully that'll put them off. heebana is this a best interpret in south africa we can get just asking Agreed Derek 
54:46,56:21, fuzile dazana - ungaze ubuze yey!! it's fine Remember the Afrikaans interpreter? they made it up jojo tanks 2007 now they rely no who you are the best I smell orange overalls in this commission now. @Paul Buchel I saw it as a mere joke...WITHOUT disrespect... "@Thabelo Emmanuel Interpreter naye akekho sure - its gonna be a long one hehe 
56:24,58:18, I've just seen latest BEE proposal for ICT companies. If they don't give 30% of their company to black owners they can be fined up to R5million or get jail sentence of up to 2 years. im telling you This is such a beautiful and competent interpreter... "@Fana Nkosi​ what is ICT again? Paul it's fine let's leave it Information Communication Technology - ie. software. The whole of Inkhandla is now covered with R250 000 worth of JOJO tanks "@Diss & Dad I'm not sure but I put my faith in Zondo. Perhaps the format could be relooked at for a more permanent ""live"" court?" 
58:19,1:01:05, ah thanks de l ukumemukelela Zasha - le interpreter nayo iyaphelelwa @Diss & Dad My father came from Poland after 2nd world war and his family home was expropriated without compensation by communist government. I was born in SA. iyabheda le toloki bakwethu "De klerk has apologized about his statement  Udidwa ukuthi akulula ukutolika isilungu usiyise esiZulwini Why didn't they invite Bathabile Dlaminis interpreter from the SASSA matter 
1:01:05,1:02:50, Interpreter is poor @Diss & Dad I reckon he has assistance to manage it all. I'm sure he sits down after each session and organises the info. A mammoth task but not impossible. @fuzile dazana Yoh man wrong stream. This here is state capture... Start that nonsense somewhere else. Chat is in agreement here Stick to the topic @fuzile dazana . @fuzile dazana thats my concerned DA is quiet on this matter @Diss & Dad It seems that expropriation without compensation runs in my family. "Mr X is also corrupt  he is corrupt indeed True 
1:02:54,1:04:23, He's coming clean now He is a corruptionist😀😁😂 He was born corrupt "@Diss & Dad There was no apartheid when my father came to SA and yes what was the big business in Richards bay that closed or is closing linked to Guptas. Umlungisis uzithela isisilo - Dudu organises a job for this comrade and he comes to snitch haaai bafethu!! "@Diss & Dad If Zondo wasn't managing Anne M. 👍👍 You cannot say babu you dont know how old is he? Rather refer to him Mnumzana Majola 
1:04:27,1:07:07, Craft!! @Sthakathi Khumalo He is a spy Money laundering scheme Money laundering.. "@Sthakathi khumalo. Well thats what we what the know Who is this Mr X? Fuzile please stay on this subject been talked about. @TINYIKO Makondo He is a brother of Mr Y😀😁😂 is time for the Hawks to act tonight. this evidence is direct. 
1:07:12,1:07:59, "@Diss & Dad Yes @TINYIKO Makondo he's talking y in order to go z "@Diss & Dad Thought you said you were East German? What's with the ""our indigenous people""?" "Anne M. thats the sad part @ Tinyiko do you Wanda kill him ? Mbuso Ndlovu ama2000 says he is a snitch lols Remember when Mandela publicly stated there was not going to be a gravy train and fat cats in the ANC?😂 the implicated persons knows who is this Mr X. its pointless fr him to hide his identity 
1:08:02,1:09:32, we are here because of the apartied legacy halt dein Maul @Diss & Dad My father was always against racial discrimination and had many altercations with the police about the existing laws. @Diss & Dad what is the point you are trying to make ? "Sibusiso Mthokozisi Dubazana into ebuhlungu are the death threats nje @Sthakathi Khumalo And death threats mean they have something to hide and Mr X is telling the truth. this is an interesting testimony of Mr X indeed its senseless because they knew him. How much was this money?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? 
1:09:34,1:12:59, @Diss & Dad You never mentioned before that you're east german. You said you were in Germany but not that you originated from there. Anne M. Dont get me wrong - I am not saying he is lying but this talks to should you assist people especially those struggling by any means and if one day an investigation comes is it okay to snitch "@Diss & Dad  @Diss & Dad Easy to blame people from a distance which allows you to claim shades of grey as black and white. So there was no cut for him as the medium for moving the money? sing like a bird Did he really betrayed Mr Majola?.be carefully X coz Majola is watching u No cut.. "Anne M. Fully agree 
1:13:19,1:15:43, x+y=Zuma The guy is singing shame @D Thomas it links Singing a nice Zulu tune.😃 Mr X is a International Snitch miss hofmeyer pls get a competent interpreter This guy should turn state witnesses against the perpetrators. After this testimony he and his family are not safe at all the hairstyle causes the translator to forget other things money laundering🤕 
1:15:44,1:16:30, He is. This is just simply theft. No pretences. The ARR aircraft parts shakedown was more sophisticated. @Themba Ntshingila she sounds pretty competent to me. You should have heard the Afrikaans interpreter at Neil Agett inquiry. Now that was horrendous... obvious money laundering @Diss & Dad Nats were against everybody who was not Afrikaans. It was many years before a non-Afrikaaner was allowed to play rugby as a Springbok. Tommy Bedford was famous for being the 1st. 😂😂😂😂 He's losing his mind @Fana Nkosi Spot on. "@Sthakathi Khumalo I think the commission already has the facts. If he lies under oath the interpreter is losing her mind too 
1:16:30,1:18:09, I still need an answer to my question. Why is it always MR X and NOT Y or Z? anyone knows? "@Talk Sick Majola going to sun city prison Mr X is spilling the beans and acting innocent as though he always knew that the will be a commission of inquiry. straight mmmmmmmmmmm MAJOLA "I@Pastor J Who knows? Although Mr Y could be confusing as the person might think he is being asked ""why""." Cross examination will throw Mr X under the bus Usihlalo also complained Pastor J 
1:18:23,1:19:34, "Anne M. Fair enough does anyone remember Willie Bassons Afrikaans interpretor? that was hilarious. Why not? Ans. I knew it was wrong.😱 "She's trying guyz That make some sense @Anne M. money into your account makes you an accomplice even if you didn't spent it Interpreter is getting confused "Pastor J Why Pastor 'J' rather than 'Q'. As in James Bond. 
1:20:08,1:21:50, @Colleen Arezio That explanation really makes sense "i see a clueless men who was taken advantage of Because it is my name @Concerned South African.hahahahaha @Fana Nkosi This madala should have ran with this money and dissappear to Dubai 😀😁😂😎 @Diss & Dad That was the impression of most white South Africans who were not Afrikaans. obvious bafo Mr X an accomplice thru n thru. unless he gets some immunity. he should go down too. change of heart does not equate to innocence "Mbuso Ndlovu my thing is udlile yena "the following anonymous witness will Mr Y 
1:22:00,1:23:05, Mashobane u so right He understood everything he is not innocent also let Mr X snitch on Majola "@Diss & Dad When I was conscripted was the first time I met Afrikaaners and when I confronted them about apaartheid @Sidney P ...hahahahaha There is no Honour Amongst Thieves where is this MAJOLA man? "Zwide iyangmangaza lensizwa He never said he is innocent like Agrizzi 
1:23:07,1:25:20, majola must be investigated for death threats to Mr X Mr X knows how to pretend he knows everything very well "all i want to knw is who is Majola? Who is Majola? Majola is coming to the commission. Mr X is very funny "Mr X singing @Pheladi when he is coming? 
1:25:28,1:29:21, Majola definitely will have to appear. He is heavily implicated. think his attorneys are in there watching n listening "logalakajane uyayazi kahle into ayikhulumayo "@Diss & Dad They had never been exposed to an alternative perspective Pholoba isgebengu loX "I'm not sure when but Kate said something to the effect Mr X will be able to answer the cross examination questions ask by Lawyers of Majola Emmanuel X was a willing n profiting participant Ntokozo Ngcobo as for ungeklekejane😂😂😂 "@Thabani Mkhatshwa According to him 
1:29:47,1:32:48, Chair has got him -lols He knew along shame and it was a corrupt deal we are all victims of the propaganda machine of the global elites It seem the deal was designed for him to be a scapegoat once it went sideways. I think dat why he is singing today "@Diss & Dad I've been here then and now Looks like it @Sibusiso Mthokozisi Dubazana 🙄🤔 2. 1 million @Diss & Dad Compare Julius Malema to Eugene Terreblanche. The similarities are striking. 
1:33:02,1:33:59, "Imali misangena bekumnandi shame "think the scenario is : He was cold haha Please lets all stick to the topic. im watching the commercial about hearingloss "Oh its natural Get with the program. @Diss & Dad When did you last visit South Africa? 
1:34:04,1:35:31, watholani ngoba uyakhala uthi kwakusala lutho hearclear ubuye adideke unkunzana azikhuze uma esefuna ukukhombisa ukuthi uyasazi isilungu @Diss & Dad Eugene Terreblanche wasn't a government official either. Margareth try harder she musta got gum stuck on 1 side of her hair diverting from the issue at hand LOOLS - the mind runs away sometimes I dont think Terblanch was a government official either. 
1:35:57,1:38:23, stampgate @Diss & Dad both had racial/fascist approaches. hai Is this evidence based on amounts appearing on his business Bank statement? "she drank Did he receive some of these funds?? " she has a zipstick in one of her braids-thats how she got the files out Awuzwa ke - bekwimfihlo

1:39:37,1:40:55, the interpreter is killing it 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾 @Diss & Dad Both approach the problem from race. I prefer not to base an argument on race because then it is simply a case of reaching a conclusion based on melamin. Killing it or killing it? Block @Sandlot Squinrts We seem to be in the midst of someone with some serious emotional challenges.....or a sticky keypad Liken in nailing it? BLOCKED @Ntokozo Ngcobo he's now playing u victim. Akuma Range Rover eZululand by these people.

1:43:52,1:45:38, @Diss & Dad We aren't going to get anywhere in this discussion. Let's concentrate on the inquiry. Mr X is using muthi on our BEAUTIFUL Interpreter @Pumza And I love her tone of voice too.. Paid by Clomat 2 394 000. she is laughing 2m "@Diss & Dad I agree - Malema does raise relevant issues that resonate with a large amount of SAfns. If only he didn't always couch his comments in race politics "yeyi brazo Linda aqede umtoliki noma ukhuluma isingisi
