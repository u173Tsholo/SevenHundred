Check your brakes before you drive 
39:18,40:34, @ Thabang Lentsoana. Gunned down like they would have record of corrupt payments in his books. Payment was made in bags of cash same as Guptas. so this guy is saying that he knew about those initials that he said he didn't know he was shot executional style.

1:41:15,1:44:05, Mr Sodi invest in a trust Undercover business Bra.......... Exactly chair.... because he's not being truthful and not at all convincing.... Grill him Chair......... What share is in the contract? heeeeeh lendoda he's used to this..... he doesn't want to leave tails behind. apart from the fact that I'm lying """whatever share"" indicates he doesn't know what's in the contract." mr frank j grass sold my ahsma vaccien to india japan shout korea n now in russia but 7 years only 1 cent i did not grt money from sell my vaccien yet.

1:47:29,1:50:05, Whites invest their business in trust. so that they can hire family and not comply with EE It's a sham "Don't have to be a ""legal person"" to see that it is a dicey contract." exactly... This guy Sodi is that awkward moment when one sing the wrong lyrics loud with confidence🙈😅🤷🌟 @Refiloe Nkabinde ....No......cause what they do is legal etc etc...get it Bra..... state capture inquiry = how to get rich in South Africa how when the contract doesn't include you??? It's obvious that he had no claim on the property because it was not a joint investment. It was nothing more than a bribe. 
1:50:22,1:52:05, This chair is weak we need someone willing to make decisive decision based on our constitution but the avert a lot of legislation "R650 how can they allow him to continue saying such nonsense Lies Lies and more lies woo hoo - too many coincidences DKD unfortunately we don't have those people in south africa..

HE BANNA....... THIS IS BULL..... THIS GUY .... don't mess with Rupert We are watching Lying 101. 
1:56:18,2:00:00, the value is the only profit. This guy is sharp the problem with this guy is that he doesn't read..... the contract states otherwise.. @Diana..If BEE is removed what is the alternative..South Africa needs a form of affirmative action lying what kind of business transaction is this..... what are we watching .......... this guy is digging himself a really big hole😂 doesn't he know the first rule if lying..keep your responses short..or cry amnesia 😂 This is useless like the TRC It is all smoke and mirrors:goodvibes:
