They are making a killing @Anne M. let all evidence come out @dm70 The commission already has the evidence before the witnesses give testimony. They intentionally disregarded the statutes pertaining to procurements and tenders. "The commission team are cross checking the evidence 
17:11,18:12, the public must hear they stole our money period Annie M. are you saying this inquiry is also a shamble on repeat lol 'locomotive supplier Swifambo Rail Leasing has lost a Supreme Court of Appeal challenge to a High Court order that stripped it of a R3.5bn tender with Prasa.

35:39,36:58, "we need to do away with this ANC they think nothing of the poor people @david jacobs Is there something called collective responsibility in law? mzalwane mzala some names myeni nomvula zwane gigaba gwede and the list go on 80% of nec 80% of list no shame no dignity @Mzalwane Mzala no its the ANC thinktank that thought about it The EFF has vowed to kick the DA out of those municipalities it supported them in I for one cannot believe this level of thieving was unknown by some in Parliament and most of the SOE Boards. Suspension prior to a fair trial would have worked. @Mzalwane Mzala You heard about that coming from Zizi Kodwa "The thieves even captured parliamentary committees 
37:20,38:54, "@#dm70 worry not you are only left with few hours to out vote them @david jacobs I thought we were dealing with criminaly punishing looters. This level of corruption is sickening and effects all of us. they stole money from us period I have already voted in UK.

38:55,40:16, I mean this corruption is everywhere. lol All polls point to an increase in EFF support. i as a South African expect prosecutions to happen EEF will emerge victorious this time. It's imminent. people must be jailed "All SOE's are funded by you and I DA will get atleast 35% All polls point to an decrease in DA support.

43:18,44:09, Let us quote the Polls @Douglas Beadle SA is rich in human and a host of other resources but thanks to Zuma it is in ruins the DA has service delivery that speaks for itself EFF will be a disaster for this country seems tha this person lnew a lot but did not eat shushi or curry but also did not do due diligence despite these corruption allegations against the ANC I still believe the ruling party will win these elections...i bless u ANC. Can someone still vote even if is not registered for this year voting. But I did vote in another province in 2009. I say that as a jozi boy that's visited capetown These people are so rotten and cruel.Ministers and CEO's were changed to facilitate this grand scale of looting.They knew someone at the top was protecting them thats why they are still arrogant. 
44:25,45:17, IRR place the ANC at 54.7% fire a xenophobic govt Perhaps let's pause the imaginary perception about the election results until the announcement is made next week. so you bles criminals hibo EFF are just noise makers but not ideal leaders "@Magda Seguin . 100% true Future generations and the youth will judge the ANC for stealing their future.It will take another 25 years to heal the country And what happens if 1 party gets 50% exactly or so? "ANC voters - you lose the right to complain about corruption 
45:22,47:34, the way the DA is seen is a result of the only way the ANC gets votes by making everything black and white "@Douglas Beadle you are right IRR which is led by pro DA liberals places the DA at 21.8% "DA isn't racist We have no guarantee that CR will fire the thieves ANC can only survive by dividing people - SA will not survive much longer The DA's list is made up of 58% white reps in a country that is over 70% black DA will even see a decline in the western cape because Aunt Patricia will gain votes from them "#dm70 it is due to the divisive race politics of the EFF

Ace was left to his own devices electioneering about race 1992 referendum "SA should adopt a diferent election policy @Thando Nkutha At some point I thought you were an EFF supporter my brother. has there been a change of attitude or was I wrong? EFF doesn't have a strategy beyond Zuma and land grabbing Eff will bring about another Zimbabwe .... 
50:51,56:19, NO TAX = NO BUGet to waste. What i can not argue against is that the EFF is likely to govern the City of Tshwane after these elections and the DA have acknowledged that by placing the current mayor on their provincial list. I will not be shocked if they bring Floyd to be the mayor. There is no brain matter in the EFF just simple minded thugs. we need to think economically and stop this locality business. ANC is looting resources and I don't see them being sent to jail because all of them have smolanyana skeletons "4th industrial digital be ready world is changing said mr Ramaphosa honestly EFF can't move beyond land grabs and Zuma. ask them what their strategy is moving forward and you will get dololo answer. 😀 "I once saw her at CT airport prancing around

I leave 'want' to you. "ANC is about to move with you for next destinations forward with factory "Egni my problem with eff is they want to nationalize everything after we just had to sell eskom and telkom just to make the infrastructure function and he wants everything to be government run The EFF is a simple minded party of hoodlums that think that everything will be free as we know otherwise and i do not say that it is political mitivated bur hienays crimes and eff and blf helping along with hate speech you can't lead a nation when you have no respect like EFF and BLF The small business minister was always the most vocal in parliament supporting Zuma and calling the DA racists...I really hope she is on the CR list of thinning out ..her name is still on the list 
1:00:30,1:03:31, they advocate for government owning all business when government cant handle their current responsibilities it's simply madness "Malena himself is guilty of tax evasion who is paying the blf "By voting ANC and depending on one man is very risky EFF are just on cloud 9. they strategy is not feasible. it's just a 2 year old dream Remember Cyril won at Nasrec on a very narrow margin Val Speirs I thought Mizzotti was a cigarette smuggler or something Now there are rumours that NDZ may become deputy president..maybe it's just speculation but one can never know what they are planning behind the scenes but you need regitration money for each ward you are runnung for and a lot of money and then the 1 taxi they had to hire for their suporters

1:10:23,1:12:47, @makhosi nobhatyi if what CR keeps saying is anything to go by we are likely to see a better ANC government. Technically he states that the auditing system is also corrupt? "When I see children still being taught under tress The problem is that these guys do business with the same SOEs through their children. Most of them feel entitled to everything in SA resources because of struggle credentials. All of them are eating!
