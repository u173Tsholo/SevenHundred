I take it the DCJ has the names of these code names being used I wish people listen n see this nonsense corrupt ANC There is country in the world which is corruption free I hope somebody big or well-connected is arrested for our sake. please go home Nigeria We don't need you here Even if they arrested they will live like kings in jail will have everything Yeah but these ANC cadres were overdoing it while throwing it in our faces. It didn't help that they looked untouchable because they had made sure law enforcement was nonfunctional 
16:51,22:21, No arrest will happen here is just ANC playing us fools At least something will be seen to be done look at vbs Jail is like a free Bead and Breakfast to the politicians Now Ramaphosa sending delegation to go and apologise to the Drug Lord to come back n destroy our youths Appologise for WHAT???? its a pity that we are led by leaders who cant differentiate between the ruling party and the state..they can even defend others with their backside. Apologise for Xenophobia n attacking Nigerians We do not need to appologize for saving our country and youths we have been putting up with this and we are not stipid..they will regret this oneday.

The problem with South Africa we take so long to act @Lorraine Naidoo I am just as frustrated as you are.

We are patiently waiting.. we need them on the streets or backroom shacks begging for bread and milk. "@Mbuso Ndlovu Sadly 
1:50:40,1:54:56, what do you do if the courts are captured judges and prosecutors are already captured. @zintle ndzwangu Agree. Too many people are suffering because money was eaten by these corrupters. nope we will keep on looting maybe smaller scale but it is part of human trait NOT a human trait. shower shower on my head who has the brains when i am dead I also doubt much can be done at the rate things are going. Given half a chance most of us would have looted too. Funny enough! Still doesnt make it right tho... @News Update i would say flawed 
1:55:24,1:59:13, We even bribe them to give us a world cup which we benefited nothing from it. What a waste "@Yin Yang If you say so hey... But i did say ""Given a chance""." i even loot the peanut buter out of the jar @Yin Yang I salute you. @Gee Peex1 ouch that hurts me thanks I want to know Who/What is company X I have never ever stole in my life "...Corruption"" is"" because money is: anything that satisfies as a payment."
