time,4:38,message how convenient for mr Majola to fall ill he is pulling a Zuma @Gabisile Mabuza stress.... He knows whats coming Every one seems to fall ill when they come under the spotlight. Hidehodee all Majola running afraid His stomach is probably also running ha ha ha I'd also be feeling very ill 
4:58,10:00, 🤣🤣🤣 What's this about Mr Majola being ill? What happened? Dudu myeni will report sick also. thieves r we still busy with mr x? @Moshoeu Mabusela - she's dodging everything They can't run/hide or be sick forever though @ERika unless they die Agreed! and then she's gets defensive 
10:39,15:05, SAA evidence is still coming also for her. shame mr x No shame. They're just having fruits of their deeds mr x is volumeless today or its me? "Buhle by information from Rose's head brain talk way Camera person and the empty chair😂😂 Now all the volume is off. whos empty chair? 
15:47,19:10, no chairman? Mr X @Buhle Mr Xs chair it means no interuption Is Majola still around or has he run off? X Y and Z thanks "Majola he cried himself into dehydration status. 
20:57,23:58, "Excuse my poverty Lol Michael😁 jz foundation😳😳😳😳😳😳 JZ Foundation as corrupt as the Clinton Foundation. I'm confused. When doing transfers don't we put in account holder and number? @Pheladi Lamola I was thinking the same thing.. We learned alot from the USA system! hmmmm lying maybe they do transfers like they do in Zim through your phone with only your cell number. 
23:58,28:52, They will retrieve the SMS's and maybe he kept all the notes he took. I should have worked for Mr X. I would be rich but not under the radar😋😋😋 Mr x was doing so well.... Now they'll start to question his credibility 😕 secretary and daughter must be summoned ASAP 🤣🤣🤣 Mr X I've also never done internet transfers. Does it require the account holder as well? Or the account number only? It does require account holder judge just hit nail on the head with the hammer. @CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE you can put anything on the account holder 
29:06,31:16, Yes it does require both "And if the account holder and account nr don't match you won't be able to pay @Erika Bown not necessarily "You can link two accounts zuma name is always mention when money disappear maybe the secretary had a list to match account holder to account number. and would use that. she must know a lot too. "@Musa Mabunda ok "the system will merely alert you the account number already exists on your beneficiaries' ist "Ah ok 
31:48,35:13, JGZF Mr X knows more than his saying. Nobody can have millions come and go from account not get paid and still you dont care to know anything about the sender or beneficiary. Something fishy. "They share stolen money @Erika Bown Tx But did this people ever thought that all this will come out or tracible he would also be making interest depending how long the funds stayed in his account. Zuma and Myeni was destroying mr X career and company by using his company to do money laundering 😳😳😳 "@Musa Mabunda So it's possible that Mr Xs secretary could transfer the money without the account holder's details makhosi spot on!!!! 
35:30,37:07, should do a comm of enquiry into jacob zuma trust..or banks must close account of the trust Mr X is intelligent. "It’s amazing how Mr. X is in charge of so much money y banks allowed moneys in trust @Brian Mercado my thoughts exactly! @CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE details that matter is the account number hence you can also transfers money by a cellphone number linked to the account number "@Brian Mercado He relied on his secretary 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ Zuma is evil @ Matt Tylor no one should go to support him to the court otherwise something will happen Mr X was only the puppet of many strings!! 
37:18,39:36, "But anyway "@Luegi Msomi it is painful indeed Think other people will come forward now that Mr x has given evidence opening a whole can of worms Michael wild can u and I open a consortium and start doing some shaddy deals looks like they are fast mr X had fallout with Myeni😯😯😯😯 Elvis not thanks I like to sleep well at night knowing I have not robbed from others. Thanks "Well if you rely on your daughter ZUMA IS EVIL!!!!! PERIOD Michael wild very true Michael 
39:58,43:00, @cassim suleman And so is DUDU!!! so evil..u cant bring him in your house..might try to screw your wife or daughter.. shameless corrupt and mercyless bunch of people He might leave with your cutlery dudu ..yes..bigtime rathermy cutlery..than a baby Zuma was enriching himself over our struggles "Mr X better have some protection because inKZN exactly Chair 
43:22,46:19, "@cassim suleman true Thalente insists Isibonelo did some work but doesn't have a record of what work was done. Go figure. "@Luegi Msomi That's why the community must protect him @luegi..he is dead...family is dead..u dealing with mafia "shocking  "MrX. u took your share too. R1.15 m in JZ is very clever. No trace of him receiving any money...a great chess move👏👏👏 @Clantonaqua he's some sort of Section 204 if you are au fait with the criminal procedure law Christopher Molefe he is not clever he is a crook but lies have short legs 
46:22,48:18, "@Christopher Molefe there is many dots joined today. "@Elvis Malakoane Yes "@CHRISTOPHER MOLEFE not that simple @Musa . it was just an observation Painful painful and sadness 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ please remove mr x @Clantonaqua i was merely commenting on that observation dudu was not supposed to be on water board as her period expired..but she still forced herself on board "@makhosi nobhatyi But her being the chair of the foundation is not evidence that he received cash. That we know from conventional wisdom 
48:48,51:36, @Musa Mabunda . Sure @Elvis Malakoane Not only JZ a crook - he's a coward too. the name of the holder the number - at least that's what I need his brains got rewired in robben island ..made him a devil Derek Main very true Derek "@Jacqui Baumgardt name of holder you can put anything my bank won't accept that @Musa Mabunda - they reject the transaction the name and the number must stack up Yes my bank also rejects 
52:42,56:09, bank will hassle small guys..but allow big guys to go unquetioned Qgqih wabatshwa @cassim suleman Exactly - the big guys don't have to follow the same rules we ordinary mortals do. Majola took unadvantage of uneducated person wabanjwa Mr x Wabanjwa Mr X explain yhoo lies are not permanent "@Jacqui Baumgardt names can change anytime uNamangwa Yerrrrrr 
56:47,1:01:31, arrest didi immediately dudu "Laws SABC stop it. You're hurting our ears brudda osas awewewewe Mr X was going to be arrested for money he didn’t used He is an intelligent uneducated man. he cant even listen properly to what is asked from Zondo...he did not ask what cell number was used....They play in circles like every other person involved 
1:02:04,1:05:02, Protection please DCJ give mr x @makhosi nobhatyi Witness protection is being provided did write the conversation down and leave the transcript at office. his hiding. why protection if he did not do what was right in the begin? should have spilled the beans. Judge is linking dots "Mmmm.... Sounds a bit dodgy now. First he does remember (yesterday) For how long? This guy needed for life even his company@ Ann M I think it's nerves Erika. But man was gullible really 
1:05:33,1:07:14, he is under protection Makhosi That JZF must be investigated I sincerely hope it is that. We need him to be truthful so these people don't find any loopholes @makhosi nobhatyi I don't know. I don't think the death threats are going away any time soon. 👍 They brought that apon themselves so they in all fairness take what comes with the situation. You don't have to be educated to remember what you said yesterday and say now today... JZF involved in money laundering Thanks @ Yolo More 
1:07:28,1:09:37, 👏👏👏👏👏👏Mr X maybe the job was beyond his ability "X appears to be sharp and with it thanks Mr x Ive just worked out whats up with the auto translate 😃 I'm scared for him too when I think of the political killings in KZN. JZ and his ilk will not leave him alone 👏👏👏👏👏👏🤝🤝 He is 👌👌👌👌👌 viva Mr X 
1:09:44,1:11:50, 😂 Yes Mr X needs to be applauded for his courage Shocker...... Thank you Mr X We are all thankful Mr x such a brave man. should receive a medal. proud of being a South African. He is indeed sharp Now that he has testified he should be safe because those implicated well be the first suspects and they would be wary not to aggravate their situation He's scared shame. Pleading with his community 
1:11:53,1:14:16, "The problem is we don't arrest We always knew they up to their ears in corruption along with many others. Just needed all this proof for the courts He is scared "@Vish Govender No So no Mr Majola? "No he has the Zuma bug. sickashell Where is Mr Majola? Very true Anne but the supporter will be careful so that those they support dont get arrested
