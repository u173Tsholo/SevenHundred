They ruined "@L L he is not too bad at he is coming clean unlike some corrupt comrate of anc mxm @cameron.. 😊 "i think south African should see this and start to think about voting for a new party that will lead us. but there is one thing i wish we can all keep in mind This commission has shown that not many people has the guts to come forward with info on corruption...quite a few state employees resigned instead of revealing the rot lets vote eff 
16:00,17:54, At least he has a consceince unlike the leaders and co-conspirators of this country. @bongumusa ellon we need to scap all parties and have a internatal organasation ruling SA for a minumum 10 year cool down period so guys do you think the Gupta brothers will ever come to testify in this commission or chances are high that it might end without them telling their sides of the story????

20:20,22:08, fearless daredevil Agrizzi . much respect to him Government and Busasa same Whats app Group mnxn "If you could follow up this individual is greedy guys bare in mind that SA has jst signed an extradition with AUE(dubai) meaning Zondo can order for the arrest of the Guptas for them to be deliverd in SA within a week!!!! meaning its up to zondo now "@bongumusa ellon If you think a political party will help you and the rest of the 50 million Africans where will the money come from  What about EFF and VBS would you let a convicted pedophilia work at a school of young children......then why would you vote EFF when Malema has already done corruption. and some of the other leaders in EFF too. "that is true i have to help my self this guy is forever fearless 
22:13,23:22, @King Stash The Guptas is well secured in India What about their open inflammatory remarks that are obviously meant to stir up the masses The extradition order will still take time..it has already been signed a few months ago VBS money started EFF @bongumusa ellon start from the bottom and build you up - normally it takes a live to do that I used to love the EFF now I will never vote for them Bandit why i take that advice thank you Im voting EFF

Only solution is EFF Guptas cant enter India they waiting for them for corruption there too. the three brothers are stuck in Dubai. I’m voting EFF No I loved them because they addressed a need of millions of poor people that were ignored by everybody else sup suppenhansln if it wasnt for EFF no one would have new about Guptas and State Capture "Gillingham lived off taxpayers money..his entire family benefited 
24:43,25:02, The EFF will steal everything they will be worse than anything we are seeing now. only dumb people will vote for that Effing party. We need the truth as it is mr Agrizzi so that these ANC politicians crooks can go down.

"@Magda Seguin you will soon get heart attack - you need to chill @Cameron Kim uhm that exchange rate was maintained by manipulation and the forced labour of millions of people. No thanks Zuma has no intelligence its the dumber against the dumb EFF who will fix Exdom and how. who has the experience in EFF to plan and run Exdom we need names we need A solution. please name the guy mr agrizzi

30:52,32:02, ANC will win bcos their voters know nothing abt corruption. Son of the soil your pants with EFFluent The best will be if no party gets majority and a coalition will be forced to govern meaning that there will be accountability as in Gauteng and Western Cape "Noted @Yin Yang Youtube is not your platform - go wash dishes or something @magda I agree that’s why I say best strategy is vote for smaller parties with local power bases @Myka'Al Daud true you guys are too gullible. you believe lies dressed as promises and that's how the anc robbed the poor But then the son of the soil turned bad.......the soil poisoned him........hehe 
32:20,33:20, @Ying Yang No EFF slander shall be tolerated😈 if he is a son of the soil he is a plant "yes he is a plant @Briony that lack of empathy bleeds through What is blind love for a party when they screw the poor SO THY WILL VOTE FOR IT AND MOST OF YOUNG PEOPLE WILL VOTE FOR ANC. @Briony French you perhaps a slow thinker "IFP will be underdogs in these elections banditsa the poor have done this to this country. you dont ask a liar to keep coming to your house. 
33:24,33:57, Wt pains us.our own government said we must own companies at the same time.they are doing this.wt is the point tenders ha ha ha ha THAT IS A FACT "@ french @BanditZA is our leader going to last 3 tears? "Hate or Love since madiba the anc died ONLY FOOL WIL VOTE FO ANC Bas in 1894 the NIC Natal Indian CONGRESS was established. In 1912 The ANC was established.

LET US WATCH BUSASA THEN AFTER THAT IT WILL BE THE END AS IF WE ARE WATCHING A MOVIE @Jeevan I thought about that but as a people Indians don’t have enough votes promising things he cant guaranty is not a leader. it's a joker.

Wait until he hands in his list of MP'S & family who benifitted... Wait. Family members on payroll 🤔 CAN WE BE TOLD THE NAMES Mr Keiswetter is our new commissioner of SARS.. yippee the end of corruption at SARS We need to change the system so that we vote directly for MPs so that we can hold them accountable 
35:55,38:00, Is Agrizzi releasing names or just telling us what we already know. BECAUSE THIS PEOPLE HAVE NAMES LET THEM BE NAMED AND BE CALLED OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE CRIMINALS @BanditZA that will never happened - no power for the people ever He'll release names once he has proof. Yes I detest that EFFING thug Party not afraid of the thugs "All this others things he ll tell the judge in court THEN LET THEM NOT WATSTE OUR TIME I feel that the EFF has the right message for the wrong reasons "@welton paulse that's not true 
38:01,39:12, They are right in so many ways but then they throw it all away "Moody will not downgrade South Africa in the eve of the elections 🤔 Are you an economist @Joburg CEB Lion? 😂😂eff I cant c mr Maleka Camera man ngathi usethanda amantombazane nje Bandit. their slogan.

Manase it fit her.or wt? "@carnoth ngomane - dont be a child plz don't mention my name This sounds like stokvel doing rounds.....we missed our turns "@Ntombethemba Manase 
1:14:52,1:15:58, actually i hope Zondo is mentioned just for drama @Anne M. He said being arrested did not bother him as he was cooperating with the State.

1:17:18,1:18:29, @Derek Main its given that the majority of black voters vote for ANC and we will continue to do so than voting for a racist party Like DA @Charles Sambil I rather work for my own money Yin y @Wallace Mandimutsira exsumed.. @carnoth ngomane I'm no fan of the DA but only an idiot would vote for the ANC after hearing all this evidence of their corruption. This is a lesson never to be repeated in this country I'm thing what kids thinking about adults Bossasa was just the washing house for the ANC @Yin Yang we are together my leader MALEMA must be mention Writes in fountain pen 
1:18:49,1:19:35, @Anne M. It is possible that Mti pocketed the money or shared it with his former PA who is now suspended from the NPA.

By now after 25 years we should not be thinking along colour lines. what we need is is a party who can deliver services to the people. The ANC failed this for 25 years with corruption. "you see now "Zondo @Eslon Eslon Watson and his brother was hand in hand with the ANC since the 1970's "Elson Pls say Ministers names some praying Agrizzi left with only 1 code/ name to decipher
