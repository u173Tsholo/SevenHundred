7:37,10:55, "They might as well say his name  Brian Molefe the Guptas stooge "Open your eyes All corruption will be eradicated. never Why is this witness not being shown. Has he also got something to hide Blessed are the pure of heart. @ ADR that will not happen..there corruption is on the rise at least he is testifying and there is a record 
11:06,15:15, @Bev Daniels for safety reasons coz Brian always denied that he know Guptas he wont even be safe in Dubai this guy's life is in danger..no form of confidenciality! he is a liar Desperation by this commission is sad...🙇🏽‍♂️ lol we are going hear big news here indeed :yt: This guy is just telling things as they are 
15:24,17:42, total corruption tame sale it's a myth There is no stone will remain unturned nothing said by this guy and handlers make sense @dada true 🤞🏾 Dada could you please explain yourself? am a watching Uzalo here 😂😂😂😂 Haibo!! 
17:48,20:38, where did this person go to school the spelling really bad @ Brian this guy was just a driver and security.. Molefe will obviously dispute this it's embarrassing OMFG i am so glad i have left SA! these idiots could not find their way out of a paper bag dada you have an opportunity to make a statement to the commission . Please do so 😂😂😂😂 Sydney who are you referring to? there is no need to go through the whole log book pretorious is wasting time He has a log book? 
21:05,25:26, @ Sydney ..I hate corruption to the core bit out of all the borrowing this country has done and those waste of money is disgusting to me Any thief can dispute this successfully ARE WE TO BELIEVE THAT THE VIRUS STOPS WHEN YOU LOWER YOUR MASK TO SPEAK. LOL "I am very today what I am listening it’s a concrete evidence by the poor of the poor This life on Earth is a lesson to humanity that when sin thrives there is no peace. Destruction and chaos becomes manifested in such a world where sin is allowed to thrive. Learn this lesson. If I remember correctly Brian Molefe denied ever going to the Guptas' Saxonwold home? Brian Molefe by then claimed he went to a Shebeen 😂🙈😅 More people like drivers; security guards; secretaries etc should offer to give evidence the next set of thieves in government are learning from this stupid process..and will be sophisticated 
26:06,28:07, That was the day of the crocodile tears 😭 from Molefe I agree with you @ Brian "Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe has insisted that he never denied visiting the residence of the Gupta family in Saxonwold @ Dominic..do this commission and this anonymous have videos and pictures of him at guptas .. so Hope BM and his lying friends are in handcuffs today. What are the chances? Ex "@ Dominic Przybylski he even cried public on national television lol I remember - very famous case of crocodile tears. 
29:26,31:38, Brain never denied visiting Guptas stop lying 🙇🏽‍♂️ 2 guys were killed in kzn because they were exposing corruption regarding rdp houses. So be careful when exposing corruption. These people are demonic. Many people use witchcraft. dada ngova mobile phone location @ Bongani Gwamanda he denied that he visited on business meeting! Only go for sheebben Their judgement will be strict @makhosi please get your facts straight 🙏🏾 @Makhosi so what's the point of this guy dithering here what if molefe says I don't have a leather brown back pack Something out of The Godfather 
31:41,33:15, "I am quite confused Kindergarten at play here The state capture is bringing some real evidence Brian Moneybags Molefe 🔥🔥🔥💣 "@ Dada ngova this guy is here to testify about executive directors who he transported and guards Bloody 18 billion of covid money has been stolen..leave this ba kpack Uhh Idk what I’m doing here @Gwamada inference was that he never visited Guptas 
33:18,35:15, wait and see because it might nit make sense for you now but surely it does make sense for the commission "@Bongumenzi nothing yerrrrr Mr molefe nad bag I hope orange uniform is getting ready for him. and not end up talking only and no arrests @ makhosi he was just a driver..there is no proof he is telling the truth @Gwamada that is the reason there is circumstantial evidence kindergarten backwards league system "In addition to R25 million pension payout for a few months service he was also collecting ""backpacks"" of cash from ""Saxonwold"". Molefe must be swimming in money." 
35:18,36:44, Bongani Gwamanda if we cannot prove more than association how do we charge him of criminality?? @dada ngova he has record books and times addresses some of us talk as if we were there the times the corrupt state capture cabal were busy stealing...why defending the corrupt cabal You need to understand the law of evidence to get a proper grip of this evidence and why its being led Molefe still works for Defence Force even now Unholy behaviour can act as a door to bring demons into a person's life Love is the way. "Gugulethu Dube The world needs saving 
36:50,40:58, That may explain why Denel is bankrupt and cannot pay wages anymore. imagine the judge is listening at this bull...the world is laughing at a circus..people are dying from covid and hunger..just an hour ago an old lady passed on in the que waiting to be helped The justice system is corrupted The only inference to make is that State capture commission has more evidence to go with this bag empty/full bag evidence This life is a lesson. When you want to disobey The Lord be prepared to deal with the consequences Unfortunately many innocents suffer at the hands of the wicked The guptas must get done for having a Shebeen at their premises. Unliscenced... add that to the list Joined late. Which Molefe is this? A D R your statements argue your own statements 
41:00,42:03, Gigabyte why circumstances evidence would not cut it hi hi everyone @Bongumenzi Nxumalo you are correct they will kill these witnesses yes izinja yes bachara 
42:09,43:23, Did he want to say Siyabonga Gama? kalu how are you no Dont you know that this world is under the power of the evil ones. Humans have been left to deal with all this chaos. Those who stay dedicated to The Lord are worthy of being accepted and forgiven @ xolisa ezikhonkpthayo Yooooooooooh money son "Just joined "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood 
43:24,45:20, "@Bongumenzi evidence like this is always set not as direct evidence but as laying the ground to prove a major proposition who is this guy exactly the one who is body guard? Did he take some? Money laundering 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ "oh money money This witness beka thand iindaba moer !!! "Interesting "Humans are distracted to fight each other when our enemies are those in the spiritual realm nobody with all the brain will send anyone with a leather backpack with that amount of money 
45:31,47:32, Saxonwold Shebeen👌🏽 "This reminds me of Mokonyane & Bosasa I recognize this voice 😭😭😭😭 haha money printer go brrrr Brian Molefe denied any wrongdoing when he was accused at transnet I am surprise today what I heard 😳😳😳😷 "All this stuff is not what really matters This guy is wasting our time... NB most cases if not all are decided by the decision maker making a reasonable inference from the evidence profered where is the evedince 
47:40,49:43, A D R whats the big picture ? Karen always has a mask I hope moronic ret are listening... @ bongani cartoons ..the simpsoms Why don't governments help those poverty-stricken and war-torn countries? Yet so much money is spent on materialistic distraction and other nonsense. Where is the support? why did you not report that "Big picture? There is a spiritual war going on. Sin is being made to look attractive so that people don't go to heaven and receive blessings. What matters is being pure There is only one Lord. these corrupt crooks thought nobody is gonna investigate these shenanigans 
50:57,54:07, the guptas paid in cash. no evidence ADR : It's past your bath time. Off you go before the demons get you. Just look at the state of the world. Why is there so much confusion for many people regarding our origin? Life is more magical than you think. (1) Truth of the Molefe frequented the Gupta residence - inference Molefe had a relationship with the Guptas "Don't play with witchcraft though. Life is magical but dont play with evil magic All Elected Official in Africa are under the control of the 3 mmmm The Lord is the ruler of the universe. "Yooo! I can’t believe what am hearing here 
54:11,56:34, "(2) Evidence -Molefe always traveled with a bag to the Guptas DCJ must protect these folks surely some transnet employees knows him/them True Sammy Hebana I second that Sammy this is bull...these people will just end your life this is breaking news. but tomorrow molefe will deny same old story it would appear that the implicated already know the witness; why is he still hiding then? (3) Evidence of the frequent visit between the Guptas and Molefe - inference there was a well established relationship between the Guptas and Molefe 
56:58,59:03, ITS ALL A MASQUERADE!!! who is testifying now? why would you risk your life "The sun is going down for all the crooks Unidentified 😲😲😲 """if you love your life i just hope when he must be cross examined on these allegations he wont run AWOL.. eg Pravin Gordon This is so painful guys 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ Hayi amasela ayabulala 
59:22,1:03:12, (4) The relationship between the Guptas and Molefe - taken with the evidence of the businesses of the Guptas- proves a collusive behavior. So true makhosi I wish to have the board guard for Tom Moyane also Gordhan never ran away - it is for judge Zondo to decide whether cross questioning is needed. This is not a court. paranoia msuzo "Zondo commission must move this driver/guard if he’s staying at Soweto let say u need protection Mr witness no 1 OTHERWISE they are going to kill you "Gordhan will come here don’t worry guys 
1:03:20,1:07:40, They must pay for his security why put your self in danger ? why risk it. for what? 18 billion was stolen last 2 months..that will never end ..start Learning we just want to know the truth about all that was happening in the 9 years of Zuma. and hoping all the corrupt will finally be brought to book. @Ndaxola Mdrai I think Gordhan is not scared to face anything as Moyane always accuse Gordhan for discrimination and take him as a boy remember back 2012/2013 he emphasized that on 📺 Nobody threatened this liar speaking at Zondo commission this is all a political witch hunt @dada ngova 😂😂😂😂😂😂....Yourright and is not going to end now he should avail himself for cross examination and not come up with excuses this guy got a bomb ppl try something else Keith Odwa 
1:08:11,1:09:41, @Ndaxola we also need to know what happened to R500bln that just disappeared in 4 months 🙇🏽‍♂️ "@Keith Odwa please shut up this is not a joke Come on Keith. Evidence One is meticulous 👌👌 Please Keith stop it "If Gordhan is already making excuses Thieves are now painting themselves as victims.. @ makhosi you will have a heart attack due to this muppet show..pull yourself together Thank you Witness 1. You are 
1:09:58,1:12:27, true hero of SA omnye next hamba witness 2 loading... What is this test 1 2 test "these are serious allegations against Brian Molefe. i dont think he will live them unchallenged. and if he does challenge them "@Bongumenzi Nxumalo if you remember that Gordhan sin was to see money that was going out of this country by politicians well known and dodge sars Rogue unity 
1:12:33,1:17:31, y not arrest all thifss only in SA will the secret witness be revealed because someone did not turn the camera off They can take Gordhan to court if they want South Africa did you hear a 96hours minister trying to be a politically smarter... lol Jacob Zuma? he he he he Kulele kunye ngabekubili ngabe kuyavusana..zuma..zuma niyagula aniyeke u Nxamalala 
1:18:06,1:22:13, These witnesses will withdraw their evidence when challenged like Vytjie Mentor Jonas did .They have been set up by a cabal . witness no 1 you beauty take a bow sir. "@Melusi sikakane uyanya kwedini ngoku tell us witness 2 "Akuwona umuziwakho lo Siyabonga Gama>>>Saxonwold @melusi n makhosi you arguing over nothing Susungxolela wena apha ngamasela @ Melusi sikakane makhosi .unyanisile 
1:22:41,1:25:32, binod Rasheed Ally - which cabal - are you in cahoots with the Guptas? How can all the logs and the codes found by Thuli be wrong? Remember the shebeen in the area. vamos barca "@melusi you are right Haha this is stuped vamos barca so the zondo circus encourages faceless nameless witnesses bit denied Molefe to cross question previous witnesses .A transparent judiciary I thought it was . true so many cars- yerr for one person 
1:25:40,1:28:20, people want to politicize stealing. Stealing from public is crime "dammit top of d range vehicles @Ally what interests do have in these inquiries @ Rasheed its rubbish ..shows how desperate they are in finding faults Stealing is stealing - period "@Dumisani Sebeko ur correct my brother "Rasheed Ally - you talk nonsense. The Commission has instructions and is following its mandate. It is not a court of law. If Molefe wants to cross question Range Rover Vogue "People in country staying on squatters 
1:28:21,1:30:02, sbusiso fairness to get to the truth . not anonymous evidence to get media excited . If Molefe feels he is slandered he can sue the witnesses. SALUTE! very true Rasheed Is this a Commission or Lifestyle Audit? this commission is vile "state capture has robot witnesses Yhooo another cars guys Someone inform Molefe he might consider Dubai coz I saw a order of orange jumpsuits from correctional services 
1:30:13,1:31:50, tbh I don't know why I clicked on this. If a witness can show he is threatened then of course he can be kept out of the public eye. The witness must live to tell: ANC assassinates the sound effect is irritating. someone speaking with closed nose "molefe Same Gama Zuma was trying to push him to take over at transnet after Brian Molefe left when he managed to allow Guptas n salim Essa to still billions. Media done their job to close them down Hi Who is binod "Like ACE Drivers/gaurds employment contracts will be revised after this by those corrupt folks 
1:31:51,1:37:00, Whi is it Vogue ke last numba how is this going to get the truth..Batohi is a lame duck as well Seeing our dirty linen After these drivers/gaurds witness it will be naive to say there was no state capture and JZ May someone kindly give me a summary on what has been spoken. Exactly @ Sammy Tlhapi "@Pascal Mumba "security n driver with so much information 
1:37:45,1:39:41, "There’s less chances that these gaurds/drivers can lie @Abel Matshidiso thank you so much! it's getting lit 😨 ...you still there Brian? Hola. Whose vehicle is witness 2 referring to? No ways my brother they are honest poor people treated like dogs Sammy Tlhapi They are Mr Gama they can lie just like the officials makhosi you are lying like that robot 
1:39:41,1:42:01, Gama also!! But also how stupid was these CEOs to do thier dirty work in front of thier gaurds/drivers? I don’t understand I think there must come a time when we do not defend factions. Stealing deprives the poor of their right to a better life. These guys did steal the resuurces but the stealing still continues today Loyalty to the bosses guys -it does happen .Remember it is bread and butter to them Nothing happened to Vytjie and Agrizzi. In fact the Hotel Owner confirmed what Agrizzi said about Nomvula's birthday. Netwok of cheating this robot no.2 needs update or calibration cos tyming ya peta massive amounts of money these guys have witnessed over the yrs @Pascal Mumba and they hv been threatened Or maybe it for the purpose of when they are drunk 🤷🏻‍♂️ @Sammy Tlhapi it could be that they were paying them. There was some kind of incentive for them. 
1:42:51,1:44:25, Lawyer is confusing this "After this "And I dont think they volunteered to testify "But still Belinda "Are Giyani "Regardless Belinda @Johannes Venter Mentor retracted her statements... so as Agrizzi in some of the things he said. dont single out Nomvula story it is a betrayal to the those who died for freedom- many bones of the freedom fighters are still out there "@Sammy Tlhapi  
1:44:26,1:48:24, Yey wen Same here @Sammy Tlhapi I beliieve them i really hope these witnesses can still be protected and also be allowed to be questioned on these allegations. "And remember Belinda @Johannes you must have been watching another state capture commission lol "Will he say how he was rewarded for the work "Even if they retracted You guys are grappling with straw. "It’s gonna be very difficult for the likes of Gigaba 
1:48:33,1:51:48, yerr so this guy transported a bag full of cash moer As if they know that this day would come -they have clear evidence this thieves have sucked the country resources dry are the suitcases part of the transaction or he had to empty it and return it I think these did History at school- yhooo @Pius 194 even I don’t steal money or break the laws and I proudly christian who’s not captured by anything of this world if you are wrong I don’t buy you I tell you straight hahahahaha what a trusted security guy with so much money access 🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆🙆 "The lesson here that we must learn is don’t eat alone 
1:52:09,1:54:08, We need a cashless society. The notes do not leave a trail. ö Vinod Binod This is a bag full of bulls hit. He had a sight of bank notes in the bag . which crook will leave a bag full of money unlocked ? What happened? "These stories are too vivid and seem well authored Rasheed Ally hates facts and pretends to be a psychologist. they have their written statement... @Sifiso Zulu 
1:54:11,1:56:29, wow... Google maps is very helpful most of the time fellow south africans this robot is lying Rashid is family to Guptas I guessed Rasheed is Gupta-related. slow motion stuff.. pathetic!! "Rashid you are on point Rasheed that how criminal exchange money this days they use take away bags some stuff in in whiskey boxes for exchange It’s a Vougue and Range Rover Sports @sifiso zulu I also knew then.that this day was coming 
1:56:30,1:58:42, binod binod these guys are well trained in taking note of small details. they need to be aware of everything as body guards what more is SIU wanted to here? I remember Des Van Royeen also met Mr Bobat at Melrose Acre no person can lie in such chronology witness 1 provide evidental proof by means of logbook binod binod HEY 
1:58:42,1:59:33, binod binod "the Zondo commission investigators dnt play 50K binod @Sandra Bailey agree 100% but they must still be questioned on the things they are saying. we cant just accept them as gospel truth. This is not a cross examination . they are just going through the statements and evidence already on record. the investigators would have already checked and verified the info /CCTV footage etc. #CBIFORSSR the poor domestic worker was fired 
1:59:34,2:03:30, A million Rand 🤦🏽‍♂️ They will be questioned in COURT. No Free Money at ALL "50k Rand thank you @Johannes these allegations are made at the commission not courts. the time for courts will come after the commission finishes its work. No Free Lunch the onest lies with the implicated person to proof otherwise remember a body guard is like a fly on the wall Abel Matshidiso - who would have paid them off? Yes - the courts will have to come. And then Molefe's advocate will bite these witnesses if they lie 
2:03:47,2:05:06, Waste of our time man @Johannes Venter I suppose the same officials as a way of buying their silence :dothefive::dothefive: give witness 2 a bell's Yerr dammit these fat cats witness 2 just implicated himself in wrongdoing so his evidence must bare lot of credibility "This should like Pablo Escobars Netflix series 😂.. money Whose silenece?? the witnesses are not silent. "What does ""binod"" mean??" 
2:05:19,2:07:11, fk knows :dothefive: :dothefive::dothefive: eish there are lots of Agrizzis in SA "😂😂😂😂😂...he knew its a dirty money "Take away the money evidence for a minute "He did not commit any crime it could have been clean money for all we know Salim Issa the mistermind of looters at transnet 
2:07:21,2:11:49, @Gugulethu He has enough evidence @gugulethu dube yes you very right there hi where is Salim essa "DJC must summons Issa to testify is it unfair to make the documents open to the public? 😂😂😂😂mmoney to receive a stamp on your passport have a price You would have been fired 
2:12:26,2:13:55, @Sammy. Even the movements were open okay at least he stole some money "Sammy Thlapi probably these drivers were pinching some stacks "I don’t think so Bophelo These drivers were planted by WMC Come Sifiso Never undermine thieves they know their money :dothefive::dothefive: Come on Sifiso 
2:14:12,2:17:56, @Sifiso Zulu that’s all you have. Lol. @Sifiso Zulu probably the commission came to them with evidence from transnet vehicle records "@Sammy Tlhapi do you remember how Cyril Ramaphosa ascended to ANC "Where is Norma Gigaba "Even if the bodyguards have been paid off "@gugulethu Sfiso Zulu when is this thing of shifting the blame to WMC going to end? Can we at least shoulder some blame for failing to govern without playing the race card? "@Johannes Venter you are very right there @gugulethu dube she won't say anything cause she had designer bags n shoes that were bought by dirty money kkkk 
2:18:07,2:21:53, #Luthando Xhamlayo mentioning WMC is not a race card baba """WMC"" does not exist. ANC-Monopoly Capital exists. The ANC is the only that controls monopoly businesses via government and that at tax payers' costs" if this looting dit not take place whe could have use the money to investigate wmc I could have opened that box 📦 and close it again like before "Sfiso Zulu they usually go for dummies. how did they employ such an intelligent driver? NHI taxi driver They ANC controls ALL the monopoly businesses in this country and steal them empty @Luthando Xhamlayo I agree with you fully. 
2:22:15,2:26:54, Benediction remember these were CEOs of big SOEs They are stealing from you and laughing very loudly Almost every SOE is a monopoly or oligopoly. and the 140m that was paid to the Eskom current CEO? A loan from zoomer "No its not corruption but irregularities because in this case the CEO is a white man let's not look at the issue along racail lines looting effect the poor along all races "I am not from SA Is it?? Again that is under control of the ANC. But I know that De Ruyter works for a much lower salary that he could have earned elsewhere and that he was the 40th candidate to be approached. 
2:27:26,2:34:31, Kamara looting of state funds Sifiso Zulu you’re irrelevant can you rather comment on the evidence this guy is giving Also that he struggles because Eskom is corrupt at every level. @Sammy Tlhapi I hope one day life could afford us an opportunity to discuss the looting of SOEs. The brown envelope culture But that’s what we doing now and you talking about WMC and Ramaphosa 🤷🏻‍♂️ Witchcraft??? Huh?? "that could have been off track Let’s hear what witness number 3 will say 
2:35:35,2:40:26, @KAMARA DANSOXO Llarge scale looting by state officials during the Zuma administration with the help of mainly the Gupta family who dictated appointments in parliament and state entities. "@Stronger together the economy was handed to ANC destroyed . They did just volunteer to end aparthied smoke break 😂 live audio testing They did not eish... ADJOURNMENT we hear him loud and clear I find the two witnesses very brave - without them endangering their loves we are nowhere. I do hope they are protected. they have a deal.......................where there's smoke....... 
2:41:49,2:47:33, Just question... Did our government allow Fracking to take part on our lands... Think its one of their underhanded dealings with the Americans just like the nuclear heads story??? but surely if they describe the the events those implicated will know who they are Read Revelation 18 "Seek ye the LORD @Roy Kisten . Definitely poor arrangement on the part of the Commision. The voice is not muffled at all. :dothefive::dothefive: An attorney in Potch is fighting the fracking - do not know who is involved? How have no arrests been made?! When last did the NPA investigate-to-an-arrest?! Gigaba here we go 
2:47:50,2:55:21, "how  I also thought so Gugulethu "So i take it its okay to gain money but not notify the public??? anyway my interests lie with FRACKING @Johannes Venter... Any links my kind sir??? People think i'm talking crazy!!! No I have not. It was an interim remark in a wider conversation. Try contact Hans-Jurie Moolman attorneys in Potch. "what is ""fracking""???" Another witness a leather brown bag. how many Julies are there in 2013? 
2:55:42,3:01:00, zuma says 11ty 3 @Stronger together...
