Mr Mbalula’s team needs 30 minutes for them to go through the paperwork presented to them. Hmm Mbalula seems agitated...wonder why #StateCaptureInquiry Counsel for Mbalula stands and introduces himself. He reiterates a request for a half hour adjournment for consultations before Mbalula begins with his evidence.

50:06,52:34, He isn't looking like the energetic Mbalula we know yes course the anc rule alone power to you Mr Mbalula He said that Zuma helped the DA grow The body language when you're about to lie knowing that you later will be exposed.

No...he didn't...@Bridgette...revisit the YT video @Diwi The Doer VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL 
1:20:27,1:22:04, 80% of all the ministers in this country are incompinant all of them runs this country like toilet paper im sorry i HAVE NO CONFIDENCE in our minters This would never link to Zuma because he'd say he doesn't know anything about and as it stands there is no proof that it has anything to do with him. Trevor Manuel told exactly what happened I the meeting and Mbablula even tweeted to thank him Okusalayo it was Gupta who told you about appointment So Trevor Manuel never lied but confuse names? "@Eslon Eslon yes April @Eslon Eslon Correct @goolamv let us rebuild the TRANSVAAL

Hmmm Hehhh..lol Yeye Julius Malema hv said this long ago in parliament law kicks in now we all will go for eff @goolamv Wasn't Nathi Mthethwa the Minister of Police back then? 
1:24:52,1:25:52, versions are not the same with Gupta He said the Gupta congratulated him!!! Media wouldn’t know anything about the skelm chat within the cabal. "Fils is a common TROLL  @Fils de I'homme I'm sorry I'm going to vote EFF❤ siyabonga perhaps your right let got it from horses mouth Now he blames the media...typical ANC tactic "@COLLEN COLLEN yes it is ok all as clear as mud 
1:26:05,1:27:09, He's now spinning @Unathi Sulani VOTE for the INDEPENDANCE OF THE TRANSVAAL Compound #Talloolah Moon MSM lie continually 👿 His a bit of a wild card The friend he was with is the CIC Julius Malema Ouch...The New Age!! that rag that stole taxpayers money Who is this Ombootsman?😂😂😂 @Fils de I'hemme yes... I believe EFF is capable of doing that 
1:27:22,1:29:08, Totally spinning like a top @Dave Ramorulane u r a silly BANTU Yup...moira we all misunderstood you "@COLLEN COLLEN the BANTUs cant build a country Thank you Chairman...I heard it too..Yirre this guy can lie When you lie you make so many hiccups on one statement... 🤔 @Fils de l'homme we must work together or there is no chance mbalula said on the phone he didn't say congratulations ...now he said congradulations 
1:29:10,1:30:29, Plz move the water bottle away Mbaks just hold on chairperson rather than CJ "@BanditZA I agree @Fils de I'hemme no thank you. this is South Africa not Transvaal @Mohapi😂😂😂 Eslon! He gonna knock it 🤣🤣🤣🤣 "Mbaks says he said heeee Raising his voice @COLLEN COLLEN let us rebuild the TRANSAVAAL

The caucausians built South AFrica the glasses goes with the new hairstyle Butterfly glasses are not for Mbalula @Talloolah Moon what do u mean? 
1:34:04,1:35:02, I say..Hayii...anthen.no small nyana smile mr mbaks... Half of the old NEC are still there Fils you’re playing a silly game Exactly Magda "Glasses r not a problem How did the Gupta have this guys phone number? there is no need for ANC minuets for that particular meeting unless there is someone whom is against what Mbalula is saying. @siyanda sibiya BANTUS cant focus whatever Siyanda.Sit down 
1:35:28,1:36:40, Epnet it’s obvious @siyanda sibiya exactly @siyanda sibiya I agree with you Siyanda you are quite correct "@streaming Siyanda is this your channel. You sit down "@siyanda sibiya it seems like you are easily distracted...best thing you could do is ""Hide Chat"". Thina simamele @Epnet I think the Chaiman picked it up already...that is why he is explaining now NEC must be dissolved! We all know that! 
1:36:42,1:38:27, The judge in a way is helping the evidence leader by asking these relevant questions to get clearity from Mbalula. this madala is an astute judge. listen to the question Mr. Mbalula is carefull with his words today. the ANC knew everything @Peter I have enormous respect for Judge Zondo "The NEC of the ruling party is useless Name plz Mr. Mbalula Manuel was there...lol #peter pott 👊🏻 I’m sure his a fantastic grandpa too 👌🏻👍🏻 I really have utmost respect for him. 
1:38:35,1:39:35, Speak up ANC NEC member Mbalula 😂 Why not? The Pres is a servant of the people there it is 😀 job security over the people of South Africa You can be reshuffled at NIGHT! 😂😂😂 Young 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 So problem started by Mandela even mr thuma mina was part of all this #NightTimeShuffle 
1:39:42,1:41:09, 😀😀😀😀😂😂😂 "Political salaries are too big to lose it seems...bodyguards...houses Haybo Mbaaks you young @ayanda hlongwane Ramaphosa was in business @siyanda sibiya i still see nothing wrong to what you said. Kgalema was the deputy president But the meeting ended and Zuma said absolutely NOTHING...didn't even react! #sipho Mandela was the orchestrator from within his cell 👹 ANC defends n protects itself 
1:41:36,1:42:34, Mbambula is contradicting himself. He just said one NEC member rose and rubbished him. Tell us who rubbished what you said. The President was there......Preach Mr Mbaks @Magda Seguin I don't think the president was at the nec meeting The only guilty person is that one member who rubbished Mbalula's statement Bridgette - Correct! The skelms look after each other OR their pockets feel it! I who was this NEC Member? How is he contradicting himself? m 
1:42:35,1:43:45, Stomach politics "So today Trevor Who is that comrade? Malema was in that meeting He was....didn't you hear Manuels testimony but there is no contradiction here This commission will never come to anything for the people of South Africa because there is no transparency in politics But he's contradicting himself at one point he said no one confronted him Julius Malema also kept quiet 
1:43:53,1:45:06, @peter pott u know that Bantus are cowards Zuma was there and nobody questioned him...revisit the YT video of Manuals testimony...it is online There is no contradiction I suspect Nathi Mthethwa rubbished what he said. yes zuma was there The commission is asking the party to be transparent @Magda Seguin I will do so Guys plz pay attention he said no one questioned "If any of them disagreed 
1:45:19,1:46:35, @Vusi Mbambiso lol Julius raised it long after he left the anc Exactly moira It had to be one of the staunches supporters of the president. Julius was already in trouble with the anc leadership at that time Mzalwane. "@fils the issue was not discussed instead he was rubbished by a certain NEC member. there is no contradiction here Mbalula trying to distance himself from the Guptas He knew exactly what was happening with the Guptas and Zuma...contradicting himself again 
1:46:46,1:47:40, @K-bee Mablack Moalosi Please be truthful. That was in the first 5 years of Zuma and Malema was the lead protector. When he insulted Khwezi. He coud have been the one insulting Mbalula. "@:Mzalwane that's why Jay-Z is so strong he have all the protection he needed after all he's not the only thief but the whole ANC are they wanted to sade their jobs Julius kept quite in the NEC meeting when this was raised by Fikile. #peter pott - you are simply intending to be racist! You are talking unadulterated crap! Yet the ANC still carried on with the Guptas fikile mbalula must tell the truth man Exactly!! @peter pott. Today they'd go around saying they didn't support Apartheid when it made them and still defending what they benefited from Apartheid and by Apartheid. 
1:47:54,1:49:13, @Ngema N.E The president and secretary of the youth/ women and veterans league sit in the NEC Latest News: Sangoma translated Ramaphosa's train stuck as the end sign of the ANC's ruling 2019. He added that if President had dreams about Train stuck that means funeral 'must watch' he said "Juju was correct to raise it at the rally @goolamv...I ask myself the same question...He is trying to spin his involvement Who is that person? Nowonder isn’t Bathabile Dlamini? He started well until he contradict himself Gogo glasses. Is he gay? Julius Malema only publicised it as a tool when he was out of the ANC. "@Mzalwane Mzala Thanks 
1:49:21,1:50:48, Juju is pure EVIL! Klaar! is he not in brett kebbles book i was thinking that who is that person mara? Mzalwane you are misinformed. This issue happened here in Mangaung during the elective conference that kicked Kgalema Motlanthe out and Cyril became dp. Malema was already in conflict with Zuma. It could be someone who said he would die for president Zuma. Malem "My man💪🏼 Yes @John Fagan..He was ANCYL leader and received money from Kebble @K-bee Mablack Moalosi This was in a NEC meeting 
1:51:04,1:52:15, This guy is so tainted. It's well known that he's in Johann Rupert's pockets He was already subjected to the D.C. Barry Sargent wrote the book...I still have it in my library "Juju told branches at Jan 8 rally in Rustenburg Brett Kebble was...Gay i am Right That has been alluded to but not proven this whole thing started by EFF hmmmmm Mbalula is leaning 
1:52:16,1:53:57, "@Unathi Sulani halalala nxamalala😀😀 "This man had better watch his back @K-bee Mablack Moalosi VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL You are correct Mzalwane. The EC meeting that they held in Mangaung just before the conference. EFF should be applaud for revealing secrets. If it wasnt for eff we wouldnt know any wrong doings of MPs This happened way before Mangaung and Mbalula subsequently stood for elections against Zuma and Mantashe slate at Mangaung Eff is using this platform for electioneering Only because he had the platform Petrus 
1:54:05,1:55:32, NOT the EFF...Thuli Madonsela...the EFF had it in for Zuma and used her report "@Mzalwane Mzala get your facts ryt This seating was always going to be a hot potato that the DCJ is virtually taking over...... The Commission Chair could not hold himself. He must give Ms Gacabshe a chance to lead the evidence! @Sipho You are not disputing that Malema kept quiet in that meeting Hundreds of people were interviewed by Thuli after confidential complaints by citizens.. "'Snitch"" 😂😁" 😀😀😀😀tell them. television hero's. pravin was there too. never spoke up in the meetings "Mbalula 
1:55:36,1:57:13, Ace Magashule is next...believe me The language of NEC not being a sheeben sounds like a youger person Supra Mahumapelo rubbished what he said! The entire ANC was captured...they voted 9 times to keep Zuma "Thando He’s nervous 😀 😀 😀 @goolamv​ Why is the water shaking so much suddenly table is shaking 😂 @Vusi Mbambiso I can not rule out Supra 
1:57:27,1:59:37, #goolamv. 🤣 He’s Trying to add bubbles and call it “Sparkling Water” 😝 The chap is shaking. He has to leave the room It is true the whole ANC NEC was captured. How can they ignore what Mbalula said! NEC must be DISSOLVED DCJ is really enjoying this conversation with Mbaks Eskom had ten CEO's in nine years... @goolamv HE is entitled to do so for more clearity ☯️ ✅ ☯️ ✅ 
1:59:49,2:00:23, ☯️ ✅ "mr fear ""nothing""" Eskimo ☯️ ✅ Stop lies. Mbalula became a Minister of Sport in 2010. That is two years before Mangaung. I am sure Ramaphosa was there and he kept quite The Chair has suddenly retired the evidence leader🤔. This commission is an act🤔🤔🤔 It has motives Eskom should nationalise 
2:00:29,2:01:00, ANC MPs defended Zuma live on TV in parliament against EFF. Now ANC say Vote ANC to grow South Africa together (lier) To help them to be more billionaires while you're in dirk {Facebook} Zuma is a boss indeed😀😀80 people scared of him "Sounds more like a waterfall in the background So resigning and blowing the whistle was not an option? ✅☯️ 2010 is it just me or Mbalula looks scared? i mean his face shows that he is scared "Sounds more like a waterfall in the background Zuma is Boss 
2:01:00,2:02:50, so mbaks is a zuma rival from today ✅☯️ "Moira T "The water bottle needs Jesus @Desmond Maripane In 2012 already he challenged the Zuma slate and stood with Kgalema in Mangaung. Desmond you’re on it from being Zuma's scape-goat to being Zuma's rival 🤣🤣🤣 The banks acted autonomously...The government has no say in closing bank accounts.He made a mistake there as they were probably discussing after the banks closed the Gupta accounts my guess it can be one of the following magoons: 1 Ace Magashule 2 Supra 3 Sikhile Zikalala 4 Collin Maine 
2:03:06,2:04:55, "Mbaks is shaking and he's covering that by moving his hands He raised this matter in August 2011. can Zondo allow this beautiful advocate to ask questions The lady in a white top....yerrrrrrrrr he is also a cowards😀😀 Zondo did not allow the flow @Eslon Eslon Add Julius Malema to that list one thing is clear never date a lawyer🤣 He took a very long time to raise this issue and still cried like a baby! 
2:05:15,2:06:34, i will only vote for the ANC just because in my view there is no credible opposition. sad state of affairs @goolamv His evidence is that they fell out after he raised this in the NEC and we now know that was in August 2011. Where is the lie? Raising an issue from perceptions at that time cannot be seen as ignorance or being scared from the NEC members without facts. "you wait for nearly a year "@Mzalwane Mbaks is just showing that THE President is all powerful in the NEC His testimony is full of holes and not convincing "He must be honest Vote EFF 
2:06:45,2:07:57, He is protecting himself. First and foremost lol ANC PMs were busy dancing Michael Jackson's song in parliament title: smooth criminal [twitter] the chair doesnt allow the advocate to interrogate He must have been under pressure to award the Guptas some sport contract! 🤦🏼‍♀️ here comes a bs story 🤦🏼‍♀️ @Sipho Do you now get that this was raised in August 2011? The advocate is being sidelined. Let her do her job please you boiled for 11months? yeah neh. stomach politics 
2:08:31,2:09:46, Adr24. Yes Too many lies. Too many years now we want to hear about the cricket event zondo must keep quiet pls "Zondo is too excited today "can someone please reminds Mbalula that he is under oath and he should tell the truth He makes himself out to be a hero It seems like Zondo himself is captured i somehow think zondo is talking too much...its about time he keep quiet so that questions can be asked 
2:09:47,2:11:26, mbaks is canvassing support mbalula wanted to say something about cricket event in durban. "I am boiling for 30 years whats wrong there's this woman in white top and black what what 😭😭😭😭 "He raised it in 2011 but it happened in 2010 "He raises eyebrows on how he handles witnesses differently to fish for more into the stories. He didn't do this on Mzwanele Manyi The Judge must know everything for his report and final recommendations @Allan Tshuma Zondo is talking too much today ... 
2:11:35,2:16:05, If he were hanging out with the Guptas he is hence Guilty of something! so he should have never ever spoken since he spoke late Maybe the Commission could have handle Mbaks' eveidence differently hence it's aka zondo commission. who says last word? zondo Justice Zondo is excited like a child in a sweet shop! @Mthokozisi Ndlovu ...........pity you have wasted many years......should've maybe moved to another country or studied something to improve yourself..Sis So everyone was comfortable gossiping outside but didn't have the balls to support you when you raise the issue at the meeting ..#BunchOfCowards @Tito 2000...spot on "I would like to hear about the Dubai meeting he attended where Joemat-Pettersen 
2:17:41,2:26:02, He is 47 Years Old.... "The Judge presides over this Commission says he was young...Nonsense The evidence leader felt excluded and hinted to that to the judge! I like this guy The Guptas like Cricket #Tito. 🎯 he ha I hope the evidence leader can ask some probing questions now without the Chair's interference! 
2:26:38,2:29:10, Trigger o Cricket adv😜? heeee iright bengifuna nihleke #Nxamalala What happened to the cute lady in white top😎 where is she? im still waiting for the smoking gun Talk my Lady! Who is the NEC member who rubbished him in that meeting??? "fikile is ab2 to loose it  @Solly it is either Supra or Ace! "stop labelling peope as ""cute lady"" these terms are sexist" so JZ cant be associated with the Gupts then it means Sililli must cut ties with the Motsepes 
2:29:22,2:30:40, I was rubbished in a meeting SABC Digital News please stop messing with the sound @Solly 12... He haven't name him yet protecting them Vusi Mbambiso maybe it was Nomvula He must name and shame. "We need names Mbalula "Mr Q "Solly 
2:30:42,2:32:14, can someone please tell Zondo to keep quiet He sound stupid who is somebody. Plz keep quite Mr. Chair The comrade was Julius Malema "He fears for cross examination that's why he doesn't wanna mention people's names "Caroline Hawanga SABC DIGITAL NEWS is not messing with sound sound is sucking #Thando Nkutha. 🤣 I suggest you take a chillax pill 😀 The Judge is distracting the evidence leader! I am starting to be suspicious! 
2:32:36,2:33:56, @SABC Digital News noted Zondo need to relax yazi Zondo’s line of questioning is perfect women are capable as advocate "Ok Alright thank you @SABC Digital News please whisper to sound team to fix sound mbalula answer the question....dont explain Zondo's questions are up to high standard 
2:34:11,2:36:45, who's everybody #Sipho ✅👌🏻 He never raised it anywhere again! He enjoyed his ministerial salary! Yes he must explain he must summerise his answers Vusi 🎯 he is protecting some people bcz his wife wz also involve in some tender Thando Nkutha who do you want to block😀 "In fact "The whole meeting became silent 
2:37:10,2:39:14, #Thando Nkutha 🤣 Count to 10 😉 Recall again @SABC Digital News Maybe ... Mbalula is lying on this question...look at hs face Where did Ajay get his cell number? SABC Digital News the sound quality is actually bad yooh...ja ne Mbalula u don't answer the questions Baba Mbaks he's lying 
2:39:19,2:40:08, Mbaks forgot if Ajay was calling for the first time or not....haaaaa something fishing here!!!!! so you have spoken before?

So people sell the country for CURRY!!! 
3:01:49,3:02:48, "Guptas wanted them to focus Gupta food gave them HUNGER for money and corruption "the curry didn't finish him A whole country captured over a plate of curry? So I guess Mokanye made chicken curry Is there a cabinet minister who served in the previous administration who didn't visit or called to visit Saxonworld shebeen? thats true clement now we have loadshading just for a plate of curry brian curry so that you can be 
3:02:54,3:06:06, ndaa! The Saxonwold shebeen and restaurant was popular among ANC cadres I'm only interested in knowing how did the got to know that Mbalula was going to be sports minister. evidence leader was enroute there just to be stopped by Zondo when Malema ask Mbalula did you visit Gupta he say no waaaaaaaaa wena Mbalula suka mnxn You mean South Africa captured for curry wow Gupta are most top scammers worl wide Mmmmmmm....the really seems to like and respect this fella tooo much Ooop..the Chair Something smells here! Irrelevant when or why he went there- he should never have been there for any reason whatsoever 
3:06:21,3:08:13, Mbalula's testimony strengthens the one of Mcebisi Jonas. Mbaks finished the curry Mutton or lamb curry.. mmmm. Choices are hard ey he needs to be sober maan This Saxonwold shebeen curry must have been the best on the continent( bewitching ne?) Razz Matazz curry He must stop being emotional! "I'm not happy with Zondo "He is anc Agrizzi 
3:08:17,3:09:32, "Really getting tired of the ANC's lies about ""Not knowing"" what was happening and yet they're sitting having curry in the Guptas home.." BP mbalula is a lier. he was put on that possition by guptas.they even offered him a plate of curry .to make matters worse when malema asked him in the parliament if he visited the guptas house he denied vagitable curry....it was nice nehhhh Speculation and obfuscating...getting himself deeper in trouble even going sovfar as to find ing excuses for the NEC! 'benefit of the doubt'..Eish so mbaks wasn't a fan of Zuma? I'm trying to understand his position on Zuma. "After the discredidting of Vytjie's testimony 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 - Zondo touching Mbalula in his spot.He is getting emotional yerrrrr Kill the cut Razz matazz don’t be scared 😱 
3:09:39,3:11:47, ANC voters they are ready to rescue Gupta's soon they hate EFF they know they'll pay back all these No curry No Power ANC voters are sobber so all the MP's who visited the Gupta household ate the curry and decided to sell the country...just for a plate of curry Extremely smart of DCJ Only if the Zondo could allow evidence leader space and time to flow or maybe by eating curry he means rating millions he was offered that is rubish The Judge must clarify...he is right in asking probing questions 
3:12:05,3:14:11, must have put Muthi in the curry mbalula looks like a gangster I think Mbalula needed curry before coming to this enquiry 🙄🙄🙄 Curry is a problematic to ministers and politicians Vitjie Mentoor Said mbalula visited the gupta household and she was fired That curry must be so nice That's why he's on the ANC...NEC @Petrus Kitsiso Notice Rabotlhale Vytjie never said that Zuma must hace told the Guptas what happebed in the NEC meeting 
3:14:13,3:16:07, zonya mbalula Mr Curry tell us more boy. when we look at Gwede he looks like he ate a lot of curry at Saxon world Benjamin uzonyaa why? Zuma went to the Guptas after every NEC meeting Manuel was being crazy on the one of qualities to be a sport minister. R63M on Zuma's case[EFF] Ramaphosa replied Zuma will pay back if not Government knows where to recover its money. [Expert] fuel & products will be increased to recover Zuma's legal cost. You're ready? The wonderful curry had a sprinkling of Corruption powder...... @Mzalwane Mzala why was vytjie fired if i may ask 
3:16:29,3:19:38, "The Guptas launched a scathing campaign against Mbalula and couldn't get him fired Repeating the same thing over and over again. @Petrus Kitsiso Notice Rabotlhale It had nothing to do with Mbalula. Vytjie says she refused an offer of being made a minister to discontinue SAA' India line Mbalula wanya Tsotsi kwaaaaaa Oksalayo so Votela EFF @Mzalwane Mzala noted sir EFF PHAMBILI @Mzalwane Mzala but it also had to do with the guptas right? and some MP'S involved right? "He forgets that he is under oath 
3:19:39,3:20:42, vote EFF Yes So he lied to the Public Protector Mbalula always praise Eff on Twitter he lied phantsi ngamasela kubi Lol he is scared lol 
3:20:45,3:21:55, Caught and the Judge Zondo jumps in Chairman is coming to Mbaks rescue now 🙈🙈🙈 Every man for himself It is either lied to the Public Protector or he is lying here! Zondo will defend him After Zuma's resign tax increased from 14% to 15% government knows where to recover its money [Ramaphosa] because you voted Zuma & ANC voters are the responsible for his mistakes. "He's caught pants down University of Limpopo EFFSC is here I said before that I don't trust him...He cannot try now to cover up lying 
3:22:26,3:23:29, Now the crap comes out... even Ramaphosa...No change will he made Let me repeat: when you tell the truth you never have to remember lies Ramaphosa is making changes lies lies lies Y’all are not working?😹 it's scrapping and spinning time they should all hang there heads in shame they can't even remember that it's a lie but its said openly Jonas Lied to public protector now Mbalula 
3:23:29,3:24:26, Mbalula lying?? 2 different stories @Magda I agree with you He didn't answer that question Mbaks This is a most complicated session I have seen in this commission. It’s all bcoz there is lie hovering above it Mbaks is scared 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 he was there ppl stealing money Boom "Fact remains you hear b4 you called by President broke the news sir to you 
3:24:32,3:25:41, @Michael Gumede...hostile witness Please Chair don't spoon feed him... He's cracking It is possible that Mbalula was still protecting his benefactor when he went before the Public Protector Ek fear F&&all is starting to look very uncomfortable??? Mbaks is in hot water !!! @Mzalwane Mzala he must say it It's not easy to recall the lies you told after a very long time.... Do not protect him Chair.. 
3:25:48,3:27:26, He was covering up for Zuma in his interview with the PP....never thought he will have to answer one day Trying to protect the former president will haunt many people who are trying to clear themselves now. ku shushu @Wiseman Magosa thats true People like Jonas stuck to their story both before the Public Protector and this commission. He should just own up like other witnesses did...He has no integrity contradiction contradictions "Now he's lying now 
3:27:30,3:28:14, Huh Fikile?? Liaaaaarrrr!!!! He must just say he misunderstood the public protector. Mr Mbalula you are not giving correct answer Mzalwane Mzala that's because what they said was the truth.. @ Magda Seguin.... he also forgot that he is under oath. Future will challenge his lies. Appointed vs congratulated He thinks this is cosas conference. He's spinning things 
3:28:14,3:28:55, he is lying is it fair for me to call DCJ Bhodloza? @Michael Gumede...spot on The Judge is stunned by this witness!!! Contradictions cannot be covered. Facebook: ANC is like bad tyre you can't drive far until you change it Ramaphosa's government is already abused by former ANC & no arrest yet until you change it. Come on Razzmataz bathathe Jola😁😁😁 history will judge him vry harsh "They thought coming to the commission woulf be easy. Zuma will always walk them over 
3:28:57,3:29:58, Contradictions If you miss opportunity to clarify clouds will hangout soon to your head Hayini lo tata! He must not spin and just said I might have misunderstood. Otherwise he will be digging a hole for himself. Own up please hayi fikile maan Just admit you lied to the public protector! clever looks stupid now you are under oath Fikile 
3:30:00,3:31:35, Wait so... he doesn't need those glasses? kunzima ke lana manje 😓😂 what we are seeing here is a case of someone who tried to protect an incumbent president but is now active in the project of villifying him as a former. if only the DCJ Zondo would allow the Advocate. Mbalula looks like he's sweating now.... There is no testimony under oath when you meet the public protector. @thabang it's getting hot eish...zondo please give this lady a chance to fry mbaks with questions...please do not disturb her AJAY congratulated him not appointed or offered the position nd his explanation is derived from two different contexts Mbalula cracking now 😃😃😃 
3:31:42,3:32:56, A fudge is being done in front of our eyes..! Hahhahahah! I thought his explanation sets him free He's weak weak weak...!! @thabang. I thought i was the only one thinking that ...i'm sure it must be his wife's specs "@Mzalwane Mzala it absolutely is ""under oath"" when one testifies before the P.P" "Malema Julius must also come to the stand "Lies Yerrrr!!! 🤦🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️ well said.@carnoth ngomane 
3:33:01,3:33:37, can Former president come testify? He might just avoid this offered and congratulated two differnt terms so Mbaks is correct Mmmm....shifty eyes now.. lol Connect the dots Mbalula please is obviously you are appointed by Gupta Zuma maintains he did nothing wrong "Wow nothing shows that they have learnt something from the revolution .... what are they doing about it 
3:33:43,3:35:07, it is ironic It makes sense the contexts are different "ya neh lets stop having preconceptions about what mbaks must say "Zuma's lawyers will equalize on this this guy he's a liar any live audio streaming.... this chows my data yooook mbalula is trying to tell the truth but he lies are haunting him I am starting not to believe all his stories 
3:35:07,3:36:16, 😃 😃 HE cant recall. he is being double tongue here. what was his reaction then when the president finally inform him of his appointment? @em D Under oath is when you are before a court or a judicial enquiry/ commission. it should be a question and answer MR CHAIR He has already allowed water to get into his chamber and he's already wet. "like Jonas  I think that he will say that Floyd Mayweather offered him the job when he enjoyed the boxing fight?? Zuma sold the country to the Guptas nothing will change that fact 
3:36:40,3:37:37, @em D To be under oath you must take an oath like it happened in this commision or in a court of law yes zuma betrayed us 🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️ "Jonas "@ Mzalwane Mzala I put it to you that a statement to the P.P is a sworn statement. Technicalities aside 😀😀😀he also takes off his glasses now the plot thickens Mr Mbaks "Just admit that u lying to the public protector "DJC Zondo is just interrupting. please sir

3:40:36,3:41:25, Mbalula had a problem with Madonsela... gave her attitude... this is why he is conflicted now. flip flopping... "ku shubile 🙄🙄🙄 "zuma is a dead snake @thabang your sense of humour is very refreshing under these horrid circumstances...you should be a writer "PP "" I heard from the President" mbalulA is not helping this commission @Albert Noah you are correct Told b4 you have been told by President simply you have appointed by Guptas

3:44:15,3:45:15, "As I said b4 Mbalula is dropping the opportunity to put meaningful remarks here but failed to say he feels like he was appointed by Guptas besides the president Lying in a foreign language is a challenge wow frame of the mind hahahahahah Don't do that...you are trying to get in deeper Mr Mbablula is this anc head of elections? president cr is going to replace him before Month end They got him now Now he is lying here. Embarrassment again Fiks has peed his pants. What a shame "Imagination of NDZ triumphs @ Nasrec

3:51:28,3:52:00, Mbalula is showing signs of empty vessel syndrome. Mbaks for President..the rest attempted and failed to lie...Mbaks is a qualified lier💃🏿 Judge is trying to let him confess a d own that he lied for Zuma now he wants to smell like roses "@cerebs "I am never using the term ""Frame of Mind"" again. I am may be confused for liar tjo" he only wants to testify on what he said in the NEC meeting. Did not expect them to bring in PP report the judge needs to draw a stick man diagram here! the commision should invite Zuma or perhaps he will be last to testify 
3:52:12,3:53:20, He is a bunch of a liar. no credibility Hehehe....I agree peter @ Malose Leopeng I warned him in my sleep to lol ya ku bole kondlo la kaya la...kanunwa xoo @malose lol Kshubile Let’s check the oxford dictionary “ frame if mind” 😀😀😀😀 Iyabhubhudla inkezo

He will fall deeper into trouble! Why did he accept the minister position knowing very well the guptas already knew he was to be a minister? Haibo Judge...He was fully aware! He was protecting Zuma and the Guptas 
3:54:50,3:56:27, "@ Michael Gumede I think the word ""Frame"" in ""Frame of Mind"" now means propensity for the mind to produce an untruth lol" MbalulA must ask them to give him a break Can MbalulA protect himself from himself He's going in circles now "@Big vinny its 1 oclock now Eeeesh....now all the excuses... The PP asked straightforward questions...now he is blaming her questioning...down the abyss we go... That’s true this guy will hurt himself shame "i don't think he ate vagitable curry only while others promised millions. 
3:56:40,3:57:59, we ms you our madonsela @Philani Madlala that's what I would also like to know. He should've refused and said this position is already tainted. People who do not recognise their shortcomings and faults are narcissistic I am sure mbalula did not eat that curry. He orderd a 🍕🤣🤣🤣 but Philani Madlala we have also had instances where media will know some information before its officially announced and how does that differ from that which was known by the guptas "Very rarely Mbalula The only way he is now going to get out of this is to fake a heart attack! I am amper starting to feel sorry for this guy.....But I cannot judge Zondo is great i didn't know that mbalula is stupid 
3:58:07,3:59:46, can MbalulA protect himself from his lies The Guptas captured Mbalula and the media got the scoop even before he was captured @Sabelo Dlamini are you in denial of state capture?

He must specify that it was the NEW AGE...a government sponsored rag That Hairstyle and sunglasses are the reason You Are Lying to the State Wena Mkhulu "Mbalula is tired now I think he will be safer with a No Comment answer?? always did 
4:16:47,4:18:43, Mbalula please don’t tweet again tjoo always a ban 10 I agree. he lost respect today.. This judge is in love with Mafuta watching from The Bahamas Iphisi nezinyoka.... "Watching from Southampton His not lying we just want him to tell us what we want to hear .. Gullible South Africans ... "I'm watching from datkest africa 
4:18:46,4:20:27, "let me help mr Mbalula "I hope South Africans vote for The EFF PARTY. it will help Blacks not only in South Africa Judge...He was protecting Zuma.He told the PP he is only accountable to the ANC why does Sandton not have loadshedding? Business district? important place frame of mind😀 one question again and again Alright tell us about R300 000 trip why was paid to by different banks please no more vocal people please make sense to the nation 
4:20:46,4:22:07, because is sandton mr le roux Zibhajwa kweziwudlayo... Zondo is smart he want Mbaks to conceit to his lies "The ANC had no respect for the PP  he's being given a chance to hang himself here Adv Thuli Madonsela is an icon of respect and integrity NXA YES YES YES YES WHAT YES "Chair Raz Mataaz cant get his story right.....problem when you lie 
4:22:09,4:23:50, Mbalula is full of himself. He is totally failing the ANC movement. Accused???...mind the words Mr Mbablula "baleka warra warra warrra BP Ms Gcabashe is really roasting Mbalula mbalula a liar Chair Lunch "Like the advocate

4:24:41,4:26:52, Indeed Makhosi he is causing his two counsel's to have running stomach. look how uneasy they are in the background☺☺ we on the same apge Mbalula a Gupta minister Mabaks will never ever eat a Curry meal again? He is doing more damage to the ANC at large. ☺☺☺☺☺ @Michael Gumede true This man cannot remain the head of the ANC election team....surely not?? 
4:27:13,4:29:47, @whitepope5 You follow Jordan peterson..Lol So why was the commission established? To probe previous matters or to allow those implicated to come clean? No individual responsibility is accepted. Socialists don't believe in it. Their excuse is collective responsibility i.e. individuals get off scot free no matter what they do. this day is not turning out the way mbalula thought "eish Direct quotation "Fikile ""Mr Curry"" Mbalula" "Direct questions from Gcabashe😀 "ok 
4:29:57,4:32:15, Amen 🙈 who is he "I think where Mbaks went wrong was in not asking Ajay questions when he congratulated him. He shouldn't have just said ""hee"" and dropped the phone. He should've asked how Ajay knew" who's this guy? 🙈 mbalula counsel @Thando Nkutha 😂😂 Baldy its rough! He even has to take off his glasses 😂 😂 😂 😂 
4:32:32,4:33:02, taking off his glasses he is trying to save the day @gyburiel 😁😁😁😁😁 This guys looks like me. Who is he? I need to find out from my father!! 😂 😂 😂 He took off those funny glasses🤯🤣😂 "His ""STATE OF MIND"" was simply put ""CAPTURED"" by political expediency. Uyanya uFiks" focus is gone Mbalula counsel asked his employer I assumed he will give wrong answer again 
4:33:10,4:35:22, ill prepared with his client Hang on there mr Mbalula fence is it just me or Fikile looks like loyiso Gola today ngathi sekukhona nabafuna ukduma ngoMbalula nje lana what subject did you raise? i was meaning or i mearnt? lol @whitepope we don't need philosophy lectures 
4:35:42,4:36:22, this fellows are ill prepared. haikhona 😭💔 Just tell him what you want man....He is totally off balance now! he doesn't listen to question he just answer lool ziyambuyela u Razmatas🤣 This guy is doing damage control for himself. He is trying so much to cover his ars here. "He said he was not always there at the NEC meetings mbalula is going to fire his counsel after this "@whitepope5 I can't find a worse socialist than christ himself. Somehow 'Christianity' is anti socialism 
4:36:30,4:37:51, "now I can say  "Kahle bo  hehehehe So he calls his fellow NEC comrades cowards😀😀 Mr Mbalula must learn to come straight to the point in answering questions. "I see Mbalula coming back again to commission to clarify this mess this guy was supposed to be a state counsel instead because his questioning is roasting mbalula again mbalulas head is like Ndlozis head EFF Counsel please send sms what answer you want please now is cracked more and more 
4:38:12,4:40:45, Yet you consisted with the Guptas...and supported Zuma. Your comrades so not be happy that you call them cowards knives are out at luthuli house awaiting for mbalula. they must stop now today sonele ngamaga mbalulas head vs Ndloziz head "@whitepope stop preaching we are all educated lying IS a state of mind "Maybe Mbalula is quitting politics after this Even himself he was a coward cause he denied he had a conversation with Ajay b4 his appointment to public protector Goodnes! even his lawyer is confused not to realize he's inflicting more harm on him with his questions 
4:41:22,4:42:53, damage control @Eslon Eslon thats why i said his counsel is going to be fire today "A whole room of lawyers say that there is conflict ( even his own council) lol "@Elson This is like slow Chinese torture now counsel is trying to make mbaks to look like a hero during NEC meetings.. This is the first time that lunch will be late "I think he supposed to read evidence b4 him two weeks before he came here not wat he knew which contradicts himself This is what happens when you cant remember your lies. Idiot 
4:43:00,4:45:00, Blocked whitepope Me too Magda....is he selling books?? post facto Change your stance Mbalula please what you give us is exactly true that Guptas appoints you b4 president This lawyer is not helping Mbalula at all but dragg him into trouble witpope5 stop irritating "They were supposed to stop at 13h30 he is from Dubai @Cerebis selling philosophical theories on power 
4:45:46,4:47:53, Irritating to say the least Magda wher did he (Ajay Gupta ) got your number I think he is the last witness after him is msholozi Very irritating @Cerebis...He is on the wrong forum.At least he is not rude or obnoxious This guy was minister of police after sport and did nothing about state capture. Agree Magda "Rajah is not for every one April @Thando Nkutha 🤔 
4:48:29,4:51:11, he cant be the last witness cos Zuma must close the gate zuma zuma zuma to come you can not eat curry and remain loyalty "look @kokomm he is now defending himself on the wrong platforms instead of cmng here The poor guy is sweating bullets "Zondo is promising  "@Thando Nkutha Throwing Zuma and his comrades under the bus extract the Truth from the facts - Chinese 
4:51:15,4:52:09, If you came clean we would have respected what you are saying right now but it's too late...sorry Mbalula is a mafia mortgaging of State Power! "Wow Did he made mathematical and science? Mbaluli is clear in discussions. "Thanks for saying nothing but lies He is now lecturing deputy chair "some of the witnesses we've listen to  
4:52:18,4:53:23, how can this chameleon give advice for the future Added to my previous comment - All ANC MPs ignored their oath. power corrupts absolutely "So why is he shouting ? he was asked questions he mumbled. Eskom...The Rogue Unit never existed...the Sunday Times was implicated and taken for a ride by Moyane.They even lost an award which was rescinded this week.Stop talking about a fictitious 'rogue unit' Sellout what is that snoring sound. its so irritating 
4:53:29,4:54:48, My cader Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm mmm The Judge is saying errr a lot @sifiso😀😀live my grandpa alone The ANC is at trial here. @Cerebis its a strategy to get more infor "power corrupts @whitepope5 You may be very interested in what you are saying but this is not the right place to give a philosophical lecture. Zondo cheated on this one 
4:55:10,4:57:09, Jip....giving him rope Zolani??? this is not a trial Tando....please leave the race thing out of this? c'mon guys this not about black or white @Thando Nkutha ....deary....you need us ...big time "My brother is a slow killer. He give you all the freedom to talk but on the cross examination you will die slowly. Mbaks is sweating shame "Fikile likes long empty sentences @Thando Nkutha I'm a South African. If you think skin colour has anything to do with this I have to disagree. he wanted to sound clever on things he didn't know
