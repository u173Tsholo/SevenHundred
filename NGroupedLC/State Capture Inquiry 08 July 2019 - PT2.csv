"@LYD online tv I am not sure brother. I joined just now "Anne M yes he did It is important you make up your mind😁😁😁code for you are lying "Lex Luger true 
17:17,20:48, "@Solly 12 I agree Proves all previous reports are unreliable. Get the one the previous PP did. Cut all the crap. who wrote this Beholden to Zuma for giving him an ambassador job They all cover up for number one yey this guy🙄 what happened to the Secretary of the commission Dtr Khotso de Wee? Lex Luger I understand the sarcasm but there’s Other Justices in the concourt "Shame 
22:17,23:17, State Capture is just a misunderstanding... He knows he is in deep...dont remember...eish Did the PA also get a promotion after this? this man lies so bad this Mdala remembers all except the most important parts "He sounds like Col Oliver North of the Iran Contra hearings. Standard reply was Mabena I DO NOT RECALL His testimony will be shredded to pieces in a court of law 
23:18,25:15, Does he remember that he is a South African??? He is like Jimmy Manyi 😃 "the chair has long seen these is a liar be corrupt ....and you get a nice job as ambassador..... wonderful..... I hope they busy finding a new person for his current task outside SA. "Pity the majority of ANC voters dont have access to these lies @Elton Cowin not where the Guptas issue is concerned. It made news immediately & therefore becomes difficult to forget. "Chair to the witness: ""Can you tell us your name"" Him: ""I don't recall chair""" 
25:36,27:03, @Elton Cowan why do the other witnesses remember? It's their work for goodness sake! @goolamv lol imagine he is in a meeting with world leaders and he forgot the date of 1994 all on the above "@Elton cowin we know that this makes our country standstills they know that this would hunt them with their decision to allow aircraft without following protocol 6 years engraved on his brain with notes and grooming from lawyers. Plus you must remember why you got big pay rise and now job. Very poor memory amnesia "He thinks saying ""I do not recall"" exonerates one." 
27:04,28:48, smart questioning by the evidence leader smart lady Agreed Magda but then he has moments of absolute clarity. Amazing I can’t recall is another way of saying ... I don’t agree selective amnesia @Yose Human Zuma is just gonna take them even in bigger circles So Aggrizzi is the only one to hold his hand up & say I did wrong things i should not have done Zuma meandos 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @x. .x Don't be so angry friend. IT IS ALL in the past 
29:07,30:05, "all corrupt witness is mandated by their lawyers to just respond if in corner with: ""I don't recall""" @Kevin Allister Simon he's gonna respond in Meandos lol @Yose Human you've never met a psychopath The poor PA. hope she has very bug gum boots because the shyte is getting deeper. @Yose Human kwaaaaa!! Excuse again about time comrade koloane😀😀😀😀 this guy is a crook😂 i dont recall 
30:17,32:58, his memory has become very poor 🤣🤣 Memory not poor ....its BAD..which court will believe this hogwash? "when you guilty. just raise your tone "take a bullet for JZ Excuses you will see this face again next year JZ is the best employer in south Africa. "Deny Who was minister of defence at the time 
34:08,35:51, @Yose Human I think you are a bit out of it. A flight doesn't just get diverted. A flight scheduler was here last week and painted a picture of how much work it takes "@maloney recall him ASP The guy talking was born to be a lawyer. & she’s still a minister of defence The Thalys (bullet train) takes less than two hours to Amsterdam from where I am "Smooth That attitude is guilty Lawyers not seeing how serious this is 
36:00,37:05, What's that lawyer's name? What a stud mmm so handsome "😀😀😀let's count now how many times he will use the words ""I don't recall""" "A stud is not necessarily intelligent This witness is nonsensifying now @peter pott lets do it. lol great time to be a lawyers for witnesses appearing. billing is high and daily rate killing This fool messed up and still feels he is not even given a fare hearing This guy thinks he is above everyone else 
37:12,38:49, He is trying to run away from the fact This lad committed Treason!!!! judge Zonda is the best. He already said approved ntshisi must carry on a poor version of Manyi "me I said I have so much respect for the DCJ Oh Goody. there are tapes...😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 @Abel Matshidiso Your worship 
39:09,41:40, Brilliant!! @peter pott 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 don't u know that u are black and rules are not the same. So the police are holding evidence that was given them? Interesting? DCJ is a gentlemen in law This lawyer speaks down to DCJ ZONDO no1. Hard drive for brain. Remembers everything. Great that evidence can be used later. If you just tell the truth. no problem. "this lawyer reminds me of some oaks in my student days. Hard drinkers and high flyers @Ian Owen Maloney Zondo is quite sharp & experienced & this guy won't trick 
41:47,43:03, this lawyer looks a frat boy. where is this going. Tsotsis😄 @Lex Luger u spot on "ladies and gentlemen All this is proving is that the previous report was a whitewash. 😏 You must recall ke tomorrow. "tomorrow they are going to say Voila!!!

They are bluffing Yes Miss Norman He has access to all the documents but one but he's dilly dallying... lol Well done Evidence Leader "@Ian Owen Maloney But he has that familiar look "we are not dodging this. whether commission pays or state pays for embassador This means those recordings are damming. Lock them up. Adv Normzozo is correct 
45:22,46:10, shes a no nonsense fire Indeed! Thank you Ms Norman!! koloane will need 6 months. don't say that Why should you prepare if you just telling truth??😄😄 eish the month is running @Lex Luger indeed yes. She cannot keep a husband 
46:20,49:09, True colours of the Iron Lady are showing now. Musa... Order Bakiti LoL this is a special man it's only fair to give him time his argument makes sense they should have left this inquiry to the military. they are bound to fail on this one. Just imagine aunty Adv demanding answers from a husband who returns home @2AM Zuma will bewithc all these people "Lex Luger seems like the recordings are explosive 
49:28,51:07, Zuma is coming to sell the whole commission to the indian group "My sense as well washa "now tomorrow we going to hear @kgotso selome 😁😁😁😁😁 his best defence will be: sweety I was at the bar😁😁😁😁 @Tholang Mokoena if he is innocent he must just admit that Zuma gave the orders Fairness to every body hahahahah What is this sound by DJC now?

This guy want to prescribe to the DCJ This fellows will frustrate this commission and turn it upside down. Rox. And zuma is gonna demand an interpreter It's a sign of things to come @Peter pott 
56:45,59:03, "For Zuma i will need Vodka  Bruce kholoane knows his story the way he answers questions Jesus Hahahah this young lawyer must just go and buy himself X8 with Koloane 's money and it will be taken back once we start claiming all that is stolen from us Hahahah @Kgotso "we can't also dcj spending too much time here. we need him at the concourt. issue of reserve bank They are wasting our 243 Million ZAR Zuma can’t even see ha has swimming 🏊‍♂️ pool not 🔥 firepool i am with you 100% @Rox Moleme Delaying tactics
