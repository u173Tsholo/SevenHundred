time,26:04,message masilindeni ntozakuthi ‘‘ who is speaking now no arrests will be made like all other problems lot of people in SAA has eaten tax payer s monies "Yes Surely we will see people prostituted towards the end of commission Correct Born free its bad that some employees at SAA were given retrenchments packages while politicians are chowing the monies 
26:06,31:40, They've already prostituted themselves. "this poor woman tried everything she could to save money and protect SAA NPA is busy now compiling all evidence they might collect and carry on with more investigation to charge those executives and politicians Yes Suzanne those who tried eventually resigned leaving the poor SAA to the hands of looters As citizens in this country we need to keep fighting this anti corruption fight... billions and billions of rands! "@suzanne saunders she tried but her voice was ignored "This makes me so angry Indeed our infrastructure is collapsing while billions are spend on these SOE s Thats why i am saying... we as citizens should support these people who fight. 
32:34,38:00, truth is so much money is been spent on this commision but yet no-one has been arrested. Is it actually worth it as we all know the truth @makhosi nobhatyi we should help these people. help them fight what they do here is so scary and big "@DJ DJ you can vote for someone else who wont have this power hungry disgusting attitude... and i dont mean a political party. they are all useless Tea time is done... back to work for me 😞 @Suzanne Saunders i did not vote for the ANC Neither did i... The Guptas had the government in their pockets which led to the enabling and looting of State funds. If we know who funds political parties do you think that it would make a difference? Would you still buy a luxury german car if you know they had given cars to the parliament for something? hey mzatsi is very hard here in south afrika 
38:07,42:44, guys don't lose hope let's trust that DCJ Zondo will help all of us by recommending prosecution of those who looted the country There are more fools out there than there are wise men. @Born free Yes - our elections proved that. i dont think that these commission will help ... "At least people can now see and understand the extent of madness we have been subject to in the last few years. We need to become an educated country and we need to teach ourselves @Derek Main I doubt that is exclusive derek because on either side of the party divide is a similar sentiment. Maybe both sides can be true simultaneously. @Norman Zwane Perhaps but I base that on the fact the we have heard of all the ANC corruption and the fools still voted for them. @Suzanne Saunders You'll be amazed how slow to learn people can be. we lived with a mad apartheid system for decades but there are adults who still have no idea how it damaged everyone. But I see It's not just a thumbsuck or guess - it has been laid bare. Only the ANC fools can't see it. 
43:52,49:27, What i can add is that i am always so happy to see people who fight. These whistle-blowers and people like Thuli Madonsela have my utmost respect. These are the bravest people i know! @Norman Zwane why cant you teach people? This level of corruption has nothing to do with Apartheid but everything to do with Incompetence and greed and a culture of greed. "Amen Nkosi "@Derek Main Yeah. we all take long to learn. Imagine after the Un declared apartheid a crime against humanity and some blunt knives still voted to uphold its proponents "This commission is different with others that was held before "@Norman Zwane Totally agree with that - they supported the Nats to the end. So the more things change The ANC have become the Nats. "Apartheid didnt leave anyone unscathed. My dad was stabbed by a protester in 1977 while he was teaching in JHB De Korte street 
50:25,53:10, "I still have hope in Ramaphosa @makhosi nobhatyi I would love to be able to do that - I just can't see it under an ANC government. Apartheid remains only with the guilty. Move forward it is nothing but a word of obstruction.. @Suzanne Saunders Taught experience is trumped by lived experience. Personally my lived experience is to be weary of being in agreement with folks who are not Black. Well perhaps its time to find new experiences... @Born free You sure lived on the 'other side of the track'. @Moahi hlapolos yes that happened before but this time around things will change those people who have given authority to act law push them to do so. That is why parliament will be investigated The makeup artist lady suppose to be in entertainment industry After 25 years you finally decide to find new experiences. You only live once.. move forward it will lead to progress. 
54:13,56:43, @Suzanne Saunders Big gamble for me. I have a baggage of experience versus a glimpse of hope. The dice is loaded in favour of my lived experience. wish it was easy to move on. I still have hope in SA - even though we have had a tough past. but you cant move forward if the past hangs like a heavy horrid stone around your neck. @Born free its never to late. DCJ Zondo is clever he ordered parly to be investigated knowing that by the time his report arrive there isn't watered down "@Derek main I am pleading you to watch @Norman Zwane We are all scarred by our lived experience in SA - some more than others. @Norman Zwane i know exactly what you mean. I also have experiences. I think everyone has. Thats what makes this reconciliation so hard. some people cannot escape their own mental slavery. @makhosi nobhatyi Believe me I'll speak my mind. I just feel that we are just kicking the can down the road. "@Suzanne Saunders It don't hang like some diamond stone on my neck 
57:23,59:51, @makhosi nobhatyi This brother Derek is in desperate need for help. Find some psychologist please. I am in Cape Town and i guess he's in Gauteng. I would love to help him or connect him with some. "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU If you have a point to make @Derek Main from scared to scarred when we start throwing F words around (Fools in your case) "@Norman Zwane not a diamond ok ok ok back to work now. whahahah @Norman Zwane That was the politetest word I could think of. "@Derek main your concern is everyone concerned but we have hope in this administration "@makhosi nobhatyi Its not normal to see someone this negative "@Suzanne Saunders I hate to agree with you 
1:01:30,1:04:25, @makhosi nobhatyi I'm afraid I don't have your optimism. The rot is too deep. "@makhosi nobhatyi Yeah Ramaphosa "@Derek Main If you are being honest & not sacarstic then I'm afraid you come across as insensitive Zondo WANTS THE LOO hOW IS IT PEOPLE?? @Norman Zwane What do you think I'm being sarcastic about? he is human @Sthakathi Khumalo "@Derek Main Too deep "@Derek Main Your application of the word ""FOOLISH"". I doubt that you intended to use it in politenes as you sacarstically claim." 
1:04:35,1:10:34, "There is a hope in this administration @Sthakathi Khumalo 3 Cheers. Umbonile!! @Norman Zwane OK - please explain to me how people can riot in the streets against poor service delivery one day and the next vote for the very party failing at service delivery. That's a fool. "Only one problem I have now Mkhwebane seems she is working for an agent so I don’t trust her she failed twice in her report "Advocate Hofmeyer is back @Norman Zwane Then they are even more foolish to think those are the only parties they could have voted for. "@Derek main people protest is our rights to demand these services so that government may improve it "@makhosi nobhatyi That doesn't make any sense. Surely you vote for them because you think they are capable of delivering. If they fail "@Derek Main well you are correct again 
1:11:08,1:16:47, @Norman Zwane I can definitely see that it messed with education. Yo @Derek Main education? What education? as far as apartheid was concerned we should only have learnt how to take instructions - period. @Don Johnson Now that slavery is abolished - yes @Norman Zwane I agree with you - and the ANC are taking full advantage of that. @Norman Zwane Take a look at the education system now. Is it better? " so was money stolen only came on line know "@Derek Main If I was the ANC I would too 
1:16:50,1:19:44, ANC government is working hard to improve the lives of the poor and better life for all really???? @Norman Zwane I've tried many routes to convince people - I've given up with that. Now I just say it like I see it. @Don Johnson Lucky fish. In that case are the slaves worth nothing then? In 25 years I have only seen how flawed the ANC is. "@Derek Main The education so jow much went into the guptas pocket @Don Johnson Go away. Let the adults speak. ha 
1:20:15,1:25:05, 206 million who recieved that please tell me @Derek Main well just dont typically give up and join them. we row against the current for our own sanity because the ANC & its cronies are a cancer that will destroy us all in the end. "Same ship SS South Africa different captain what walk did she go on "@Anne M. Please do not chase @Don Johnson away. He gives me balance what mission Yes @ Clive.. Captains of Incompetence Pilgrimage catholic

1:28:32,1:33:15, "@Don Johnson Personally I'm no keen athelete @Norman Zwane Don't entertain the trolls "Mangethe akunani ngihlushwa inakhunja yami (wifi) lapha ningathi ngidame nginyamalala and ngiyabona inxoxo iyahamba Let's hope so Muriel.. let's hope that the commission does it's job and all assets acquired by the looting of the public purse.. Will be returned to the public purse. Dem Zulu fellers know how to control the other tribes. "@Derek Main I think I took the bait there i think the assest will never be enough the cash was converted to gold and sitting in a swizz bank hi i have watched a lot of crooks movies and that what they do
