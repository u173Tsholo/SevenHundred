1:18:06,1:20:25, i think he is a fake doctor this guy. his logic doesn't add up. "Wow!  you cant plant the orange and expect to harvest mangoes......you all know when you associate yourself with zuma you already know the end product maybe dr is his name just like doctor Khumalo Dr Ngubane is like the lite version of Vuyo Ndzeku😂 NOXOLO very important point. He brushed them of in order to frustrate them and force them to resign. That was the plan. they have stolen our money's its clear from the contradictions @Moodly yes dont blame us blame the system 
1:20:26,1:21:52, very true his moves are not far from Ndzeku mxolele The commision is helping to unravel a lot of things that wre going behind our back Orange Mask Friday...

1:22:14,1:23:21, He looks cruel. I've never seen him smiling. Dr luks drained now "Dr Ngubane the wall is that can a country afford to put many politicaians to jail at once or only one like in South Korea with their PM Dr Ngubane gualified as a medical doctor at the University of Natal. he's lied himself into a corner "show time u see? His justification is so flawed it is laughable 
1:23:22,1:25:05, the caucus @ him and the aunty is going to backfire @unisa chris He is a medical doctor apparently is this real life or are we dreaming real life Dream "@Ronny Choeu he qualified at the university of Natal hahaha hungry for they wanted to be the players and referee spam me loadshedding was plan long time so that they can steal the money

I think that's wher all our problems are..:oops:we have ministers in positions that dont know anything in the field of cadre deployments.. Doctor you are so right. The Guptas saw a huge oppertunity The guy's been playing that online chess game since this commission first started years ago... of course he's tired... "i would hate to be a minister 
1:27:44,1:28:41, @fRANK a "Guys like Ngubane have nothing to offer to our country @Michael.. like our police minister...or transport minister..or minister of home affairs..all are:oops::oops::oops::oops::oops::oops: hahaha but FAMOUS BILLIONAIRE im in he's a Church guy.yhooooo Thixo uyamva lotata. they use our sputit learders @Phindi Zikalala He's a general practioner I think lol How can they allow the country to be handed over to some indian family on a plate of curry

1:30:42,1:34:42, Zondo is lenient to these ANC croocks "Phaka le nyama Just unbelievable the depths these corrupt vultures went to to destroy the lives and careers of very capable people Corruption? Where 2? Amandla... Awethu @ Mncedisi. He was too much smart to JZ @Seelan&Patsy Pillay easy baking 101 Zuma loves money and definetly they were ready to offer him that and offer them the country i thought Zuma was untouchable then loook what happened and to an extent its still happening to him. Now this Loadshedding started around 2013/14 and still today we are suffering from that and this guy is sitting here lying to us while they didn't do anything on the interest of Eskom but for the Guptas 
1:35:14,1:37:57, "How do you prove what the commission is trying to prove in one move? A ""checkmate""" also...remember what Zuma said... there will be no more load shedding..... I think he was referring to the toilet as he will no longer be eating curry..:oops::oops::oops:💩💩💩💩💥💥 hahaha Curry is a toilet's worst nightmare but my stomach's favourite dream Lie Now telling us that he had the interest of us citizens at heart. why did they go to ccma. dont lie did you steal and eat the biscuit or not? SIMPLE Loadshedding was created by these crooks for the sake of corruption The commission must check their bank accounts 
1:38:08,1:39:03, @Kabelo sebothoma .why do you say the gud dr is a liar. first place for me too bank accounts I dont think he knew his job description coz his not sure of everything come on Doctor Mondli you hit the nail on the head.

Zondo is always late y? Zondo must be tired. I don't know how he maintains the pace without losing his professional touch. what i find strange everything must go through the doctor. he signs a report and the minutes and then says that certain minutes or reports r missing .how does he no that. all of a sudden the tapes go Nice to give away R18m if it is not your money. @Eskom when you resign theyr pay you salary for a yr then you take evidence with coz its your in put knowledge Lol Once again an important document not signed yerrrrrrrrrr

He has lied himself into a corner It would be a risk to take even an injection from this Dr miss hofmeyer will tell him straight on his face he is not telling the truth. mr Zondo has all the reason to laugh CDJ laughed at the stupid answer dr Ben gave So he consults legal experts except before suspending staff for an investigation. yoh and this was the chairman of the Eskom board..

But Ngubane expect us to believe the dung he is explaining According to him its about employees dancing and being happy what about the end user the nation! this guy must be ashamed strue 🤞🤞 did they ask about contracts about exxaro @ Nathaniel Motlhasedi 🤣🤣🤣 What the chair has done has been to rubbish their reasons for the dismissals. This leaves them open to being implicated in the facilitation of the Gupta appointees. 
2:46:54,2:48:01, "I wonder  Dr Ben thinks he can fool the second highest judge in land. Nooooooo!!!! We need to Pray for South Africa ....their is plenty other board members like them helping the Looting! Stupid corrupted officials Ngubane is not too happy with Seleka right now These are the results of cadre deployment so he knew what Molefe was doing !!! what did he do? Mike this is just arrogance. coached by Bell Potinger 
2:48:15,2:50:02, "Wizz kid miss smallanyanya skeletons had confirmed that all of them were corrupt They are all corrupted to the core. Deputy Chief Justice is Definitely sharper than the Chief Justice. "another question how did dr Ben become a doctor How long will SA spend money on commissions Brian was nearly appointed by JZ to be a Minister of Finance. Oh ! Thixo wase George Goch "This Advocate has got no mercy Anwar I dont think you can make such a judgment

2:55:41,2:57:02, Yes Zondo ! Give him a lecture What due diligence did the minister and the board exercise before transferring Molefe to Eskom? The Guptas created intermediary companies to negotiate huge government deals. so that they can receive billions of Rands in commission. makawa😂😂😂😂😂 I hate avd lootiingg! Dr Ngubane had volunteered to stay it out until midnight! I doubt that he still feels the same aftet Adv. Seleka ha started plucking off on his false confidence😅 Douglas the dr calls him a wizkid p white collar criminals in South Africa should carry life in prison for embezzling public funds since death sentence is regarded unconstitutional. 
2:57:04,2:58:56, go Zondo !!!!! @ Noxolo. I will then give up to our justice system if they get loose when is Lynne Brown coming to testify?? "In 2016 Right now we need the stolen money so that the poor could be housed decently the old man is cornered now What a lecture !! by Zondo Vuleka Mhlaba uDr Ngubane angene🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ eish 
2:59:18,3:02:12, @bee-llionaire what I've observed is that White Collar Crime isn't punishable enough in #Mzansi basically you can get away with it if one understand what's meant by implied consent that is what Ben Ngubane has done lately "@BOIKANYO MOLOI I agree - white collar crime goes unpunished. But unfortunately most crime in SA goes unpunished. In SA The Gupta's and family found the money Bank = Eskom Zondo will write Volumes of Books about these rubbish eix @Derek Main it's sad indeed Siss this bra did not understand his job title at all Kubo Zondo !!! Seleka is an excellent sniper 
3:02:35,3:04:39, Honorable Dr must feel embarrassed. A man of his stature pays an employee who resigned from work. These guys must just be arrested.

We now have the sex part This guys so greede to sell our country to Guptas "The more I watch this this @ Frank Joordan . Zondo has got a memory. He must write a book "eishhh i love the chronology of the chair :elbowcough::elbowcough:once he is done gathering evidence chicken are coming home now @ Kgotso Mpete . The Dr is being buried now 
3:09:37,3:11:29, Judge Zondo has a memory of an elephant. He is absolutely brilliant!!!!! CDJ IS TRYING TO TELL DR TO BE HONEST. HE IS TIRED OF BENS LIES The Dr was right. Let's carry on until midnight "when adv s smiles the drs midnite should b now to runaway. what is the condition of his pants hope not messed This lawyer talks very slow but he's very very effective in his questioning and following up . "@Mondli Nohashe he is been buried alive It's apparently clear now that Ben is on the list of people to wear the silver bracelets! till midnight Dr 😂😂😂😂

The Dr requested midnight Baldwin Sipho “Ben” Ngubane held multiple positions in the post-apartheid government. He was an IFP leader who crossed the floor to ANC.

3:56:10,3:58:26, @Chsrles Maluleke : Viva @Charles suit yourself buddy .. This guy was a Molefe cheer leader. the transformation was the increased and open looting that happened @dada ngova thanks buddy if anyone think I must support their narrative blindly then tough @Kevin Simon The fact that he says he knew nothing of Molefe's criminal actions at Transnet when it was public knowledge beggars belief. It's BS. greetings to all How many people will be arrested here 
3:58:34,4:00:57, greeting to you too this Dr Ngubane must be locked up nxe @Ntsikelelo Mgxigxwà hello elo @Charles Maluleke:washhands::washhands: 😭 baby brain Molefe increased Eskom debt to 450billion. with increasing loadshedding @thabo elias all of them 😂 "all these issues were brought up while he was chairperson @mkhwanazi Lemo that means we are talking about ANC as a whole

4:04:13,4:07:59, someone within DMR knew about all this looting. Dr might be regretting saying mid night So did they decide to find a smarter skelm for Eskom or were they trying to fix the problem? "they must go to Robben Island @Aubrey De Bliquy Probably still being looted. @Mondli Nohashe We need to design new uniforms for them with a target on heir backs. this whole inquiry will come nothing i swear the old toppie wont remember anything about august 2015 "Just so it's clear to everyone 
4:08:07,4:13:59, fruitless exercise "@Charles Maluleke that's true Are these guys on steroids? Are they talking Dr Ngubane on on his midnight challenge? this thief thinks he can protect all the other thieves involved in the looting of eskom. amnesia seems to be taking over now I wonder how the dr will respond to this evidence contradicting him he probably wont remember or say ramahlodi is lying "lol @Bohlale Matubatuba he's probably dripping in sweat @Bohlale Matubatuba he's looking stressed thinking about his next lie 
4:15:17,4:23:08, Is Zondo the President now ? @Keegan he looked surprised look at Dr now @Bohlale Matubatuba you're right he's also definitely regretting why he offered to sit till midnight😂 the capture of eskom was systematically planned. all the role players were properly trained "lol And they all reported to one fellow @Nathaniel Motlhasedi Yes - all orchestrated by the Guptas. the truth is about to come

Also how he is able to keep his cool even in the presence of ppl like Ndzeku. "@Sipho Mahlangu true @Nature Mkhatshwa ...very true Bt @Charles Maluleke dada probably lost connection😂 Keegan very true I dint feel for him 🤣🤣 So they will not talk about the cash suitcases after the curry dinners at Saxonwold "🤣🤣🤣He probably ren away
