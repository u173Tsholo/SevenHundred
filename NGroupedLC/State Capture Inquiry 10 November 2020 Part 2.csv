Only looming arrests and warrant of arrest denials.... we can pretend we have teeth like hofmeyr &smile widely at ace news 😁 Hi @Smart Guys We are trying to raise the level of conversation by identifying and blocking irritating trolls who just post lots of spam posts which is anti-social and inconsiderate. Hi @Naledi Barron and @FieliesSA Fielies Warrant of arrest issued-Google it State Security Agency Domestic Branch Manager under investigation for alleged fraudulent qualifications. "Heya @Aubrey De Bliquy. Yes

-3:48,-1:36, will kate b in belinda no My apologies @Heather Durr I did not see. I dont want him to be arrested because he still needs to spill the finals beans at the state capture and give up his co-conspirators. @Belinda Stiging still campaigning online for the EFF and Malema thru diverse channels? @FieliesSA hi @ALTA hello #BlondeCookieLover 74 What are the charges against Zille? "How will that work? If he is in custody it will be easier for him to appear sabc late again

Whether you call it work "@Zinhle Big Daddy Dee The thing about the EFF is they get some important things right that nobody else does I did not expect this witness to be on for so long. At first I thought he was aloof but he seemed to have taken a stance against corruption. @BlondeCookieLover 74 Tracy Zille fake news twitter is appearing before Court - nothing to do with Helen Zille "Why don’t y’all just leave @SanFran Arnold do you see me B "Everyone is against corruption 
3:21,6:20, @ALTA I can see you between Zondo and SABC who is always late B🤗🤗😘😘 thx @Gina deW Like some people believe the Guptas are disruppting White Monopoly Capital. LOL ...True... "@FieliesSA But when it suits u  I can see magashule is in soweto and look disappointed and he is denying any warrant of arrest @Aubrey De Bliquy EFF is the future 
6:21,8:02, Witness also looks like Gianni Versace Anyone here interested in what I think about the ANC ? Nonesense he is too dark ...The Monopoly of White Minority Capital..is correct @Val Speirs ... man! @Piet Vast You have told us that for a month. Perhaps the EFF today? "@ Aubrey de Bliquy OK. EFF = ANCYL in red T-shirts "BREAKING NEWS 
8:26,9:48, all I'm saying is that eff were moered in brackenfell yesterday😂😂 they thought they were dealing with clicks Malema : I will never start an own political party. And.......he was correct @Russia I hope that arrest will be Hollywood style @zip reeper enjoy your lunch wors and mash love it @Rene Ngwenya victim is a relative term. @Russia Magezi 🙄 I have never supported them. Malema is wolf in sheep clothing. They are populist and prone to violence. There is no place for them in SA "A warrant of arrest has been issued for the ANC’s secretary-general Breaking News : Warrant of arrest has been issued for ANC SG Ace Magashule. 
9:48,11:19, EFF 'protecting the state institutions'......... Malema : We have no corrupt officials in the EFF...... @ALTA Ja Ace moet vir hom kry "@Aubrey de Bliquy Magashule is expected to appear in court this week. Scorpio brings you this exclusive. Hy is Min Gepla Daily Maverick @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee My difficulty is that WMC is simply nonsense because it is based on the false premise of group guilt. It is unhelpful and inaccurate. @zip reeper beslis ace was the main brain 
11:29,13:16, someone needs to move @Aubrey you are talking to a rock @ALTA Die hele blik kantien is vrot @Alta of you can block big daddy then you should also block zip reeper. They are the same "@Valenci The warrant of arrest is not really new news... His arrest however would... The question is WHY did you do this -money? "...Yes @zip reeper ja kom ons wees positief al die crooks gaan gevang word 
13:19,14:43, "Malema and Ndlozi 'paying tribute to Winnie's funeral' @FieliesSA Apparently Ace is expected to appear in court next week. Magashule will make his first appearance in the Bloemfontein High Court as early as this week and that he has been given an opportunity to voluntarily present himself to the authorities. Just in from news 24. Warrant of arrest for Ace Magasula has been issued. Valencia zip never do me harm he is a friend "@ALTA .. nee wat "@Valencia J @Alta for real? 🤔🤔 @Aubrey De Bliquy True! And a person's mind it like a parachute. It only functions when open. 
14:55,16:20, I saw on google trend Ace was calling on Biden to lift Zimbabwe sanctions. Anybody else thinking he might have political plans there...? @zip reeper wees positief @Naledi Barron I love your little nugges of wisdom. Valencia zip never insulted me Fielies please clarify. @Naledi if only Often we misunderstand one another. @Aubrey De Bliquy xx Piet Vast please 
16:58,19:42, @Kevin Simon He is cosing up to Zanu-PF by buying brownie points. Thus whey will accept him IF he tries to go over(and have a future)... "...A wise man once said *they "@FieliesSA Ace was attempting to find an international ""voice"" by making statements regarding the U.S election. Problem is But he is not Zimbabwean. Unless you think it's asylum? @Lee D. Hendrix Why? A wise man? Anc -eff is equal to lion -black mamba I don't get it. EFF history lesson : Shaka Zulu was a peaceful man who couldn't hurt a fly. btw the king invented the steam machine. 
19:53,21:29, "Yah @Naledi Barron you are probably right. My theory might be core of a conspiracy :). Yes @Kevin Simon "@Valencia J There are many with very fixed P.O.Vs @FieliesSA I wouldn't put anything past Ace! Warrent of arrest issued to ACE MAGASHULE ace says he is not aware of a warrant of arrest @Smart Guys Yes. Interesting days....... How are you going to solve the land inequity if you reject coherent and efficient executive and rule of law? "@Naledi I find most of them influenced by some or other outside force. I respect self made opinions more leaving anc and join Eff is like running from black mamba and entering lion's den 
21:42,23:06, is it true about ace? @ma baker on 7th Nov he admitted he knows that a warrent has been issued Agree @Valencia J. You'll get no argument from me! @LionView WHat is happening with Ace? @LionView what about Ace? ...@ Aubrey De Bliquy; A wise man vented his vision. Ace will not say it's a political witch hunt ace arrested re bloem asbestoes rumours 👻 I personally am convinced that the delay in resolving the urgent land inequity question is being delayed by the notion it can be advanced at the expense of law and order. We are democratic. 
23:47,26:23, on enca now. he is campalgning in Soweto. @Lee D. Hendrix was it a vision or an hallucination? switching over to witness it I mean I don't eeven understand what it means. word salad. ek sal so bly wees as 'n Ace kan val. hy het ons al die middelvinger gegee 👺🤬😠 "Even though im unemployed We make the law. 100 years go men believed heavier than air flight was impossible while birds flew overhead since Adam. @Bradley Gother Well done you!!
