VBS Looting @Lorna Kavanagh VBS.HEHEHEHEHE 
1:39:14,1:42:29, "Whoever contributed to CR17 nothing wrong Right hand "Daud Musa Problem is the equity in the name of the ANC in the mind of the electorate. Else just form a new party. See where that got MANY smaller parties in May! "To wage war Think CR should go Zondo and just spill the beans. "We were all concerned about NDZ being delivered by Zuma which spoiled every strategy she might have to take over "When CR17 won 18 months ago just wait till the NDZ campaign funders are revealed

For the second time of asking. Do you blame the whities for the mess SA is in right now? don't you think is time for the nation to also deliberate on the impact that On Point and VBS looters had in limpopo as well? "@ Nonhlanhla Ntombela PP is lacking experience in how to conduct her investigation In ANC can someone love South Africa and rescue it from this hyenas? why ok 
1:55:26,1:58:53, "@Thando.
