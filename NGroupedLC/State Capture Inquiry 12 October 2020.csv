3:44:40,3:45:07, no that's banna I am worried about this thought process How can Database Layman be aware of risks? He was advised by experts with Masters in accounting and some of them are lawyers. "very dishonest not taking responsibility  Mambo jambo So much money lost under your watch "I'm saying this as layman ""this man wants to pass the buck" He must be held accountable for this huge loss of money... leave the zwane's the zuma's and gashule's alone till you prosecute those who killed our people in boipatong and other townships in our country during apartheid 
3:45:08,3:45:52, Who has got the money now? Suddenly he is a layman. No responsibility. You lying thief.

We want tro hear fro the Premier now they should make the accounting officer the MEC What is entailed as the oversight duty? Zwane’s evidence is collapsing now. 
3:51:04,3:51:20, Same wave length he didnt do his job.....period now we know why Zwane was made an MEC and a Minister LAYMAN - a person without professional or specialized knowledge in a particular subject. Now he is in trouble ayeye "Zwane stop playing karate games with Chinese Mr Clayman has lost his smile and giggle today talk mr thug

3:53:42,3:54:03, @Neo Ramatsebe Incompitant is an understatement ho boima katlego 😳😳 justice is on him like hot butter 😂 "his oversight was to open the houses "he knew exactly what he was doing I hope that the Zondo commission will make a recommendation that will disqualifies incompetent and uneducated politicians from being in charge of any department You are not qualified for such contracts obvious if incompetence was a person... whats the point of having politicians in those positions 
3:54:07,3:54:26, Layman does NOT mean a man who lies onto of his job Waste of Oxygen no you useless.
