Chartered Accountant.... He is corrupt 
33:24,36:31, Zondo is on his left. Check his glance the OTHER direction Everything didn’t go according to plan with this guy and his company He should be a addressing Chairman Zondo when he answers questions. Giving the profession a bad name... adding to what KPMG did @Quinton Ndzinisa Or at least looking at the Judge Right @Thando Nkutha clap him wena Eish.... she is on fire with this crook loving her 
36:59,39:27, "Yip did guy might get a speech stroke It's such a shame our country it's poor today because of this crooks they must rot in jail!!!

39:38,40:43, if the guy was in court he was nt gonna make it @Mriam sijyo our country is not poor. Our politicians are the ones who monopolized our economy by exposing our rich resources to the foreigners and cults! she toying with him now This guy is a pathological liar This guy is finished Very well thank you @I am free 🖐 I’m surprised he hasn’t confessed yet. I would have confessed to something I ddnt do if I was his position. this one is ready for jail chair "until Jacob zuma spend maybe at least 4hour behind bars then i can agree corruption has come to an end in SA

The AFU must attach her assets 😂😂😂 Ewald Kruger 
48:44,51:56, she's so polite as she tears you to pieces he is sitting on a ticking time bomb Take that KLAP water please bring in the cuffs and take him away yah he is leading him she is a sharp advocate people are playing with their profession what a look 
52:19,54:15, I always think leading is misleading he leading again the sad part is paying this lawyers and ending up guilty and go to jail Eish Mara🤔 he is leading the witness again she is difficult to go pass her trying to repair the damage I hear you Rox Moleme He is driving the witness to the corner "hahahah @Wilson lawyers don't help u not to be found guilty in most times 
54:40,55:42, very difficult to repair the damage his has already done The lawyer is paid and he's leading his client to safety net but the net will have holes anyway @Tholi he is a farmer misquandaring as a lawyer 😂😂😂 Damage control damage control.... too little too late and he is leading all the time masquerading 😂😂 this lawyers land must be expropriated now he drank his money... hahahah heavy drinker this one 
55:52,57:37, all yes now He’s telling the witness’s story he is failing the country The only way this higher standard for corrupt "Only way this ""democracy"" will survive is when they eliminate corruption and racist BEE and BBBEE laws." @david cele u been bzy viva eff lol This lawyer is very arrogant and disrespectful if i sign any finacials of my company i always take it home apen most of the evening to see what and where the money went so i can have the qeustions if there are any and do not land up here lol 
57:41,59:27, well done Hoffmeyer he is asking closed leading questions. is this guy lawyer? what is wrong with hofmeyer she should rev this guy @david cele no ways ...we can argue ( robustly) the people on the ground needs to take the politicians to task @Abe Molefe Advocate yes this what i mean Exactly my point the excuse that he was under the impression that he was signing accurate statements is a lot of bull. That's why we have cases such as steinhoff and others @Abe Molefe we need to expropriate his degree too 
59:45,1:01:11, checques n balances into his pocket This guy thinks he's smart...sneaky I don't care about race. Eliminate the criminals and BEE and BBBEE structure completely. "this guy is working on my nerves  Lawyers lawyering lol where did this Jan study? I think he entered the arena to wrap up the cross examination 0 this lawyer trying to patch up the holes 
1:01:18,1:02:03, Zondo is irritated he is an heavy weight amongst the leading advocate socieety and is owner of a big advocate team with very high cost per minute In the morgue Argument dont cross question the judge looks like Trugel his wearing lol l really wouldn't hire this one This lawyer is not representing his profession well @Salmaan Abrahams Very much indeed is just that he is professional in giving fair chances 
1:02:24,1:03:21, Exactly Mr Zondo Zondo does not like this dude's attitude 😀 lol he is cross examining himself mos He is arguing like Dali Mpofu but why general submission if he is claiming inconsistancies he is the type of laywers that defends white collar criminals that is his field He is professional Inconsistencies could be lies Mr Lawyer? @Sindiswa Moolman very much probably same school of thought 
1:03:34,1:04:23, Lol @ Sindiswa some said we must expropriate his degree kkķkkkķk.l agree with that yes he is he gets paid veeeeery wel for doing that smile Ms Hoffmeyer was not making enough progress @david vele Watson is around Dubai baba 10 years to come he will be back "No this guy is wasting time without compensation kwaaks @Matthew Moyo with no absolute compensation 
1:04:27,1:05:01, "The slower he speaks lol Iike his pushback thou..reminds me of Steven Segal I’m sure this lawyer wears a strong cologne @Matthew Moyo i said we must expropriate his degree ...he probably stole it like the land This man doesn’t not respect judge even when he was here b4 yhoooo this guy time is money @Danie hahahah is he an Uber? This guy is being ridiculous! 
1:05:01,1:06:17, Dali Mpofu believed his argument is the rcorrect argument and every should agree with him @Rox Moleme steven seagal hahahaha Anyway if DPCI haven't spoken to him then they can't be investigating the matter. Why has no one raised this with the DCJ? sorry to say gavin is cold in a mortuary do not play around with missary on the familys part "It's fun to see criminals in the hot seat. But lets forget the hot seat. Put them in prison He is not cross examining You will have to pay the ANC Crooks for and you won't get any land for free "Now he is leading 
1:06:24,1:07:09, How big was the R9m received from van Wyk relative to Neo's other income. "Danie "and the same way zuma will die of ""natural"" causes before testefying here" When confronted by three criminals in a dead end and you only 2 bullets! One is a Lawyer and the other two are murderers. What do you do? give it to him Hoffmeyer Why the obsession with Dali mpofu Zondo stop this clown leading who? this guy can't be a leader 😂 shoot the laywer twice 
1:07:15,1:08:09, what an arrogant creature this advocate.... act as if he is Gods gift to humanity...... look at patel now 😂😂😂😂😂😂 While doing so Dali fails to support his arguments with law @Tholithemba Ntsele he all of a sudden smooth "the largest public transport industry in south I guess it's just a lawyer doing what he gets paid to do... "zondo  Mpofu is not a great lawyer! He is emotional and populist1 
1:08:12,1:09:19, and gets paid a lot "This witness should've continue selling his duvets and Tupperware Hawks probably don't need his evidence. (Hopefully) Then he can be prosecuted too. [doubt it though] My point exactly @thando cezula Tholithemba Ntsele there’s no comparison leading again no mahn "Lol Is this lawyer sober? 
1:09:33,1:11:20, news 24....??ogh please.???...they are the liars.... can someone necklace him please substance a use yes substance abuse 23 min now at 2.00 a min he realy pulling it listen how slow he talks lol] 2.3k a min @Salmaan Abrahams thats a death sentence be gentle Yes @Thando Nkutha I like the confidence of this lawyer on the floor now. I hope he's not instructed to sit down with all thes leading questions. 
1:11:26,1:12:28, my legal person are on a retainer at about 5 percent as what this shark is charging @Jacob Zuma i dnt have an issue with taking a criminal to street justice leading meaning the witness is put in a situation in which he can't answer questions in his own way because the questioner leads him to answer in a certain way I have problem with this lawyer trying to disrupt the process and in the first time this witness was here the same lawyer tried the same tactics & was shut down by CJ 1/2 Ignorance of the law is no excuse. sadly CJ allowed Mr Sikhakhane to do worst for Zuma so I don’t know how to block this one today 2/2 he should have told him long time ago before arrive at the commission why now its rehearsed anyway guilty as charged 
1:12:33,1:13:37, so they are ..ai mean the Zondo commision is asking for clearity on clear clearity....hààaaaaa Now his witness can only agree with him @Matthew Moyo without saying much yes you can hear he has been prepared for this qeustions baba Zuma patel is confident now where is Zondo now???? patel is calmer too Natasen @salmaan Abrahams Zone will strike any time 
1:13:40,1:14:25, puting cheese in the mouse trap "if all is inline with law CA shame @Salmaan Abrahams Who is Patel that you keep referring to? does any one know who or which ambulance or Rescue company were on Watsons...scene.?.... the witness lol " "This lawyer is representing his client effectively He is Vivien Natasen. 
1:14:30,1:15:58, lol Leading the witness continuesly....... my buddy looks like him and my buddy is a patel@Pastor J will Hofmeyer get another chance after this oke ? Do you believe you should not be prosecuted? NO Why Zondo allow this to go on? @Jacob Zuma dnt you belong in prison She can’t get a second bite @Thembelani Mayoli the first that was there were the intelegence agency then a towtruck driver phoned emergency services and the police were as always the last the nia left after watson was decleared dead they neverleft 
1:16:04,1:17:06, Witness looks like an alien. Like from outer space. ET call home. When is Van Wyk coming? He looks like Doctor Evil @Thando Nkutha is knew yes This guy should be added to the case and let the judge decide in the trial. So many leading questions. Tough times!! thanks @Moolman shabir sheik type of justice he do look a bit sick 
1:17:13,1:18:18, @Jacob Zuma coloured is just an off-shoot of black even whites @Jacob Zuma thats fine hahaha @Jacob Zuma all races comes from black race Poverty breeds criminals "Danie Where is Brain van Wyk?? so to me being called anything doesnt effect me 😀 indeed @Born free ​ he looks like Doctor Evil 
1:18:57,1:20:23, Hope he’s next @Comcerned South African So Zuma I get to keep my land zondo what is wrong with you now Brian not Brain Sorry! 🤔🤔🤔🤔How does an accused person bring in his or her own lawyer to question him on behalf of the persecutor? It’s very bizarre what is going on and Zondo silent that is info that will come out i do not want to discuss what my friend the owner of the tow truck company told me The chair is buying time now "@Jacob Zuma coloured are racist with eachother too  its just stupidity 
1:20:53,1:23:14, Thanks Danie.... Yes Zuma I originate from the Khoisan Tr @Jacob Zuma race shld not be an argument because all nations comes from the blacks I come from the original Bushmen There was no due diligence needed. They both knew what they were doing was wrong. who is Google mr Zuma @Jacob Zuma ( white pretending to be black) i have no issue coz all races comes from blacks @Salmaan Abrahams no i do not say that your coments are race based why @Thando Nkutha i was just thinking zondo needs to stop this 
1:23:37,1:25:31, No our Khoisan ancestors would be crawling in their graves. Khoisan one and only true South African "Obviously can't re-examine his own client properly... line of questioning is poor @Danie Nilsen sorry must have meant to refer to someone else Cheers All. I should watch for completeness sake but I can't. @Concerned South African watch it later sidney prepared questions as if he is not guilty this guy looks like one of the Schaikes brothers @Salmaan Abrahams even refering to some one else it still race based and i aked why the race card 
1:25:44,1:27:02, @Refiloe Nkabinde jor bra true ne His leading questions aren’t helping. Maybe that’s why the Chair isn’t bothered Mr President Jacob Zuma and Land is ours. Land belongs only to the Khoisan @Vukani Mngomezulu who is ours @Danie Nilsen ZUMA came on about coloureds i was responding by saying i dntbhave issue coz all races stems ffrom blacks "Rob Nel so every nation's roots are black yes all races are all equal but others are more equal n than others 
1:27:15,1:28:08, Salmaan it's in the genes THIS LAWYER ALSO ...IS NOT POLISHED FOR THE THIS KIND OF VENTURE HE IS USED TO OLD STYLE OF DEFENSE no bantus came to South Africa from congo The Bantu and Zulus came from other countries in Africa Not South Africa no this lawyer is playing games zulus are bantus nonsense stop this hippie zondo 
1:28:17,1:28:58, Only the Khoisan were here first we came to South Africa first THIS IS REHEARSED @Salmaan Abrahams as coulerds are ofshoots of white people why is this important we are all just people with diffrent colors and cultures and lets leave it at that amateur khoisans r not bantus Haha Zuma they might become white @Danie Nilsen that was close to my point khoisans are nilotic 
1:29:02,1:30:02, "Sounds just like Zuma Zondo is stupid; last time he let Sikhakhane to do worse than this for Zuma so now CJ have to swallow this unacceptable model Sidney has realised that his client has been exposed and there is nothing to protect and cover up. He has also been defeated by the lady advocate to the extent he can't ask relevant questions. Born free what about zmaphungubwe which is in Mpumalanga yacoob the land is for us "@Jacob Zuma we must take the land  No cross examination is with kit gloves bantus are from Congo stop insulting my race 
1:30:24,1:32:11, even though khoisans n bantus intemarried @Jacob Zuma i identify as a black you looking for trouble but i can supply you tik if u want even bantus are settler in s. a @Salmaan Abrahams explanation acceptedd @Jacob Zuma is geroek "yacoob Zuma you are a Ulundian 
1:32:14,1:34:51, "@Saskia i agree  R300k in safe and happens to be the same amount that van wyk wants...also happens to be asked not around the same time that it was received... he's a p*?s very crooked accounting cover up "@Jacob Zuma they are way more than mogerals This is just orgainsed crime but now they make it look like it is Okay.... "these two are joined at the hip the Caucasians have a mission to help the bantus @Thando Nkutha Yes he was told to come and lie unfortunately his lies has back fired on him 
1:34:59,1:36:53, the chairperson has already made up his mind ..this is now a waste of time "@Saskia zuma a fake he is looking to stoke here Are we still in re-examination or what? money laundering is a profesional busness and needs clever laywers to assit and sometime leads this types of organized crime @Jacob Zuma we will expropriate all land even urs lol @Danie Nilsen very true @Jacob Zuma sure ...anytime if you keep on with this jz you will get it 
1:37:02,1:37:58, "if its not a loan  there we go again 😒 I smell sewerage hahahaha zondo is gatvol now This grease haired due is rude and wrong i will not let any body just take my land or property alive so we must both sides be prepared to die before it is just take is not on give me an offer and we can discus it this Caucasian is a great lawyer and look who is entitled now? 😂😂😂😂

1:39:29,1:40:38, "HE WAS CALLED TO ORDER THE LAST TIME HE WAS HERE The due with no hair has taken money into his private account from someone. and then moved it. without checking where it came from. that's money laundering. ZONDO stop this one feel free on going for inkandla our tax money went in there millions of it very arrogant for nonsense go to your kraal jz Zondo kick out this arrogant man He gives lawyers a bad name (if that's possible) this one is feisty - witness will nw think they are criminals 
1:40:42,1:41:20, "look at his dressing He wants to do things his own way and is very rude. Fantastic to be brought to court and then given the chance to have your own lawyer replace the persecutor against you. "@Jacob Zuma u conflicted  He looks Like MAGAT MA GHANDI "@Lourens De Jager ...dude I'm still lost on ""I'm entitled...""😱" cant stand his attitude at 2.3k zar a minute he is reaping it tshwane yes you correct

"Judge Zondo must put this man in his place The cry of being entitled is an act of desperation to try and save his client who has been exposed for who he is. A crook. I like this advocate looks like some people have disagreed with him in his past. it shows on his nose. leading questions again Michael wild hahahaha 
1:43:29,1:45:16, @mxolisi buthelezi at least apartheid police arested criminals and did not wait for crap commisions to make very expesive findings after all the guilty are dead or in mexico not intended haha!

1:49:28,1:50:04, i don't get as why people are saying apartheid police arrested criminals when we all the truth. Zondo is gonna deal with him professionally before adjournment. "Zondo is gonna eat him for dinner tonight Would Jacob Zuma next time offer the chance to have his own lawyer questioning him on behalf of the leading witness like today? Who are you @Born free? Are you for real? I think he was also been recorded this lawyer is arrogant He represents that African Lady that has gone into hiding blocked born free

I saw his pic on Google @Thembelani Mayoli 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ we have problems here @ Sindiswa Moolman Where's our racist friend Fils..? looking for some tissues ...Ignorance of the Law as a professional is not an excuse to deposit capitol in a personal or business account under interest bearing regulations. prove that the call was not planned Anyone born in SA or has taken the oath of allegiance to become a SA citizen is a South African citizen This man is guilty that’s all we are tracing this Jacob Zuma 
2:01:50,2:03:09, Can the commission get the date those calls were made and from where? i am asking @Sindiswa Moolman oh okay. Ayashis' amateki la! "the guy that says ""ALL RISE"" did u c his walk?" "I wonder whether "thanks Zuma @david valid point raised hey... "different countries

LOL @Saskia hahahahahahaha @ Thando Nkutha this guy recorded what he thinks he will defend himself with but that record doesn’t have substantial evidence which excludes him What is realy Zondo doing here today? Is not this a play to lose case therefore wasting public money? Haibo Zuma you wrong bra try again "This remainds me of the proverb that says that ""A drawing man will catch a straw"" I am sure this lawyer is really desperate to save his client." "One more time Zuma "I cant wait for the re-examination. This idiot just dug himself a very deep and dark hole by saying 5 times ""but i helped you"" He earlier said this was project finance for a farm" 
2:05:16,2:14:24, Block Zuma and Fils. I cant because they already blocked by my profile so I can see there chats. they are just royal pains. baiting everyone. Ow..JZ in the house "Michael Sho Zuma @Michael Wild Block them long ago. Chickens are coming home to be roast after hearing the tape recording on the today's state capture inquiry...yoh! maybe we'll need more prisons to be built many people are on their way in... Natasen prepared that recording to cover himself and throw Brian under the bus. Unfortunately Brian wasn’t aware that this was recorded Brian embezzled billions of rands he must account If you do a crime you have to be punished Ja ja: 
2:15:45,2:25:10, Elizabeth and pay back the money "With the recordings "Life as a way of balance things Some people thought they were untouchables now is the end of the road for looters I I hope life balances out the deepseated greed and criminality that is embedded itself in public and private institutions in SA.
