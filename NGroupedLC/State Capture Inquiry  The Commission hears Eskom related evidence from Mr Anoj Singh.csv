18:40,19:23, They are all in the same WhatsApp group as Zuma. Professional shirkers  who is the man with the red tie just hand over to the NPA @Antoinette Meyer - yeah quite peculiar that all the de-colonisation and black excellence activists seem to prefer legal representation with a distinctly pale complexion This is unacceptable ... the commission has limited time. they should be fined for unnecessary delay tactics  This is truly unacceptable-I wonder if DCJ can force him to testify on what they have. Seleka is ready zuma tricks at play mxm 
19:30,20:17, "🤣🤣🤣🤣Quinton @Antoinette Meyer Say no more maybe she has links to the G's jm myself that is a terrible thing to say!!

It's been months and months that they've known he must appear at the commission.  "Anoj affidavit: ""Dear DCJ

Have a great day unprofessional  HAHAHHAHAHAHAHA The English man messed on this one  "Adv. Seleka Give Adv Seleka time to talk weeejy @Siyanda Mhlongo I don't think it's incompetence.
