"these people must just be arrested once and for all @Yin yang this commission is already costing us millions for it to happen we will take to the str if this ppl dont get arrested I will join you Bridgette @ YIN Yang we are tired of corruption 
34:13,54:27, This commission presents golden opportunity to CR to uproot corruption and restore the already tarnished image of the ANC no free education but free flow money Anc is corrupt to the core this guy just knows money. and he is sooo calm this guy seems to be more factual "I simply admire ADV Maleka @Yin Yang Transnet is too much of a mess - that will cause load-shedding for sure "corruption is a virus..""Samora Machel """ "Whatever starts as an infection if not treated immediately "Cell phone 
58:20,1:05:35, CR says he will only act on a report from the commission on cabinet members...the commission needs to wrap up ESKOM and issue a report.... otherwise nothing will happen as the it will go on for ever CR must just act now bfore commission ends Soon as the government get hold of the reserve bank it will be game over 100 rand to the us/dollar Exactly Hello to all my Bantus in 2 months time SA will collapse "The move onto ...Transnet this commission will be busy for years and years if they don't issue reports ASAAP and not at the end Literally gonna run out of money and then they will have to print more money zimbabwe/venezuala style 
1:05:55,1:09:02, problem is that ANC wont go after parliamentarians only after people outside government look at Agrizzi Exactly agreed Welton yes we are no longer fooools @Robert Russell Don't forget about the cell companies - their capture of the state also needs investigating @Russell I agree with you....im sure now they can see the problem they must issue the report ASAP even a blind man can see i would say arrest parliamentarians first and send a stern warning to the rest and the world. "It is scary  
1:09:37,1:24:13, Seems like nothing has changed in the ANC - still protecting the corrupt criminals in their ranks. They deserve to be punished at the polls @ying yang very much so Yip.... who wants to take a chance of naming all the implicated ministers... ?????? the whole cabinet of JZ was corrupt "Verwoerds son is here also Maleka taking noted some point 😳😳 kuzonyiwa for those who are implicated and being charged @Robert Russell ..it will be easier to name those that are NOT implicated...😂 in hind sight you are 100% right....
