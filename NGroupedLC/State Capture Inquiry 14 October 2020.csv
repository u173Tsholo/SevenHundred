Afriforum and the farming community will ask overseas sponsors for assistance. @Eddie Reddy Agree. But I feel that the JZ-Gupta cabal did try to compromise him! "@Val protect yourself however you see fit She laughed. oh woe 
1:43:46,1:46:12, The solution is to be forearmed and forewarned. Imagine she laughed......... @Val Speirs it is indeed outrageous what is happening to our farmers. Considering the fact that they are our key to food security. But we should be wary to incite violence. looks like the lovechild of bheki Cele and Tokyo @Val Speirs Afriforum is a inevitable player. Just one of many sides of a coin. Like most players nuance and truth suffers when we want simple answers. "The criminal are inciting violence Guys who can spell out that legal term? "agreed @Sanfran.

2:21:03,2:22:10, Mandela was just a poster boy and sports has more matchfixing that people would care to admit With modern technology of Skype. Zuma can talk to us today from his hospital bed under doctors supervision to help South Africa from his death bed. What patriot would do less? @H A L O sports is an important part of society. It is needed especially in times like this. Stress release. First olympics started in 776BC. Coming from a mom of a little sports star. 😁😁 "Zuma isn't coming "@HALO do you know the power of sport? It's one thing that unites this nation. So don't downplay sport. there's a reason it's now subdued @Valencia J We cannot all eat at the same time you turn will come just be patiant @HALO u are addressing the wrong platform now "All we want to Zuma and his Sonn is the money "if zuma wants DCJ recuse himself 
2:22:30,2:23:27, @Immanuel 🤣🤣🤣 #Triggered "@Aubrey De Bliquy Remember Rajbansi "@mbuso it's people like you that make us never to move forward and prosper. Why can't we sit at the same table and eat together. Why must we eat in phases @Immanuel OMW!! That'll be one heck of a bunfight!! LOL! 😅😅@Immanuel "I said sports are not important now @SanFran Arnold Awesome idea. Bring Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii. Maybe she could inspire our own black Ghandi. This time more than ever needs a powerful inspiring leader of vision. @Emmanuel 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 
2:24:07,2:25:43, here comes Molefe now . Immanuel I'm dead😂😂😂😂😂 @H A L O sports is so much more engaging for the soul than war and conflict and suffering. "Zuma will not even agree to appear before Mogoeng Mogoeng @immanuel that will b fire and petrol my friend . "@H A L O You've got a point. Priorities "@HALO no one else seems to care about us. look how selfish our ""leaders"" are just sorting themselves and their families and children. so let us love ourselves and our needs. we don't need to plz you" Ok KAREN! "@H A L O not selfish for my own personal entertainment 
2:25:50,2:27:11, I don't want to humiliate Zuma more than he does himself. It is sad and embarrassing. "Naledi gets what I'm stating isnt zuma supposed to be here on nov 16? is this not Tokyo Sexwale after plastic surgery??? 🤔 "hands off the RSA former President @zip reeper yes "@zip reeper Yes @HALO you can Karen all you want. Let us also have a point of view. Thanx have a great day @rox its julius malema 
2:27:19,2:28:10, For one thing I detest the ease with which everythjing becomes so racial simply by virtue of something which is by definition only skin deep. A pigment of the imagination. LOL "Ok lady Manelo...you must be joking somewhere somehow this get his share. I just stated a valid point and you people took it personal @Manelo Manelo2 I think his wife needs some surgery after the way he beat her! hahaha @Zip "@Valencia J true leaders lead and look after the members read the amounts I want to hear how much of my tax was used 
2:28:11,2:29:24, "@Naledi Barron Yep "@zip zipper yes but he is having none of it "@Manelo if you want to play Manelo is ajoke Stop perving over Zuma's misfortune. @Naledi Barron On 16 November there will still be court cases/civil war deciding who won the US election. And that will affect the global economy hahahaha @Valencia what are you on about now? @immanuel theyll drag zuma here kicking and screaming @donovan unfortunately we don't have true leaders only a bunch of greedy thieves voted in by stupid voting cattle 
2:29:41,2:30:38, @Rox nothing why? TRUMP VICTORY 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣0️⃣➖2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣4️⃣ I doubt @Zip why insulting voters It's taking the taste out of my coffee and I already can't take sugar because it kills me but I celebrate a country where I can lawfully smoke a doobee and speak the truth without it being a crime. @Manelo Manelo2 Howzit Goat "@Aubrey LOL @Donovan Landsberg !!! @Donovan 😂😂😂😂 
2:30:55,2:32:01, "Some people can't handle it if your opinions don't align with theirs @Valencia J Lol I don't need to spark a dube to speak the truth. @rox that embicile said Zuma did nothing wrong. mxm play nice play fair guys Awesome rhyme sister @Valencia J "okay @Valencia "They lack emotional maturity so you can't actually have a stimulating and meaningful conversation "@Heather Durr Yes 
2:32:41,2:33:47, "@zip zipper true hey 🤔🤔🤔🤔 vasco da gama "@HALO that's you exactly. Can see you won't stop either. I even greeted you on our departing comment to show no hard feeling but eish I love it when you talk dirty @Valencia J You mean Zuma se butternutgat?

2:40:04,2:40:56, point taken Naledi.!ets be factual. let the platform given make us benefit something my first time in here and can see quite interesting engagements. "@wim ek loop alweer. Jy weet Mos ek Kom net in @Jenny Whitewaves 😉 Tax costs in disciplinary hearing? "The devil was also proud of his beauty @Fred Desrosiers that would be correct @Thandekile Sigwela Welcome ! Take a deep breath and dive in 😉 """this is the instruction that was there""" 
2:41:10,2:42:21, @H A L O Wasn't that Narcissus? :buffering::buffering::buffering: Who thinks South Africa is at least a 9 out of the ten best countries they I would love to be in? Women need to be humbled "come in Thandekile Sounds dubious "@ Naledi should this witness receive amnesty? I no longer respect executives in suits and ties they have proven beyond doubt to be spineless and puppets

"political parties only use policies for campaigning @Sherwin Peters I'm beginning to think he's earned amnesty His mic is still off 
2:44:35,2:46:13, thanks chaps. did this guy have the power to refuse to pay if the CFO instructed him to do so another stooge executing illegal instructions "I respectfully request a leave to apologize for my late coming  @Val Speirs You from Standard & Poor?😄 "@Naledi He didn't actually loot @Rox If its like that let me remain with my underpaying and exploiting job as security guard "@Val Speirs Junk Status by the measure of fake @Sherwin Peters Exatly. but I do feel that pressure was on to compromise him in some way! 
2:46:45,2:48:37, Filure would be a choice. I trust those least who stand aound fantacizing about failure and throwing matches. Twisted fate: Abhi and Pragya... Twisted fate 2: and Twisted fate3: Zondo commission.... "@MOLLY PHUNGULA Transnet related testimony from the former General Manager indeed @Daysman that's why u are still here to tell the tales.. Aubrey ..our economy is at an all time low and was before the Chinese communist virus was unleashed. @Naledi he was instructed mos @Sherwin Peters Same thing really. All boils down to personal integrity doesn't it? @Jenny whitewaves no the CFO was his immediate senior i like how the chair is putting Questions to our very own corrupt learders 
2:48:41,2:49:55, Did you see apparently agrizzi bought a house and a luxury car in Italy and there's conversation around him being a flight risk @Val Speirs Please spare me the drooling over Covid19 numbers. 16000 deaths out of 60 million population. Your drool is showing. @Naledi Anog Singh "Val Spears Having a spine is very dangerous in the public sector so his guilt was in not reporting this but to who the minister laughed at him. H coul have resigned but it would not have stopped it or is it Anoj @Rox True dat. Takes 'balls' ! Aubrey ..I am not giving you statistics only a fact. 
2:50:05,2:51:41, Val spears is trumped up @Jenny true that mapoma is a vet who survived the trenches of transnet dismissals and malfeasance @Sherwin Peters Not too sure..... When is K. Hofmeyer coming through? There are 2 dangers for any company. #1 = not having enough money; # 2 = having too much money. All the looters were operating under condition #2 Hahah @zip he deserves veteran grants "The state is claiming that Agrizzi is a flight risk @rox i would be in a nuthouse by now 
2:51:43,2:52:55, "@Rox @ Aubrey..therefore the economy and unemployment in your opinion was at it's worst before the Chinese Communist Virus. These lizzard brained parasites fantasize about being reincarnated as a virus to cull us useless eaters love to leave their trademark 9s and 1s on their handiwork to signal their kind to fall in line. @Paul Buchel yip. apparently bought a house and car in Italy Gama hit the Lotto at Transnet. I would not be surprised if they paid Gama everytime he sneezed. hahaha @Yolo u know All the emotional manipulation so that you can feel powerful is Agrizzi going to be in custody? """sucks""" 
2:53:09,2:54:00, hes descended from vasco de gama from 1497 Ancient veduc scripture states that the highest heaven before Gods dwelling has only men it in after the testimony of adv mapoma heads must roll He is safe in there vedic* "@FieliesSA Let me switch to Agrrizi in court """the wickedness of a women showeth on her face""" Aubrey ..you look like a fake professor of nonsense

"then this H A L O character must be blocked @H A L O Shhhhh now! Let's stick with the reality here. Deal? 
2:58:04,2:59:53, DONE. Aubrey..what has that got to do with our Junk Status?? @H A L O Thank you!! "I don't condone everything that's said here where is @thando tandy "a b c "16000 deaths is no more existential threat than AIDS or the common cold. Nuance is everything and the opposite is a lie in the vein of Bernays Agrizzi cannot be trusted "Everything I stated is fact 
3:00:21,3:03:02, of course they would not have returned the money DCJ is ALWAYS in a hurry to get to lunch 🤧🤧🤧🤧 lunch I am gonna miss you all @Joel Aphane Do you remember the Brett Kebble debacle?
