Shush heksie 🙄 this is one rough lady Liewe Heksie need'nt shout .. DCJ must tell her to tone down a bit !! Heksie must put fingers on the lips and sit quietly thats illegal is it not  
10:58,17:24, "here we go again This is one is too confident just jumps in as if its her family meeting at her house Big increase in house robberies in Johannesburg – these are the areas being hit this is a slime ball flip flip flop Anoj Singh is a slimy snake 🐍🐍🐍🐍 "Anoj: ""I once thought that I had made a mistake laaaaag 😂😂😂😂😂😂 pout while speaking hamba Anoj Singh @Lalitha C heksie 😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂 
18:15,21:22, @Danile its Au Naturale "i am trying to find judicial commission live @S V 1 agree the shouting is ridiculous unless she is deaf herself ... @Eleanor what is it about? @Valencia J u live here...how can i see your profile ?  "@Valencia J 32 judges positionsto be filled "Woodman  @Eleanor oh his being his normal bly self. Why they put him in positions like that is beyond me @Vines? my profile? 
22:05,23:59, @Valencia J yea @Valencia J Zondo sd have disbarred him @Vines not sure @Eleanor did he say that? lied S is for skelem stinky sly singh anoj's MA always wanted him to be a TV star. said he had the looks for it. bet she did not know that he would be the villain "wow. that spierwit stekkie is a walking fossil. must be our incredible health care @Valencia J I am saying so 
24:53,30:18, "@Eleanor oh let him score his political points he is not even a certified CA(SA) anymore "@Valencia J thry all s scared of him. Bully of note @Sanjay Maharaj who is not certified? what was the question 🤔 "looking at Ah-know's tie @Celeste haha yes she could be hard of hearing if you look at the state of her ! where's Adv Seleka "He is such a creep 
30:20,35:21, Komodo's desk lamps are new. probably brought in to shed some light... So if government obstructs a medicine that prevents Covid death have they not killed 3 times as many as covid? @Danile Ngubenyathi can't see Seleka seems to me that McKinsey was paid for not doing a proper job. neither did they fix Eskom nor did they kill it dead. not a proper job at all. Singh is spinning DCJ in his web !!! "ahah Time spent telling a letter of acceptance Dec 2015 was binding agreement. Now says there was no agreement in June 2016 because the SLA was not signed per Dr Weiss or it may have been signed in Jan yooooh this woman is loud and irritating 🙉 @Woodman I even forgot that is an EL 
35:47,38:59, I see many unemployed Indians on this forum. why is that? yes seleka "@Sanjay Maharaj McKinsey occupied an entire floor for green bank something is not right to this lawyer of Mr Singh. "@eleanor @Eleanor Woodman Was it not Accenture? slow p Put her in the Sun for a few hours Bushiri lawyer again 
39:01,43:05, "@Sanjay Maharaj and just before Mckinsey scandal broke green bank quickly employed on of them permanently Accenture??? what a bunch of yahoos. they were born out of the disgrace Arthur Anderson.... the CEs of these large organizations tagt pay for these consultants must be hanged by their toes. "@Mangalani Mangalani they all ""helped"" the green bank "The ""letter of acceptance"" would have been the agreement on which they commenced work" "@eleanor @Sanjay Maharaj Managers are instructed to work with these fraudsters since Executives have accepted kickbacks. Yup "@mangalani "@Sanjay Maharaj @Mangalani Mangalani yes 
45:41,47:57, You are correct DCJ Seleka has been getting paid for doing almost nothing in the last couple of weeks anoj no matter how many tyms u wrap urself up in a chappie wrapper u still a chappie to be spat out after uve been chewed start speaking the truth plz nd stop confusing everything DCJ STOP IT. You have no idea what happened -follow the evidence for God's sake who is watching judge selection Funny that no one talks abt Brian Dames. He got McKinsey into Eskom & left to join McKinsey thereafter. Singh is now playing with semantics - trying to be clever "he keeps referring to ""her"" when he talks who love to know who he is referring too" I agree Heather. I am so frustrated. 
48:23,50:58, "Anoj im beyond frustration with this.... "how did that chair become a ""Mr""? surely with that wide bottom Dr Weiss believed the unsigned SLA was inaction Jan 2018 because there was a acceptance letter in place and work was done on that so back dating it was only dating it to the date it was in action I'ts time Chair let's Seleka do his job jirrie he's allowing Singh to run the commission ! Jan 2016 "@roza I am waiting for a question or evidence to nail him. Chair. ..cool it 
51:20,53:52, Chair is confusing the whole matter..... seems to me that Komodo has given up on coconut and his apprehensions of being an evidence leader. about time too Contracts 101 Sanjay hes a chappie nd irritates the heck out of me Seleka is trying to stop Chair but he is not listening DCJ must let the process follow its course - he has now confused himself sanjay hes cheeky nd shud grow up 2 Pardo me. it was curious George who was a monkey. chappie was a lion. What is this? No one is going to get arrested. what's the point.  
53:55,55:54, let anybody call dali for me :goodvibes: :buffering: anoj is gonna walk happy birthday Msholozi uKhule Nxamalala "Anoj happy birthday hhaw thanks for reminding us. akhule umholi. the greatest leader of all times it was used last time only one signature but Anogh dix Shut the F.............. up!!!!

58:43,1:02:29, The commissioner of oath could not have signed the affidavt without signature Correct DCJ @ fuzile dadazana seconded "@roza But there was not an MSA in place at the time @Diane Louw what did i miss... still at the letters His meshing an SLA with and MSA is NOT correct and is smoke and mirrors we now have a pastor who farts on congregants to bless them lol @Alta we at the stage where the DCJ is confusing...

This is the attitude we want in this Commission. help me is this about the R6b paid before signing the contract? what's seleka getting paid for in today's session? I think he must give a quarter to the chair. he's doing most of his graft @ALTA Glad nie. ek spring maar so tussen die kommissie en die krieket. kan nie besluit watter is meer vervelig nie "@moonchild Ja ja ja ja ja ja -dont try so hard you bloody turtle on a broom stick. The only one who can follow this argument is DCJ and even then he is not following it @Elizabeth Jooste true

It never ends "Paul "@code @Lorna Kavanagh far to aptient gotcha Pastor anoj not gonna get arrested 
1:19:35,1:20:28, @Eleanor Woodman it's driving me insane. and he still wants to highlight small page errors. Mr Seleka is also getting annoyed and trying not to show it😂😂😂 @Lorna Kavanagh patient I mean This is going way to slowly...Seleka is far to meek for this shark Ei @Moonchild - DCJ is like that rich educated uncle that runs family meetings and no decision gets taken if he’s not there  @Roza E It will happen very soon. "a crowd of people came to stare "@Abongile Xhantini yes @SanFran Arnold i do agree with you I appreciate Zondo's proffessionalism and knowledge BUT a nasty judge that takes no crap and hates corruption is what we needed !! 
1:20:32,1:21:57, Ah-know is a pastor??? no way! this madhir is the sort that would have stolen Jesus's last supper. "@Lerato Moleke - ha ha 🙂 it appears so Go on Zondo.

1:28:50,1:30:30, I wish Mr Seleka would wipe that smug look off his face!!! now he's fudging @Louis C within the sounds of silence. And all the people bowed and prayed to the neon gods they made ..... "A noj is smart The words of the prophets are written on the subway wallsand tenement halls @Louis C  even his SC said the agreement was signed in January Anoj is Guilty but it's going to be hard to prove beyond reasonable doubt because of the lack of oversight at Eskom. It's easy for him to pin on someone who was not doing their job. @HeatherDurr in the words of@SanFran Arnold Bi: rather late than pregnant "Singh has been trying to recreate facts on the go depending on the proposition put to him
