32:15,32:49, ANC has been a failure disgrace and a criminal organization to destroy the country "Valencia wow! @ ? alta vetdoos I can also come legally protest right outside your house for no reason Standing outside a school is peacefull ANC = a knife in the back of the Dalai Lama and.......Tutu Let’s see how much you like it 
33:10,34:09, @Phakamile Khuzwayo yes i see ure on the chat since last week on a regular basis That protest was a racist stunt and completely unnecessary ANC = crime syndicate Lets see if CR is actually serious about fixing this. Corruption is a cancer that eats at the sould of a country. @Smart Guys thank you for your disgusting comment @Mzala yes my favourite comrade we see u too welcome We will no longer have no-go areas in this country. Im not keen on EFF but they can do what they want if its peaceful and not really inhibiting anyone going about their business the matric farewell was a private function and not the school. 
34:16,34:55, I agree with that part as a general rule that should always exist disgusting indeed!!! Brackenfell residents overreacted completely @Goran Djocik Is Brackenfell a no-go area for people like them? ANC = Charlie in the Chocolate factory @ALTA I just nticed his crude comment which reflects poorly on him not you sis. "@Aubrey de Bliquy @Tommygun GM eff only wanted to cos problems everywhere 
35:05,36:01, ANC = all animals are equal but.........fat bellies for the pigs "@ Mzala they only have hatred built in them @ALTA GM again! @Goran the issue the guys had was teachers supporting those functions. Schools should not participate in such things. they dont know what peace is all about The EFF has brought out th tr Right.. let’s come protest right outside your house and see if you still agree with what you just said ANC built nothing but mas graves 
36:04,36:59, @Mfundo Some are yearning for the passbooks that limited our movements Dudu Myeni wat did Zondo say about her today coz today is the day for tht criminal Which South African spells cause as 'cos'?. Must be foreign bots. But the fellow is tall shame!! "If I throw a party Aubrey wow his comment was disgusting my word he's got no manners at all ... @Pastor i think a prayer is needed for that horrible person @Kevin the coolest. The parents complained to EEF about the racism at the school. that was reason they went there ANC killed Chris Hani eff is searching where it can grab attention after losing face from covid-19. 
37:15,37:49, "Some of the EFF demands accompanying the protest were crazy "alta Agreed thokozani "Had there been no teachers there "Mr. Mzala is absolutely right!!!The problem I have Is today's session that boring to an extent where you guys are discussing about what happened at Brackenfell ANC = boy Malema 'protecting the institutions' "@Mzala @Mzala no that not what I said. i said they had no business to go there.

41:58,42:42, ANC = Racism EFF released a statement saying they will visit Brackenfell just like Senegal "Khuzwayo You are right @Rene Ngwenya @Phaka sad you dont see how the 2 are interlinked "@Phakamile Khuzwayo spot on @ Johan lol not sure what you referring to @Peter Lucas. Die ouers het ge complain by die EEF van racism by die skool. dit was rede hoekom hulle da gegaan dit "something happend and Its racist

46:00,46:50, "@Thanda Sibisi former Denel Group Chief Financial officer @Tommygun I think what many whites dont understand is that our black population would rather vote for a black gov with a history of corruption rather than a White who represents horror of apartheid "@Sean true we don't need eff unemployed hooligans to fight our battles Whoa!!! A whole lot of stuff happening here. And I LURVE the jacket today!!! What happened yesterday just shows that coloured are against blacks. @zip reeper ek eet nie pruime nie is sleg maar n mango ja @Mfundo There is nothing that you can say to convince someone like sergio. @ Peter Lucas Enca het ouer ge interview

47:46,48:54, @Heather Durr I could be wrong but I suspect some voters think that aprtheid could come back with a white government. "@Louis C We might not always agree with how the EFF does things but what I saw and heard there was driven by the attitude and belief that they had no right to be there. More@ALTA I heard there was a PRIVATE party held for about 40 matric pupils by their parents ..the school has a total of about 240 matriculants..how can that be racism? ??? "louis ANC = Plagiate is the new 'science' @ pucci.The teachers were divisive when they chose to attend the private event. It's just doesn't set things right to the classroom. Hence the violence yesterday @Mfundo What does duhhh mean? 
49:02,50:26, Coloureds are siding with racist DA😑 We can not have no-go areas in our country. @minnie @Naledi Barron heya @ Minnib prince. why didn't they include the other 200 students? Die mannetjie het n grand suit aan! Coloureds are sell out. eff leaders mustn't play with our minds bcs they drink coffee with the same ppl they claim they are against them 😡 @Sean dont generalize. 
50:33,51:29, @Minnib it's the same if you have a private party at your house. Surely you can invite who ever you want to. it's not an open street party @Louis C voel jy beter vanmore Lol but that boer that moered EFF members 😆😆😆😆 steihoff money is not our money ppl must stop this thing of mixing issues ANC = African National Corruption "@Louis C "@Sean You are a idiotic EFF member Theres clearly some kind of issue at the Brackenfell school for the EFF to elicit such an aggressive response. Looked like there were only 10 or so EFFers. An example of coloureds being sell outs is Trevor Noah. 
51:37,52:08, was tht a private party for white students only In a school tht have all colour come on guys eff was doing a right thing there @Doubell ?? no idea maybe they only invited close friends? ? where's Adv. Hofmeyer rer ANC = Hospitals turning into shiiiiitholes @ALTA Hey hey!!!!!
