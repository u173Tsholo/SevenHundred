37:06,39:32, already about 50million has been spent on security 4 this How can this commission be a factional tool against Zuma when he himself has proclaimed it? General Ace is not going anywhere there you are dividing the Anc... Thiza... Zuma was always the Commander in THIEF....even from the early 70's yoh yoh yoh... He still is...
