54:18,56:24, Nobody in politics can be trusted How do y'all live under conditions such as load shedding? Bona die man The reason the ANC have not changed the people on the list is because younger smart people will come in and see all the corruption that's ongoing. Why did he not respond honestly? this guy is playing with us coz he was born to lie How can we trust now that his telling the truth? Easy way is back way.Viva Nene 
56:52,59:58, Lies and denials...The EFF wants everyone to believe they are squeaky clean The ANC is rotten to the core South Africans NOT forgiving? Forgive what? The whole ANC is corrupt. Has been from beginning. Why forgive? Future generations will judge the past 25 years as totally wasted starting with the arms deal So who tells the complete truth in SA Nene read!!! @Monique...Nobody it seems @Thando Nkutha whose this????

Excuses...being polite to the Guptas! Eish! He is only messing himself up He is not telling the truth Once a politician always a politician. He is like Bester now

They ask Nene how many times did he visit the Gupta. that was one of the question. He was just polite to Zuma as he respects them because they were his boss friend 
1:18:43,1:19:43, Athi wt do we need to do.?? Did I miss anything? I had to put out the trash. BETO2020 USA I really feel for Judge Zondo...I pray that he continue with strength he has already been exposed "liar I don't seem to understand Nene's argument about being accessible cos he could be accessible in his office and not to go out of the office to see the Guptas at Saxonwold or anybody for that matter. LIARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR @Monique’s Makeup just Nene saying he stopped seeing Guptas not because it was wrong but he was scared of getting caught
