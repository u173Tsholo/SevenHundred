All Gupta consultants involved in State captures South Africa has an independent judiciary so arrests and prosecutions that are based on emotions do not cut it. You need evidence that can stand scrutiny in a court of law. Since this enquirer started on all the previous facts of previously cases. No arrests? Please heed @Anne M.
