"😂😂😃😃 hey these guys they don’t play tjoo @ Derek main 
40:04,44:50, "kuzoba lit @makhosi nobhatyi I don't blame them - people have already been killed for exposing corruption in FS. It's been run by a true gangster for years now. It was very nice when they were doing corruption but now it's very difficult to substantiate what they have done with the taxpayers millions. this lady is beatin around d bush. answering things with confusion. no oversight "I am praying NPA Exactly @ Diana Sekatane "@Diana Sekatane​ im glad this advocate is dealing with this Estina issue..she is So On Point and Chairperson flows well with her @Paul collectively yes... 
45:04,51:23, "Makhosi We want all thugs to go to jail doesn’t matter how big you are @makhosi nobhatyi I'd rather they take their time and get it right instead of having the cases thrown out of court for lack of evidence or bad investigation. @ Jabu let's have a bit of patience the puzzle will unravel itself. "@Derek Main​ Investigators must be under raps because this fightback will be dealing with them. "@I Am Free "@ Heather Cotton I don’t worry much about them sitting there at ANC headquarters but we will get them "@Jabu Malinga I stand to be corrected 
51:55,54:52, "Anne "@Anne M True @Anne no.. this advocate knows her story very well "The NPA has put in an extradition request @Diana Sekatane What prompted the States to take action? is the grin on miss Rothman's face nerves related or what? @Anne remember USA is acting as the police of the world Where is Agrizzi? 
56:05,1:20:58, Remember those who worked for these people senior and investigators are still inside the department so first clean inside then run trials this dairy project is a headache "@Diana Sekatane Yes they are why USA didn't close ranks on steinhoff if their serious about fighting all corruption @Anne the capture was everywhere especially the law enforcement. and Eskom scared of implicating herself? lol Definitelly scared of implicating herself 
1:21:32,1:33:47, haha yeah Magashula's queen bean curry Even Zondo questioned her about the way she drafted her affidavit. She didnt talk about crititical things that happened when she was in that dept Zondo! Jump in! Zondo afrikaans pls Nowonder Duduzane is doing business with whom coz I believe they were targeting government now his dad is out "yeah 
1:34:26,1:39:04, "zondo your sound quality is fading when truth is been told ......She knows nothing about what a cattle-farm consist of and was placed in that position to effect an illicit cash flow. The ride should have been nice at the taxpayers' expense. Looks like she ate all the cows from Vrede "education and health mambo ni motto lol dudu zuma gave jonas a lift from the hotel to guptas res.jonas security was bypassed.after meeting dudu walked Jonas outside to give him a lift.dudu offered lift to the airport or cowtrain. why did dudu nt give him a lift back to the hotel to his security. surprising. and somewhere in between Jonas got offered R600mil 
1:40:02,1:48:58, of our money "USA are stricter on the Guptas than our ""ANC"" government is" yeah it's about time someone does something about them lol hopefully UK will follow and UAE? Let's hope they do more than this lady did "and ICC should nail them UAE yeeeah lol "...I have the best excuses and if you pay me  
1:52:10,2:02:11, hi I'm new let's play roblox THIS STATE CAPTURE IS BULL This woman has that stealing and crook vibes under those glasses LOL Sthakati wth iyo my white friends our quet today y ? "corruption knows no colour She is lying now 
2:02:17,2:06:58, she had been doing well @Diana Sekatane I agree - corruption knows no colour. The guilty must face the consequences. couse if is black on stand yerrrrrr i read lots coment and something like that 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 @Phill Rambau I'll take a guess that she is an ANC member. @i am free what are trying to say? @victor she's been lying all day long Derek ooh ok "@Carnoth Ngomane I have not believed her either It was clear that she was corrupt the minute she said that the New Age subscription by FS government was above board. 
2:07:04,2:12:00, "@i am free numbers don't lie @Norman Zwane the truth is something they are prepared to take to their graves ...Corrupted minds consider themselves as what someone suggest they are and form groups of separated ethnicity. This is the psychology for controlling the masses. Those who are found to be wanting must face the full might of the law period. this lady she's clever she always smiling and saying nothing believe me she taste curry big time 😁 @Diana Sekatane what money was owing? Does Apartheid era gov corruption excuse ANC corruption ...? thanks - how silly The was money owed by the S. A government under apartheid which was to be serviced by the democratic government. 
2:12:14,2:14:57, There is no denying that there was corruption under the Nat government but the ANC have taken it to an entirely new level. They have perfected corruption. what for power stations and railways? One so blind that don’t want to see Corruption @lady bird no. They have Derek "Diana you could have fooled me  😁 her eyes are burning shame "@Derek Main In my other life I use to run a business. I often found that after sacking one of my key managers "Ms Rockman will be heading straight to the pub after this session of questioning 
2:14:57,2:21:55, corruption corruption to the ANC they taking SA to the drein LOL Easy D how can this gupta's boys fool so many people huh ? look at her mmmmmmmm premier coach her nice today lol @lady bird fooled you how? This lady has been put through the ringer and I think has come out pretty well unscathed. It's a pity others who have been here have not been interrogated so thoroughly. DIANA the here and now is what is important . VERY important "@David Tuer I don't think she's come out clean. Seems like she just shirked her responsibilities. If she was part of treasury with oversight Who said is not important... These number are insane 
2:22:49,2:25:15, "@I am Free Let us hope so. Derek Diana than that must be the focus . Anything that takes the focus of this corruption is dangerous .Your discussion can be had seperately corruption is as old as humankind. "i think she is scared of the death threat Diana and now what .... y everyone is dealing with millions not thousands someone needs to pen down memoirs about this whole corruption of state capture and even include the scripts.I will buy the whole set of books. HUNDREDS of millions Lady T nobody is that boring 
2:25:39,2:34:46, @David Tuer Of course - deal with all the guilty. From what I've heard she did the barest minimum (and maybe not even that). @David Tuer She had a responsibility to flag any indications that money was not being used for the intended purpose and didn't. @Frans Phala I would be scared if I was her - Mr 10% is a gangster thug. "Derek Main. If your take is the right one "We have yet to assertain if she is corrupt  absolutely right @ Lady bird.. @David Tuer I can't argue with that but that's very close to the argument that we should first deal with apartheid corruption before we worry about current corruption. aha Derek All the guilty have to be punished. 
2:34:49,2:39:34, this is just my theory but i think she knows something about Vrede Dairy farm killings Derek Main. Not really. I'm saying chop off the head of the snake. @David Tuer Well hopefully we'll make sushi of the snake. I will only have faith in these proceedings if Zuma and Duduzane go to jail SNAKE SHUSHI .... even sushi eeew @Lady Bird I have to agree with that. The proof of the success will be the number of people going to jail. It can't just be another Seriti commission. Yes Derek Commission upon Commission ...no jail . Wasting money "@Tholithemba Ntsele Yes - you're right but if people don't go to jail
