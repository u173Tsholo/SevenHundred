2:18:31,2:20:44, @magda the ANC is a organization gavern by the constitution. an like EFF. These politicians are stealing because the slave trades with the west @YouTube Channel and the SLAVE TRADE TO MUSLIM /ARAB countries the same time They cannot read the constitution they would not understand a word of it 🤣🤣 @Cameron Kim Yes but you as a wise mind also fight with your people "@Seguin. . instead of punching holes in manifestos "@Cameron Kim Coffee tea @Peter Sant I am talking about the population holding their office bearers accountable...they are succeeding in making SA a failed state @YouTube Channel lol I state facts - fight nobody \ 
2:20:48,2:21:47, if we can vote ANC out. that can be a big mistake. @YouTube Channel colonial powers funded by the City of London. peter correct "Talk is cheap. People make allegations against the people we love or loathe. It'd be interesting if all these allegations are ""Fire Proof"" from the court of law." @Cameron Kim I understand you state facts..but not everybody does #Moshoeu Mabusela ... You failed to include The African National Corruption! A little birdie whispered in my ear ... Squirrel has millions in TakeAlot AND Naspers ... of interest ... TakeAlot RMB? askaris want to change the ANC electoral list because the realise the BRANCHES picked pro JZ cadres and not picked by Bidvest The current government should be declared illegal due to criminal intent @YouTube Channel I dont care 
2:21:48,2:23:05, Anyone voting ANC is happy with the status quo which is wholesale theft of state resources It would of been great if the ICT Hub and City of tomorrow where built. So many jobs would of been created wt I am saying let's give them last chance. Another chance to steal? @YouTube Channel some blacks found out that the ANC was a Jew?Zionist creation the last fwe days @Cameron Kim Yep..London and all royals across the globe Why would South Africa be different to any other failed state in Africa... unfortunately it will become a failed state it is predictable. "The LAST CHANCE ... to finally FINISH SOUTH AFRICA OFF Magda u have choice.i will vote ANC. is not a secret. 
2:23:10,2:24:03, @YouTube Channel I dont think the Royals - Tribal Kings_ in SA are part of it Split former TG Holomisa himself has been dining at Saxonworld. He was my last hope. SAY YES to Corruption HAHAHA @Cameron Kim If you wanna change something you should care about your brother and sister understanding you "now they are sabotaging the GOVERNMENT so that we can vote out of anger "People didn’t being in curiosity any decision that was made The ANC can't have another chance to steal even more... get rid of them while there is still at least some hope @Luvuyo Zantsi open your eyes - and lok it up for yourself . 
2:24:07,2:25:31, But I will be happy to c bra Ace out of the ANC If we vote the ANC then clearly the problem are the citizens and not the organisation. Blind Loyalty only leads to a cliff. Logic clears that ANC is Fatigued @Cameron Kim Tribal kings??

"In military science This gentleman may not be as charismatic as Agrizzi but I'm fascinated by his narration. 
2:28:25,2:29:20, ANC is a product of colonial poison on African people. so white media coined the Guptas house as a compound Peter Malema must come to Mr Zondo. Cyril is just ONE man against a criminal faction in the NEC so we all have compounds not houses "😀😀😀they didn't trust you. watching this from Dubai @Thulani Bukani THE ANC WAS FAKE FROM DAY ONE - problem with these witnesses is that they are spilling beans but hide their involvements 
2:29:23,2:30:48, They dont want to be recoderd Maybe Cyril will be gone after the elections if the implicated state captured has their way Clever mafia😂😂 "are our leaders so stupid such that they would be asked to hand over their cellphone And the curry? its known GodZille was frequenting with the Guptas at Sahara Oval but WHY is the premier called to the StateCaptureCom?? Can someone help me "All corrupt elements in the ANC must be jailed. Period. that is why we need to vote for ANC. EFF still has to steal """They"" always take them to "" a room""" Mabusela correct

"Funicanz "Too often we have heard witnesses state they did this or that "From the time ANC big guys were chilling in exile 
2:32:14,2:33:04, "This ""room"" thing is a problem." Ty the integrity cannot stop people from commiting crime. Walls are closing in on all the ANC thugs. Thanks to the Commission. @Cameron Kim Stay wise.. lead your people without emotion..thanks @Ty Bosch the ANC 'integrity committee is an oxymoron @Luvuyo talking to your comrades at branch meetings is not teaching. Very naive of him to just hand over his phone @YOUTUBE I lead nobody Wt can u do with 18m.buy a flat??.no no no 
2:33:08,2:34:26, "I want to know how Ace is going to deny the ""allegations""" @Cameron Kim there's no change then @Thulani Bukani 😄 yes witness speak into the mike you are famous man Magashule is the worst of the bunch!

And he even said there is different between commission and court. @Peter Sant right now I don't see only a handful of honest one's against a mass of thieves I know Cris Hani was ready to fight. Your top guys were setting up ANC branches overseas while people were struggling in SA. Your guys had no appetite to come and fight with Winnie. 
2:35:43,2:37:12, Jacob's u dint ask a mafia anything's @Robert Russell 🤣 Go to Mexico Everyone that has been to the GUPTA compound should be Jailed for Treason Treason I am Russia already will get my residence in 3 years Ace Magashule sold our country to Guptas yes Zuma was the dumbest President ever oh but clever enough to enrich himself and his closest comrades with Gavin Thompson as his chief whip. @Ty Bosch i WOULD say yes if you say YES to anyone visits Ruperts / Oppenheimers etc as well 
2:37:13,2:38:09, Tulani stop trying to be clever cause Chris was not above the ANC he was a part of collective and he understood the role of exiled Cadres "@mbuyiso may you are right Afika dint go there these pple should be put behind bars and some are even lying under oath magda the codesa negotiator is here to liberate our country cr Oh please Afika YouTube Channel we are not hating just extremely traumatised and angry that the soul of our country was sold to the highest bidder...our tax money blood and sweat was looted in front of our very eyes What was the ANC through Magashula in Venezuela to learn about a desytroyed economy Ty stop it cause this is not a banana republic 
2:38:51,2:39:49, @Dumile Mateza that is why SA sent doctors for training to Cuba - must study how not to be a docter "this is very dangerous. is this man "Why do you spell Africa with a""K"" just curious!?"

It is a European name Alex is in trouble due to ANC neglect now they are using people in a political ploy...the ANC stooped so low it is pathetic @funicanz. Very well @ Wallace Mandimutsira I think they forged his signature So please explain where you well done DCJ. I salute how astute this judge is Magda Seguin don't lie its that moron Mashaba @mbuyiso may horseshit

How do you think we can achieve that? this fellow is exposing himself to so many lawsuits now. all contracts he turned down are now being reviewed @MagdaSeguin it is not negligence. There was a fund by National Governemnt for the renewal of Alex. Thos money dissappeared now they are orchestrating this protest @Afika Centane yes take no responsibility i have just received inf from nec that black persons who wishes to emigrate will be put on the bee system to assist the previously disadvantged people ...after all the skelms will be gone we start new Magda I am not that Mashaba has failed Did you know that SA has the 10th biggest road network in the world.... and needs 100 Bn for maintenance as this has been neglected for the past 25 years.... the ANC can only steal things or beak them 
2:46:51,2:48:25, I often rode through Alex...have you been there yet? NB no mpimpi.s will be allowed AKKRA means Ants and it is a region in Ghana. I have just researched it. this is free lesson for law students.

This judge is brilliant. @Val Speirs research is the generation of new knowledge. google doesn't do that Is a Spatula something you use to turn a fried egg with? @Robert Russell and the Apartheid SA build that while under sanctions -bigl achievement . Since the ANC with all the support in the world could only steal Mashaba invited CR to go with him to go to Alex...I saw it on Twitter but dololo from CR "@AfikaCentane bendifuna uphawule ngala vesi ka Lizalis'iding lakho whihc by the way nearly became the ANC anthem if Mweli Skota had his way.
