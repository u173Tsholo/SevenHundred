29:37,37:19, "As long as the ANC is the governing party Rubin Naidoo that group of people declared government as their THING like alcapone mafia Cosa nostra (it's our thing) "It is this culture of ""not naming names"" that got us here in the first place." Close this thing. We are busy with COVID-19 now. look at what is happening in our country no jobs plus the pandemic that needs a lot money that is in few people's pocket. Norman Zwane true name and shame @Inam I guess we have other pressing priorities now. I share your sentiment.

48:04,1:00:09, @Pastor J thank you for your service @Pastor J being a pastor if you are one Lucky ran this SOE like his own spaza shop. who were the owners of the companies I am also curious about that. When is Dudu Myeni's judgement to be handed down? "Montana must come to the commission and answer for himself He threatened to come and reveal things but later changed his mind and said he is not coming because the commission wants to temper with his evidence. 
1:02:05,1:10:13, i guess his handlers advised him against coming He will talk himself into jail. wil he be ever jailed For a couple of months he tweeted about being busy preparing a statement and he said that will expose many people. It was disappointing when he said he is no longer pursuing that. The commission must just issue summons to him. "@Mzalwane Mzala do you by any chance know where this Montana is He is no longer working for government That's better he was a cancer at prasa I think he is still a cancer where he is 
1:13:53,1:28:57, dudu myeni a real Alcaponiüëéüëé why stop talking keep lying A lying corrupt thief. @martha.....did you mean Al Capone? Soni must sit down and rest Eish! I hear that damning evidence is coming out at this commission but the key question is this: Will there be consequences at the end of this? It all depends on the Public Protector and the hawks to take these matters to court A magistrate was suspended based on the evidence presented in this commission. Consequence. sound
