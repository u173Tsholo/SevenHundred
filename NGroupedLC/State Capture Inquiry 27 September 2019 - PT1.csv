Your last statement is so very true. Sadly money has also become an enslaver to those that now serve in Ministry as well. I train and mentor new Pastors now in my retirement. I insist on training those that will serve for the love of the Lord rather than the money.@I Am Free 
2:00:07,2:09:26, The Witness is emotional because of the hardship of working yourself up to the top and corrupt people try to take the meaning of your struggle away to benefit their greed and Tarnish your Reputation. who's the witness? @Luxolo T.D Todolo Very well said "@luxolo Hi guys please update me who is this guy and who is he implicating???????????

3:15:52,3:21:43, @DJ DJ you see the institution bare all legal burden borne by the employees in the link what institution bares all cost for the employee in the end it's the Tax payers that pay for the peoples wrong doing. and unless the state goes after the corrupt to get back the money you and I and your family pay.
