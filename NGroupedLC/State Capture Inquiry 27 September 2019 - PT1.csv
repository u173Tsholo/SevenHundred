Your last statement is so very true. Sadly money has also become an enslaver to those that now serve in Ministry as well. I train and mentor new Pastors now in my retirement. I insist on training those that will serve for the love of the Lord rather than the money.@I Am Free 
2:00:07,2:09:26, The Witness is emotional because of the hardship of working yourself up to the top and corrupt people try to take the meaning of your struggle away to benefit their greed and Tarnish your Reputation. who's the witness? @Luxolo T.D Todolo Very well said "@luxolo Hi guys please update me who is this guy and who is he implicating???????????
