18:28,21:41, Morning @Thando Nkutha 😁😁😁 @Thando Nkutha 😆😆 😂😂😂😂 It's like having 30 Years of Robert Mugabe a disaster Can we stop insulting people its Monday because Verwoerd will never come back again a pity 😂😂😂😂 This question was not answered---A question was asked about who was supposed to win 
21:58,23:37, guys why this witness was not asked about her education background please balance me? Most are not educated or qualified. im surprice tooo @Bongani Ntuli not necessary because she has her own business and not working for a state entity i guess.. What is Ms Viljoen testifying about? They are professionals in looting taxpayers money Who is she? she's too light to be asked Fox "the sound engineer is still on weekend 
24:59,34:41, Sound engineer panicking that SABC pay wages this month full here again? sickening 👹 Yes this chat site has been hacked by the Chinese 😈 This witness is so playful. How many pages is her affidavit? Miss Viljoen @Luvuyo Zantsi My heart is sore because we have a bunch of thieves running our country for their own benefit. Only the ANC fools couldn't see it. Abel wait for the other boot to fall She is young beautiful and not that smart. @carnoth ngomane I have no choice but to wait for the next elections but I'll rub every ANC voters face in it whenever the ANC stuffs up. They always do. 
34:49,37:20, @Thando Nkutha waiting foe that as well As I suspected that she is not that smart. she is lying..everything!!! kwashuba manje🤣🤣🤣 @Derek thats the least you can do A smart business owner would not involve themselves in unethical practices and corruption Uyabuza manje Words are important in legal matters Lisela eli. 
37:30,41:03, thanks @FElix Muyoba for explanaition @Thando Nkutha the liquidators @carnoth ngomane And I intend to do it. So no ANC voter must cry and say wait for 5 years when I do it. I have every right to call out these criminals. Eish who were those liquidators? she is nervous.. Everyone knows you keep records for 5 years "Can the Camera person get the focus on the Miss Hofmeyer camera set @Derek while doing that dont forget to recruit more voters otherwise you will wait for more years 
42:05,44:26, this lady was involved in money laundering or her business was used as a money laundering entity.. This advocate is kwaai This witness is not reliable that is why her business was apparently a money remitter (whatever that is).. @Born Free which business did she own? @carnoth ngomane Everything the ANC touches turns to s**t. It sounds as though she owned a cash in transit business she is on the brink of crying and she will certainly cry if queezed a lot.. NOT A RELIABLE WITNESS 
44:31,46:20, Why did she go for this business in the first place? She can’t recall anything Agreed ANC policy #1 Keep them stupid at the polls @Derek Main to stay in power This witness reminds me of Manyi who started with confidence and ended up with a wimp doesn't make sense The previous witness has implicated her and the Investigator @Derek just put up with that s****t for five year and come up with a strtegy to oust them Hahaha Mzala a female version of Manyi😋😋 but she is always smiling.. 
46:27,51:03, 😂😂😂😂😂Mzala The smile has dissapeared @sanele songelwa @carnoth ngomane My strategy would be that all the criminals be charged and sent to jail. That should get rid of most of the ANC officials. Corrupt to the core. "Still waiting which Engel party I am also waiting @Thami Ngwenya Thats why they keep lowering the pass rate to help keep the unemployed depended on state grants... @Derek Main this lady was used i can sense it.. Andries is like Brian van Wyk She is not wise 
51:51,55:21, she was trying to make a living.. "Russel and Derek She had a job @Born free yeah but someone swindled her to leave that job and establish another one.. Derek only comes for political propaganda and nothing else. Just observe his behaviour. @Derek Main Hey we have a ANC voter in our midst.. 😃 😃 half a billion? II would be suspicious if someone came to me with such a prospect some crooks could just tell her that we want to move this money to that client and we will give this cut then she agrees..thats what her business was doing.. 
56:20,58:14, "That's money laundering CIT companies do not know what amounts are carried by the drivers. There lady b4 this one She's getting scared now In the UK parents were recently convicted for giving money to their child who was part of Isis @Abel Matshidiso Always - DCJ is a legend hi "This women had free everything financing She stole existing clients 
58:30,59:36, Yhoo Huh! It's her CC but she didn't have a job title..how odd This woman is full of lies Morning Magda..... 500 MILLION per month mhhhh! "🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 @Yolo More This is all about the ANC's criminality - how's that not politics? I think like Babadi she allowed herself to be used. 
1:00:32,1:01:39, The Guptas opened up a host of shelf companies in Dubai too same as in SA for money laundering No KPA at all is anyone seeing the yellowbone at the back with glasses? @Thapelo Motabogi imagine if it was you (a comrade) doing that..all sorts of names you will be labeled "@Mzalwane she must have known what she was doing hahaha wooooow this is insane feeling inside of you that everything is ok 😂😂😂😂 true 
1:01:46,1:02:52, Yellow bone is a derogatory term R500 mil for a feeling "and she never kept records @Menzi Mbatha . Gut feeling Agree with you Magda "Afetr Babadi The ANCs involvement in crime is mind blowing. Ramaphosa and his ANC campaign in under investigation by the PP. Investigating where their funds come from. "No business acumen Derek that we all know and no one denies it. Will you then let us focus on the witness for now. 
1:03:15,1:04:40, lool "@Born free Yeah - so much for the ""New Dawn"" - what a farce. It's just the same as before - same criminals in charge." YOLO you can focus on on the witness and not look at the live chat. it's simple This lady did not comply with Fica laws at all this clearly points how corrupt she colluded with his clients. Not even bothering where the funds were coming from Or just block me if you don't want to see what I type. Who is this witness? It's not on the Commission website. Couldn't watch from the start. "she looks young She is trying to charm the DCJ she is also a criminal..how can she just accept money without asking where the money is coming from.. 
1:04:55,1:06:27, Too young and gullible yoh the young lady behind the presenter is so happy! She is like keeeeeep digging hmmm... 🤔 🙈🙉🙊 FICA compliant ?? Born Free there are comments in the live chat that are educating. Thanks @Thando Nkutha . Supplier to SAA or SA Express? YOLO yours is not Anne Viljoen Corruption 
1:07:23,1:09:29, "PLEASE PLEASE Born Free that is how I want to see those that are. She copied the business model of the cash in transit company she worked for before why is this woman so vague? it's like she's trying by all means to say as little as possible the business model was wrong YOLO you can't tell people what they must comment on. how do u block this arab person? "Derek Main this lady i think she is involved in cash and transit robbery 
1:09:36,1:10:11, cut off his head 🤣 Ordering money 5 million 😳😳😳 "Report them and then block them @Thapelo Motabogi 😂😂😂😂😂😂 "where does she get the money from 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Where does this witness come from She said herself that she copied the business model of her former employer zondo is also lost 
1:10:16,1:11:47, DCJ must allow her to move on and come back to it There is clarity! Did they have a regular parking bay at ANC HQ ?? Year now its clear hard cash🥵 "Born Free I said 'will you please' what does she get in return? "I was thinking of funds coming from CIT but it needs to be proven "I'd rather not have SAA 
1:12:21,1:13:42, Yoh! 100 calls a day! Zondo commission is never ending. That's the goal is there a resturant where people order money "Cosmopolitan Green Ecology is the way to go @Mark Dijon Word ! u said it "Derek YOLO what do you you not understand. You can block me @Yolo More Your non-response speaks volumes. Thanks Sofia. It's all so tiresome when we all know every SOE is corrupt to the core. 
1:14:17,1:16:12, "Derek Jail them ALL YOLO has alot of educational advice 😂😂 @Mark Dijon Ive been saying this since forever ! "Yolo - not to my question you didn't. Viz. ""Do you not see the connection between the ANC being in power and all this corruption being exposed here?""" Yes if they are involved in a dot of crime and corruption JAIL THEM I do Derek. @Thando Nkutha true..its rubbish who is her employer 
1:16:29,1:17:57, we need the guy who hired this woman @Sofia Sofia I think we need to get more radical. We must follow the Chinese example - death to corrupt officals. r these colonizers going jail or naw "This woman knew what she was doing yes @Derek Main I mean what's the hold on punishment ? What are they waiting for ? she is thief! why does she smile at the chair like hes about to smash give them 1 example of death row ! 
1:18:03,1:20:18, am sure she has invested lots of the profit into properties or offshore account and the business is liquidated.. """I am stuck""😋😋" bring back the money how much was stolen she should pay back the money she was in the crossroads of money laundering sorry I'm late..... who is on the witness stand please? people are greedy hey She can't recall anything.. 
1:20:58,1:26:20, we will NEVER EVER recover all the money stolen ! Not in this life time anyway... And if we think corruption has stopped becos of this state capture ... we are so wrong ! Mrs Tlasana her company was used for the cashflow cow We want all stolen money back People were enriching themselves all along. it was a useless business model..even school leaver could do such a business.. "who is on the stand now "At least she cant plead ignorant @Tholithemba Ntsele people deposit money into her account and instruct her to withdraw it in cash and deliver that money to them..such a nonsense business model!! Me. Kalandra Viljoen is on the stand talking about her Cash-in-Transit company. 
1:27:05,1:32:46, "Felix thanx @jaco badenhorst @Tholithemba Ntsele thats what the commission is trying to tell her and she is very ignorant..she didnt know that she was involved in money laundering @Thando Nkuna that is an amount of cash she delivered. Standard business and that is what is done. Similar to cash delivered to replenish ATMs. @Phillip Cwazibe but you should know where the money comes from..what if it stolen money you are told go cash up? @Thando Nkutha I wonder now if that MoneyGram is linked with SARS transaction tracking mechanisms So it would appear that the ANC has hijacked all State owned Entities to fund their campaigns pay bribes and enrich themselves. I doubt if any foreign governments other than the Chinese would fund it. This is interesting. @Tholithemba Ntsele You're raising a key question. wONDER also if it notifies the traditional banks 
1:33:36,1:36:17, Reinette go on Twitter and follow the story from the beginning on the state capture account and timeline Exactly Yolo This is why we employ accountants and lawyers lock them all up am up to date.... just missed this morning @magda seguin thanx "Moneygram is an internationally controlled entity with serious checks and balances Oh Lord now we gave a prostitute selling sex on this chat site 😲 "Traditional banks are dangerous avoiding SARS 
1:36:51,1:39:41, lie lie Clive now I see. This country needs a total cleaning. Corruption was/is on another level mos. why not using electric transfer They had 4 drivers and nthing about security guards "South African banks was supposed to red flag the millions upon millions that went through but they didn't There are strict laws that govern money to be sent nationally and internationally Mntungwa! The banks were involved listen to the witness and the DCJ thank you 
1:39:55,1:41:48, I think they withdrew the cash from the banks that's why they had unmarked v "@Magda Seguin Spot on! Having worked for SARS Customs was she dragged to come in the house of pain or not The monies are collected from the bank with a SECURE CASH VECHICLE Keith I went through a process including having a tax clearance certificate "Yes Magda who are those pple look at her face😮😥 Banks must return our money also 
1:42:11,1:43:52, is it Bosasa @Magda Seguin Maybe unmarked vehicles intended to avoid from being victims of cash heist? How is this witness connected to SAA? @Tholithemba Ntsele Yes - the ANC has made SA a criminal's paradise. But banks control minimum cash disbursement per client per day LOL yeah "There was a time when unmarked vehicles were said to be the answer against heists @Tholithemba Ntsele Damned straight! i find it hard to believe that she wast aware of her obligations regarding FICA...considering that she has been in this for a while. 
1:44:22,1:46:56, "Fuzile @Ben Cole the connection will probably still come "@Tholithemba Ntsele how quick the bank is to notice when there is something wrong to your account every witness is connected to something here.. "@Magda Seguin Not sure also It sounds suspicious that someone working with so much money does not know that FICA is a legal requirement as an FSB Can this enquiry fast forward Zuma's hearing? I would love to see ANC bring money back if they received from illegal "she lied again 
1:47:36,1:51:30, "@Neo Thebe 😂😂😂 you cant wait @Magda Seguin Found her very ignorant too. She wasn't even sure one can't destroy documents prior before FICA stipulated number of years Everyone bring back money stolen @Thami Ngwenya right!!! @Felix Muyoba Yes I cant wait In all dealings involving legalities documents must be kept for 5 years in some instances 10 years as in obstetrics and gynaecology "Eish Keith 😂 disrespectful to interrupt djc 
1:51:58,1:55:22, She does that all the time Reinette same day service LOL it is difficult to trace these monies because it was just money laundering thats why its not clear cut.. very bad ..... actually arrogant @magda seguin drives Agree @Reinette "Thanks to Agrizzi The most friendliest are the most guilty. 
1:55:47,1:58:27, true @christy @Tholithemba Ntsele You mean she's cute? I can agree She is an enabler that was the purpose of opening her business lol she is biting her nails.... This ANC is ruling for the last time now.Put that on everything or else people will go missing period.i have been supportive from 1991 and still I'm renting/unemployed youth and Single Most people involved in corruption and defrauding others use charm to be convincing.
