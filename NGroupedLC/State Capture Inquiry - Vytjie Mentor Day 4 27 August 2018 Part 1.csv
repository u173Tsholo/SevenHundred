Does anyone know why the testimonies at commissions are only in English? I don't think the witness is telling the truth here its pure fabrication. so she forgot to mention Hlongwa to the Public Protector when she was interviewing her...

Lot of people will be left shocked and reeling she should've done this via skype qha What if the Guptas are only a front for a different party? At this point the ANC should be an afterthought. They're dead to the youth of this country. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 s@SunshineB Shouldn't she use vernacular instead.

1:26:57,1:27:31, but Jonas was given chance to read his statement on friday This one has a ghost writer. I'm not convinced anymore that she wrote on facebook. She is not sure of each and everything. Jonas was reading coz he heard this information on the notes from zero he knew it that one day they will be inquiry guys so Ginger was also captured Mr Lindiwe Zulu But akere if u know u gonna appear on the commssion u prepare ur facts before hand she is bold on facebook we r not dealing with for get here Aaah MS Ginger

1:31:37,1:32:31, she needs to gain confidence and all the truth will eventually comes out "She needs a Xanax i "No matter what happens in these enquiries yes bye But I think it's already too late. Has ANBODY who is commenting here actually been a Whistleblower? Do you know the pressure you are under? She is not lying. It is very diffucult. But guys maybe she needs a break to go and buy back her confidence 
1:33:06,1:34:26, "Tshepang..its not our fault you choose to be stupid either "There are people in SA who still have a backbone Everyone comments here. What are we doing to make this country better for ourselves and the future? too you can see that these idiots that open there mouths on put things on paper are 30% pass rate idiots that are clueless can admin tell her we say she must speak in her own language of which we also don't know which one is it Guys can we stop texting and also take a break. I suggest that the pictures of Gupta brothers and The African guy be brought forward so she get over the confussion of names once and for all. It's seems everyone who will come to testify will claim he or she has been threatened. 
1:34:32,1:38:28, Imagine the chutzpah of an Indian family to assume power over an African state. And even worse imagine the level of obsequiousness and lack of self respect in South Africans who allowed this "well to be honest "Guys Agree with Peter Mabena If the ingredient is wrong the cake will always be a flop. We need to get this country fixed. I come Harrit coz Mr Jonas was telling exactly what he knows without hesitating? i think mentor she will come with something "I am a teacher Trust me she will come differnetly after the brake 
1:39:03,1:42:08, I think so too. Her team will relax her Correct Peter Mabena. In law a comma or full stop at the wrong place can harm you @PETER MABENA I agree. Pictures are required. I hope she has relaxed after the break and comes back fighting Minister of Trade and IndustrySouth AfricaThe Minister of Trade and Industry is a Minister in the Cabinet of South Africa. WikipediaAppointer: Jacob ZumaStyle: The HonourableHolder: Rob Davies I hope she's composed after that round I'm 😂😂 because she was so aggressive on tv. I seriously thought she had her **** together. 1 thing for sure is that she is here for Zumas.. hence why she isn't clear on Indian names like AJ & Atul Why is the Judge leading the advocate in her questioning? That is a worry to me. "JZ RN ""he he he he""" "People were making jokes about obesity above 
1:42:14,1:46:00, the Advocate that is asking questions .... is she state or Zuma ?

Stop explaining and answer directly! Reading some of the messages indicates that South Africans lack patriotism. Many of us are not taking this commission seriously. Credo was correct when he said we are easily infiltrated by other nations because we lack vision and identity.

"bare in mind that her testimony is far much different than the Jonas "southpaw madikizela with a name like that i wouldn't be bothered this is a bloody joke why cant we boikoit this nonsense. this has to stop. Jonas made fun of us and now this clown Fils get a life i do not think this is a small matter.

"kay kay What was she doing in china? you abuse money. Report yourself to the powers that be. And then you are found not guilty 
2:24:23,2:25:23, "it's not hard to follow @peter pott . your account was recently created how did she become a witness seriously Nloya I don't understand whatever language that is chief. The fact remains. These are just statements of two people. Both of them have not even presented any claims and both have no witnesses. Guys just ignore the Gupta team commenting in here. It's a waste of time answering all of them. Uyagula wena Fils seriously if u ppl r unable to see the revelations than u r all fools everyone is surprised by this witness Whos the GUPTA team? Sterkte Vytjie! 
2:25:28,2:26:44, this is a wast of state money mx "kay kay Fils is the first fool... Vytjie was living the life. What position does she hold? they should just allow her to freestyle anything that comes to mind 😂 "southpaw What did ZUMA do to her?/ "Jonas was sharp coz his testimony was based on 2015 events. Today we are dealing with 2010 events  😁😁😁😁😁 
2:27:00,2:28:00, Freestyle...lol...😂😂😂 mentor make me to sleep But the lady leading the questioning is confusing too. We are not dealing with points properly What a waste of taxpayer's money!!! Why does she sound and seem like she doesn't even have anything worthy of evidence to deliver? So u r suddenly an expert Refiloe??? she is making astounding revelations.. are u listening Jonas miraculously cannot remember or distinguish between the two Gupta brothers as to who offered him R 600 million. Tjo even if I had never met you I would most definatly even dream of you hahahaha what is state capture evidence here 
2:28:02,2:29:06, Jonas was sharp? The same Jonas that couldn't tell which Gupta brother allegedly bribed him? Laughable. Just because he was eloquent does not mean he was sharp. "@sanele I agree @Mehluli Moyo these zupta tyrants never get tired. i just imagine what we would have been had the #ANC not recalled the corrupt Zuma. Orifiloe...sorry... this clown is defending herself here "Freddie "eish Thank you Zondo

So Tshepang you guys don't believe that the state capture is real? I think it would be better to know what donald Trump thinks of South @Sanele Dlamini I really can't seem to figure "@ Ntloya @Bronx Wavy i agree but sound fabricated to me. I feel like the story is just made up but they dont want too much details incase they cross examined "In the first place ethics committee 
2:31:37,2:32:22, UBABA KADUDUZANE shes now way too confused one thing the Zupta psychophants dont realise is that the fact that the witness cant remember something(s) doesnt necessarily mean what the witness is saying is untrue. it's hard to remember lies hey 😂 "Cracks  almost thought the screen was frozen "this numpty though- wow "This country is still captured. And a hand full of people are still taking just what they want sanele you are absoluetly right

How much did we(south africa) lend from China to save us? what i don't understand is why aren't people tried ina a court of law - why should these things happen in these special courts where the dentures are removed from the judicial system?

2:37:49,2:38:29, I think one of the reasons they dont try it court is to avoid long arguments raised by different parties which might make the process overdue bravery at it best boss we should salute her zuid afrika is onse lande Which one? "what we are seeing is either truth Bronx u are funny This lady is a minister of WHAT ? "lesetja she sounds like she was an all rounder .... 
2:38:34,2:39:41, her experience can really be depressing. I really feel for her on this matter those who give frank evidence should be honoured with executive position... "@Aubrey Franks i will do so. I knew times were changing when i saw ""China Bank of Costruction"" in the middle of Sandton." probably she forgotten her medicines 😈 Fils get back on the ship u came on and take all the other whites like u 🤣🤣🤣🤣Sofia...What position is that?
