Issue of pension/Profident fund for government employees is a world wide issue do not talk for SA ONLY you must aline yourself with the world Economy Listen to Robert kiyosaki Rich dad on pension fund @Mzalwane Mzala They stole from the SOE's as well small parties may be annoying but have valid points some of us we did experience free voting but fair I don't think so because indeed many people walked in and the voting station closed at 8:25 
26:56,32:01, state capture is here to stay unless the New Dawn loses the Zuma shackles Viva ANC Viva all these inquiries will come to nothing it will be swept under the carpet. it's all smoke and mirrors. "HOW MUCH WORTH NKANDLA I WANNA BUY IT MONDAY AT LEAST MOTHER 40 FAMILIES WILL RESIDES "the real culprits here never get punished "With 91% of stations declared All African leaders must get rid of corruption in order to be respected and improve the economy and lives of the people but I fear this will not change. "Blind faith in a party that betrayed the nation is astounding African leaders are self serving 
32:13,40:36, Counting on CR to change the status quo with a magic wand is like believing in fairy stories.The looters are still in control. after them come the people "@Val Speirs Not all viva anc viva anc corruption no election live streams? Andile Mngxitama...is a joke....pappagaai..... @Donald Geyer he wa just bitter with leaving eff..he is not going anywhere ploitically SARS is investigating tax related claims that were made in this commission.

59:42,1:03:48, your people will never be liberated hope you proud I'm living this banana republic you wont hear it coz you clinically deaf "Hey guys do even benefit from this its quite interesting how much u speak of winning seats however the country is in a state of hopelessness with appaulling high unemployment rate and disgust of poverty @Sipho Owen Ndhlovu ... and inequality who asked EFF to open boarders Is it safe to assume that @Sipho Owen Ndhlovu did not vote?

"Mr Volmink has exceptional institutional knowledge.What a great report.The gross fraud 
1:09:15,1:13:36, blscks can be tribalist and corrupt just a surname to an busness man So much anger against people who chose to exercise their democratic right. Can someone please tell me if there should have been two ballot boxes when voting.. one for Provincial and another for National? anc uses cr to boost their election figures if showerman was still in you had no chanche in 2 million to zero to win Yes Alfred it was the African tribal chiefs that captured their Africans and sold them to Slaves Traders. I read some comments here and you get the feeling that people would have loved to decide for others. of all the ballot boxes lying in the bushes we should been given 4 balot papers and only 1 blank one to blf and eff Did you folk have two ballot boxes when you voted? 
1:14:14,1:18:37, yes i agree they also stole each others wifes and killed each other sometime over a cow ///not talking about the mother inlaws other than border what can think that will benefit people change is scary Is Alfred Nzonza not a South African? @Val Speirs yes we did but the demeaneor of the officials was rude to an absurd point and not bery keen to be ftirndly or helpful and i am old so is my wife @Mzalwane Mzala no citizen not banana rebuplic Where are you from @alfred nzonza ? Azania as that is important 
1:19:00,1:20:50, "Service delivery vague policy that has been there 30 yrs Did you vote @alfred nzonza? l think most of us who are intelligent we are impartiant about the start to end of the process to completion and we interpret situation to suit our desire and expectations When I voted there was only one ballot box is this normal? no I axed @Mzalwane Mzala what the country needs is job creation and i mean in a massive way where politics do not have a say neither unions the workers now @Val Speirs - we had two boxes I am done with you @alfred nzonza 
1:20:56,1:24:26, Yes 5 years ago there was two but not this time.. do you think it is fishy? lets be ready for another protest and poor service delivery I see that in all the provinces the ANC has scored more on the national ballot by about 2 or 3% compared to the provincial ballot. What is the meaning of this? "@Val Speirs sex workers is important for Rama as if HIV is not highest in world in SA Let each employer build their workers a decent home.. @Thando Nkutha get help how do I get hold of the IEC? A friend of mine said that she voted in Hartismith and there was only one ballot box she found this unusual. Gauteng is making me proud! ANC are less than 50% at the moment! 
1:25:24,1:32:20, "degreaser wil remove the indelible ink Who is this man? @Thando Nkutha So if Africa wants to be at table - OAU MUST form economic block. unemployed must get first chance ie labourers and their quakifications will not count as he will earn a wage that can sustain him and family this must continue permanantly and not be piece meal then where they can be taught a trade students with exceptional high kevel iq can study for free and work of the study loans over time study free AND work off study loans? Say what? @Thando Nkutha America did Thando Nkutha . No question. Just stating fact. If Africa wants to progress - we better unify. I think a model which sets rules of coperation economically. A @Thando Nkutha combine the countries = 1 president 
1:33:01,1:36:36, "@Thando Nkutha the grant system lend a hand to the election numbers as most of the persons are old people and are told yhat goverment will stop it if you vote against it or them so they vote in ignorence "@Thando Nkutha So I am saying How do Africans Unify there land? route sorry "Congratulations to all those who supported or voted ANC as it seems their party has all but won the election. Personally @Thando Nkutha yes with exceptions @Thando Nkutha we are too small sir. Look up our share of world population as a continent vs economic share. You cant think present tense if you want to thrive in 20 to 50 years DISSABILITY GRaNT IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR 
1:37:15,1:40:01, Doing business is great and the right thing to do....as long as the deals are fair etc....... "more of same with anc @Thando Nkutha Read a bit of sociology. It is almost and evolutionary thing that humans progressed to commune in larger and larger groups. From small family groupings killing each other for food to china is not our friend!!! @Thando Nkutha 195 nations states in the world right now. you cannot ally with them!!! But be careful of the Commies....... as i am disable person myself bieng it olny in the brain si my hands and legs stil work so it means no grant so i must no go and steal for food and because my brain is difunctional i get caught I am certain there are many other parties that will point out their own success in these elections. I congratulate those too. All I can say I a feel privileged to have cast my vote freely and no fear 
1:40:19,1:44:16, then the 195 states have groups themselves into economic blocks. Except Africa. Have we not evolved ? or have we done so at a slower rate due to impact of colonisation ? when do we start thinking @Norman Zwane ...spot on Bra African Culture was messed by Colonising..Now !!! We need to sort out this Unbalanced state of Cultures.If I invite someone to come stay with me I need to provide for its clear that the kracka pink face creators give clear examples of Conism. south africa is a steam kettle boiling a lot of liquids at the same time where most agree to disagree "pardon me @Thando Nkutha Amen @Toni Oliveira .....Sorry Bra.....we would not have come this far without the Settlers/Colonists....we should be very grateful for them.....facts @Thando Nkutha I meant states/countries thats long history 
1:44:26,1:50:09, @Thando Nkutha Also consider nationalism and fragmented globe (forget continent) in era of WMD and climate change and global conflict "@MIKE LOCK Settlers should be grateful they found SA Plenty of blacks have left Africa to go and live in the pink faces countries.. why do you think that is? @The Truth ....this is true......they built this beautiful country......with help of course Population Control!!! @Thando Nkutha Really. Right now you cant negatiate with Germany. You do so with the EU. But they deal with SA as standalone. Just bow and take whats coming! Dont forget security co-op. NATO especiall @mike lock. Yip beautiful country..Settlers built it with help of All Africans. "@MIKE LOCK This country ws built by the hands 
1:50:15,1:54:24, But..African Culture was maybe is not high rise buildings and highways. As much as Mbeki was aloof and cold. he drove this agenda. But also did so because he had less and less credibility to address local issues and occupied his time on Africa and global issues @The Truth ...and in those days it was the norm for explorers to sail to other continents are populate a continent......we will be ever grateful to them... @Thando Nkutha SA debt levels cant increase - we already teetering full on junk status. Co's local and foreign are not investing. We not growing. Unemployment is ball what happen next is we see pink face people begging on the corner with tin cup "balooning. we have to grow to first absorp labour @the truth.That is the point Im trying to make..It is exactly the same today.Majority still labour for the benefit of the few..The black folk were quite happy as they were.WE messed their systems up. @Thando Nkutha Agree we have had poor leadership. Quite honestly it ended with Mandela - althoug his focus was reconciliation mainly. Economy was left to Mbeki - from term 1 already. "Anyone interested in 'talking' business with a potential BEE partner? If you 'buy' into the general concept of BEE 
1:55:43,1:57:56, @Thando Nkutha Maybe you should spend time and analyse the numbers and the political speak. not @Norman Zwane ......that's great but as long as the partner has capital to put into the business....right "@MIKE LOCK It was ""a norm"" because the inhabitants they found in those countries "@Thando Nkutha As much as we criticise the USA @ Zwane .Ill talk BEE with you .Come put your name on my business profile I will pay you R5000 per month and dont ever have to see you again.That is BEE..Wake up dude @The Truth ...bulldust...they improved everybody's lives..... "@MIKE LOCK We will never be grateful to thieves @Thando Nkutha Mandela recon project shud not be underestimated. He ensured that this place didnt end up in a blood bath. Numerous examples worldwide of potential more likely ways SA cud have gone 
1:58:44,2:00:12, @Thando Nkutha Yes he didnt focus on the detail. Thabo ran that really for 3 terms !!!!! @E RUT Just enjoyed following your exchanges with @Thando Nkutha. If you don't mind my jumping in: My personal disappointment was to see how our white counterpart simply sulked for loss of privilege well the colonialists could have done as Hitler did to the Jews.. which I condemn @Thando Nkutha Yes FACT. So do we cry or think ? @Toni Oliveira I wish more white folk could think like you. That is the kinda mindset that helps a nation move forward Bantus should be grateful the Dutch allowed them to stay here but now they have the audacity to claim land from the people who built this country.Sickening "roosefeld wife she told her husband in the peresion days how to get out of depresion is create jobs @The Truth ....na don't think so.....we would not be here today.....if they never settled here...think about in Bra "guys the are some coloured who still think they are white and no matter how they convince themselves they are black 
2:00:54,2:02:32, mandela tood for non racial s.a but where are we now i dont think the anc is still upholding mandelas vision "@MIKE LOCK Lol Not all blacks are equal.Theres something insidious about Bantus. @Danie Nilsen i'm agreeing with your statement war always create masive jobs as they rotate as they died and rhen the logistics for the war is masive so who wil we go to war with he asked .. it does not matter who or where Sasha you should be a disgrace to your children dammmmmm "@Sasha and the same doesnt apply to whites Same for all.But other races dont live in the VICTIM MENTALITY.it helps NO ONE @MIKE LOCK In my mind I am visualising such a relationship. The partner would finance their investment. The cash injection would be ring-fenced to enhance the partnership than be a buy out. 
2:02:47,2:05:37, we are long pass baby steps We even have BEE prostitutes here commentating. How can we take this seriously...Cmon @Thando Nkutha. Maybe read a bit. Start by looking at big picture then work down to detail level. We need plan to become wining nation. We have gone backwards "I wish the whites who call themselves Afrikaners will educate themselves "@Sasha Try being raped @The Truth......no...you not getting it......most of us would not be here.........the tribes would have killed each other etc.....and i would not be here......and now..I'm a Proud S/African.... "The ""Afrikaners"" also need to be civilized Sasha U such a joke The Black Africans are by far the most intelligent people in South Africa 
2:06:24,2:07:26, Sybil Stephens Re-read your statement.. something is wrong so MANDELA prevented bloodshed. this clearly states that APARTHEID wasn't bloodshedüòÇüòÇ I am not an Afrikaaner nor was I part of any Apartheid. I was living in Botswana during those years. @Thando Nkutha Start with size of world economy (analyse by how the have made alliances) and then compare to world by population size. Then sit quiet and THINK. How do we box smart "I dont like bullies "@Toni Oliveira I get your drift but that is not the kind of 'piggy-back' I am looking for "The thugs @Thando Nkutha Dont worry if you only 25 "@MIKE LOCK Then you have no idea of SA history and culture. Zulu's & Sotho's were only separated by the drakensburg 
2:07:57,2:10:45, @ at Sasha no one is being triggered by you being a CLOWN and trying to entertain us You can't change African mentality they will always vote for the liberators who are corrupt. they only want minerals "hehehehe @Sasha.Dutch didnt build any land..The land WAS ..IS...WILL BE.. "@MIKE LOCK I still make the point why not let the corupters rule the country buptas zuma floyd all soe.s multichoice and make steve hofmeyer president oh and ace magastealing "Yes "@Val Speirs blacks dont have liberators alive 
2:10:47,2:13:13, "@Thando Nkutha. But difficult if you are a featherweight going against the heavies. Even if you hit @The Truth .....the point of the matter is.....most of us would not be here ....be grateful for history....remember the past......live for today...and plan for the future.......and progress...right.. "@MIKE LOCK You don't thank you boss for paying you month end The word corruption is being misused "‚Äã@MIKE LOCK U don't thank you boss for paying you month end @Zwane.Just trying to help you along..I have no desire in BEEing my fellow South African. Japan was Fckd to the core after ww2 and look what they were able to accomplish through sheer determination.The people of a country is its biggest assets.A large part of SA doesnt get it.
