time,13:11,message African time 👍🏽 thank you chair Chair is there any law that prevents you from taking over this evidence leading thing? We are running out of time and the evidence leaders seem as if they don't understand. People have to go to jail. kubi @Yolo More .... spot on ! why we do not see the witness Under witness protection 👍 
14:14,17:55, "@Heather Cotton​ NPA even slower than Zondo Commission ! @phillip.... I wonder... I see Miss Wentzel realised that her Blouse was gaping for the hour before lunch. Maybe it was just me. :) waste of tax payers money So the new ticket invoice Flight center generated was a valid invoice or fraudulent? "@Heather Cotton quite so. Munusamy on discuss leave after implication The findings of the DCJ will be more heavier than those of the other chairs who presided over other commissions. I hope and pray that he uses an iron fist when he makes the findings. Ramaphosa must duck....... bring Bolsonaro 
18:43,26:04, @Rudi H even discuss leave was also fine because she's in discussions with her lawyers to respond to her being implicated 😂 secrets exposed Makoya Aggrizzi "Chair asked the advocate and General Naidoo to speed things up Colonels doing flight bookings and car maintenance 🤦🏽‍♂️ "Watson @watson mutanga ... exactly "@Yolo.DCJ Zondo didn’t talk about irrelevant questions Watson he was being modest😂😂 
27:47,32:14, "Whilst DCJ appears a perfectionist "Watson It would take 5 years to get through no? Panel of judges oh I miss you so much Ms Hofmeyr! "Eish guy also "@ Kay Kay  "The Judge the Advocate must hurry This hearing needed 5 Judges One man wont manage 
32:19,34:56, the information is too much "@Kay Kay "Hofmeyer adv Hofmeyr would be done and dusted by now "@Rudi H: The stakes are enormous for the country. In my view or Mokoena they must be busy with other big fish They are busy with the big fish. The likes of Dudu Myeni and Koko Matamela. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
34:57,38:12, "@Watson mutanga I hope so. this witness useful tool for big crooks. "Dammit Cele must be relived of his duties now The NPA with its chameleon pace is not helping @ all Sadly those implicated don’t see that they did anything wrong... dissonance "Tikvah 9 days holiday bheki! while your country going up in flames. those smart hats of yours we paid for. come to Zondo. @Kay Kay: True. Even the Nugent Inquiry had more than one. 
38:16,43:58, The DCJ keeps on referring to the witness as a her but the witness sounds like a man to me. 😂😂😂😂😂his fancy hats @Mlondi Moya lol he is trying to confuse the enemy. @Tikvah Olam this country is open for corrupt things only. If u want lawful and legal things like law and order not in South Africa. 8 people flying to Singapore to buy 1 equipment which should had been ordered online. @sekgolo Johannes. thanks for the clarification judge's health of concern to me. working himself to death...

"DCJ Zondo seem to be interested in this witness more than any other witnesses who have appeared before this commission Yes the judge has been ill for sometime... @Tikvah is he a spy still today what information of the intelligence are suppose to be classified and subsequently not suppose to be made publicly "After this strenuous commission Perhaps who they spied on? Politicians etc?
