The wastage here and at SOEs is horrifying. The government wants to turn it's land into rich men's playgrounds for profit. @Letladi Sekoele no politician is innocent and no political party is 100% honest but some are just filthy eg.

To me it is an insult to the family of Hani using his death a weapon where he never talk trut The sound off create jobs was just a ANC joke to let people to vote for them We cannot have no government but we need a political party which will make it much smaller. Socialism is killing our economy/country and people will soon be starving.

Mugabe was put by the British and he changed his mind they removed him BTW the people who made Zuma Steal are from India (Guptas) that is the east. Who gives us guns to kill each other My wish is to know who ordered Cde Chris Hani's assasination.Msholozi was painted with lies as if he brought the Guptas and other in the country of which its not the truth. Nelson Mandela brought them EFF will the next government mark my word

The EFFing 🎊 The west is the cause of our problems ZUMA is just as gulity Poor little victims - always blame others for their shortcomings Yes we stole the designs from others but the R1 - R5 are made by Denel he claims to know but he hasnt exposed him?
