time,-2:06,message Who is the witness today? "former Director Generals of GCIS @Yolo More GM. I think Mzwanele Jimmy Manyi and Themba Maseko. Both repeats Thankyou Slie. I hope they are not too ill to come before the commission. WHEN ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING TO START ON TIME. SORRY I FORGOT....THIS IS AFRICAN TIME. @Yolo More I think Zuma is just chicken - he's faking. enca is live Thanks Pastor J. How I wish Adv Kate deals with Manyi decisively. 
1:35,5:49, @Pastor J How are you my dearest brother? Long time i HOPE SO TOO @Yolo More And we have Tannie Kate. Manyi deserves a Maleka Lex Luger Maleka decided to leave. Just started and she wants to adjourn already. So we saved a few million while commission did not sit ? @Yolo More Really? What was his gripe? "I""m still alive and kicking" "Lex Luger 
6:32,10:00, üòÅüòÅüòÅhe wanted the chair to throw his chair around? Is this a new venue? looks like they moved "@Lex Luger @Yolo More . You are correct DCJ limited and restricted him excessively in interrogating the evidence of Jimmy ""Naughty Boy"" Manyi. It seems that was the reasoning of the fallout." it's temporary venue "Hai "Yes Luger "Surprise zurprise so i wish watch 
10:44,15:14, "Pastor J I think that when Maleka was restricted he should have pulled out the Sjambok and sorted this Jimmy thingie staright away. Hahahahahaha Different venue? "Manyi is a coward where is former president now? "He is ""too ill""" they saying he's sick * Jacob* @sechaba Montso Zuma is too scared to appear - he's faking illness. Playing golf with Zabier Schaik ? 
15:56,19:29, what's up with the new look? Zuma wont return to the commission. watch the space Zuma has enough wives looking after him that we pay each one plus babies Nith'uZuma Wenzeni? The venue looks different? Is a new venue or make over? @sechaba Montso Waiting at the Jail gates for admission. In the meantime the Tailor is measuring him so they will make him a free new suit. A orange one They‚Äôve polished all their heads for makeover nhlanlha saying venue is temp hey y'all 
19:34,26:55, Zuma cant handle the state capture its becoming too hot to handle than anticipated. Last time he mentioned his voice going up and down due to flu no wonder what illness does he have now. judge def has respiratory problems ingoung ongoing when is Mr Jacob Zuma going preson? Lies has short legs it does not travel far. I will advise him to take a shower so that the illness can go away or be healed so that he can attend the state capture commission.. @Richard Nyila ....But he could have taken a shower for the flu as well. He said that the shower is the perfect cure for everything. Shame on him for still ducking and diving. On the 2nd thought Pastor you hit a nail in the head there true indeed. "morning guys Whats going on 
27:00,30:28, The doctor who booked Zuma off 'sick' needs to be investigated. Zuma is a con artist. Zuma is too sick to appear?? LOOOOOOOOL Looking forward to hearing from Manyi how he managed to pay for ANN7 on his meagre government salary. Where is this place? @Thapelo Motabogi Yes - JHB Council Chamber "@Francoise Phillips The same skelm who was Shabir ""Tiger Woods"" Shaik""s Doctor. Buggers" Is Mr Zuma liable to chances of impresonment at anytime ever? Did the old venue become a security risk? Or why did they change? @Shane Aniruth The Landlord is an implicated Party 
32:22,37:58, @Francois Phillips if i recall the ANN7 was sold to Manyi for half a Billion (R500 M) i just cant remember the term or the agreement that was entered into between Manyi and the Guptas on repayments? "The venue is to be used by the owner of the venue for the rest of the week. Thereafter @Richar Nyila I clearly remember Manyi stating to the press that he had 'fully paid up' the half a billion. Strange for an ex government spokesperson to have such funds. "Ricus Ellis @Francoise Phillips Manyi lost his money. Derek Main I doubt he ever had any. "@Francoise Phillips True ""The purchase price is to be funded by Oakbay via a loan it advances to Manyi‚Äôs company.""" @Francois Jhaaa nhee interesting indeed i thought there entered into some sort of arrangement because Manyi did not have R500 M then i missed that one that he paid in full then he is the loser indeed. would the commission supply me with documents evidance of the case at hand? 
41:48,48:57, This lady is thorough. I think commission sent Zuma today's affidavits rebutting his previous testimony and found out that he will further embarrass himself basically all he said last time was simply not true -i like this Adv's follow ups Zuma will be coming on 11th November Case they are Chickenshit scared....ghehehe Ooop..cause.. @EDWARD LEGONG Not any more - he's faking illness. He's a coward. "I wasn't aware ZUMA....tactics.......Again...... 
48:59,56:16, The term is DIRECTORS GENERAL and not director generals big up Zuma there is no need for you to come here ths is a waste of ur tym @Thabelo Emmanuel I agree with you - he must just go to his corruption case. Whatever he says here is a lie. No special treatment for him....at all.... he will never come coz he protect the corrupt Anc @badboy styla ......eeeesh i'm also Very concerned.....and even afraid.... "BREAKING NEWS.......The CMA ( Comrades Marathon Assoc.) has confirmed that Jacob ""Zoomer"" has been given automatic entry into the next race. Apparently he is the Greatest ""Runner"" ever." "I personally think "rural and urban citizens 
56:54,59:30, @Pastor J ü§£ Yep - he's breaking all the records. That's also why he built a chicken run. "Zuma might appear coming Monday @badboy styla ....Reckon we need some of coalition government.... D9cuments pls chair!! This country need the Arab springs uprising by citizens from all walks of life seemingly no ANC or DA or EFF or any other small political parties can fix the current quagmire its a bomb about to explo @Derek Main hahahahahaha. @EDWARD LEGONG I agree - we SAfns are far too patient with these crooks. They continue to be in government and continue to steal the money. things are going worse and worse I agree with Edward Legong we should 
59:40,1:02:00, What happens if they get arrested You keep voting the crooks back in parliament after receiving food parcels and T shirts Who is in the hot seat?????????????????????????? ESKOM alone owes debtors R450 Billion and it cant even repay interests on monthly basis from that amount because it running at a loss. Spend more money on operations than maintainance and upkeep... All these politicians are robbing us blind. They are the only ones not feeling the pinch. They live large. themba maseko The Tea Lady/ Mixer Operator is asleep at the wheel as usual. Jeez Louise. You guys can't get the sound right two hours in a row. Has the commission changed its venue???????????????? @Dan Brown Check your device and volume settings. The volume has been 100% great since the start 
1:02:14,1:06:16, "@Elvis Malakoane If his lips are moving I hear you badboy he will break that machine or confuse it "Can those found guilt be prosecuted This venue looks strange to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Edward even Ramaphosa is corrupt himself "Am hurt cos "Pastor J You didn't watch from the beginning. The Sound people are so unprofessional. I am a Sound Engineer and am embarrassed by the constant wild variations in Level @Elvis Malakoane Yes - at least then we know we are not being BSed. 
1:07:05,1:09:48, Derek Main then we must pray he gets stroke if you dont deal with dangers to society it just emboldens other dangers to society "@EDWARD LEGONG Unfortunately our leaders need to have fear or they will never change their corrupt ways "Seriously @EDWARD LEGONG Or a tax revolt. Shut off their funds. "Prosecuting those found guilty now "Yah tax revolt will just hurt the less fortunate of our country we need to use the power vested in us and just vote properly 
1:11:03,1:18:58, the anc have been looting our country for 25 years and we keep putting them back in power what sort of message do you think that sends them We need to develop a system that will monitor they too much government bodies and it should be by the public through a process done so in public domain or platform we here all public can have a say "@Kapn Krunch While I agree with you RE the ANC looting i agree@ Robert Nyila we need to strip their wealth and put them in the slammer we need them to feel the fear so they can actually do something productive or face the consequences or nothing will ever change Kapn Krunch I agree with you ! @Thando Nkutha You mean to the ANC? You'd have to have rocks in your head to vote for them after hearing of all this corruption. "Weed party yay @Thando Nkutha That's not an either-or. There are many other parties. 
1:19:31,1:25:30, Any party except the Commie ANC and EFF.....really .....I reckon some sort of coalition form of Gov....... we must remove race from political parties thats one of our biggest problems its all about race @Thando Nkutha Yes - I do. I think they are fools for voting ANC. We've heard of how the ANC politicians behave from this commission. What on earth makes you think they care for us? @Thando Nkutha Like I've said - there are other parties. The ANC have proven they cannot govern with any integrity. The other parties should be given the opportunity to improve on that. all parties should represent south africans not demographics of south africans is all im saying how do we unify when government constantly segregate So then they are to blame.........they are then predetermining their own future..........just like Zim.....China........Ven.........etc etc etc.... All just sheepal ...I'm afraid.......... @Thando Nkutha You're right - I'm not understanding your point. Are you saying the the ANC voters may vote for DA & FF+? 
1:26:09,1:31:13, ANC are populist and just tell whoevers listening what they want to hear they are like cheap conmen decieving millions If the DA are doing what the ANC have done.....Wound NEVER vote for them.......cannot be Married to a particular party........use da brains..... @Thando Nkutha You do realise that at the last national elections there were something like 48 parties to vote for. madiba didnt tell people what they want to hear he told people what they needed to hear its not just politics its bad politics "As long as the ANC is in power @Thando Nkutha You don't have that excuse anymore. Revive UDF @Derek Main ......Man......people just cannot or will not.....think further than the nose........true..... "he told everyone that all were equal and all south africans 
1:31:24,1:35:07, nobody wanted to hear that he stood against vengeance @Thando Nkutha No - there are other parties. Has the venue changed? ü§î @Thando Nkutha And most of us were overjoyed then - now we cry when the ANC wins. i disagree Love that settlements is only in millions of rand. @Thando Nkutha So what you are saying is that you are being ruled by fear - fear of the EFF. I never want to live my life being ruled by fear. machelon vha2 vhothe 
1:35:56,1:43:48, hello guys is the house changed @fikile seems so. Council Chamber in JHB This venue has features of Home Affairs Office temporary venue for 2 days only fellas 15 or so players play their heart out on the field for 80or so minutes nbring the country to such joy n compare them to 400n so members of parliament shouting point of order for 5years or so @Lawrence Motshoane You are correct Sir "@Thando Nkutha ""EFF does not respect the lwas of the country..."" Which laws?? Is not the EFF that Pushed the same ANC to protect the Constitution and respect the laws of the country?" hohoo.... "@Thando NKhutha 
1:44:38,1:46:59, "Nande PLS LEAVE ZUMA'S NAME OUT OF THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It starts with Malema? It starts with the way he is dealing with issues in this country. WHO IS THIS CORRUPTIONIST???????? So you must also pay back the money We will see split in Eff @Mbuso Ndlovu ...sorry mate.......Zupta is one of the main bad boys.........true... Mbuso Ndlovu Zuma is the extinct rhino in the room 
1:47:21,1:51:07, ZUMA IS INNOCENT UNTILL PROVEN GUILTY Who is this Mr Baloyi they're talking about? @Mbuso Ndlovu We changed that Theory for Zuma....GUILTY until proven innocent "When it smells of corruption Pastor J Well said WHY THE COMMISSION VENUE CHANGED?????? IS THERE A BOMB I PARKTOWN??? Reckon the Tax Man gotto trace ALL the money and bring it back..........and then the Corrupted to be punished .....harshly....... "@Thando Nkutha I ask you with tears in my eyes - if the ANC 
1:51:19,1:58:32, Mbuso Ndlovu pay attention and NEVER suggest a BOMB...the normal place is hired out - simple @Thando Nkutha You're right - the ANC is definitely not going to turn it around. @Karen x How can they hire such important place for the commission; This is a waste of taxpayers money It is worth every cent to bring all this corruption to our attention "@ Jane It has been long time not watching state capture Chair Zondo is ID picture and witness. @Jane .Blamire I also agree - I think this commission needs to run permanently to continue exposing the corruption to public scrutiny. Well it is clear that Angus Buchan is not the answer Who noes........maybe the Big Guy In The Sky has a plan for SA........... 
1:58:58,2:01:31, I feel like Ms Hoffmeyer knows something üôà Angus who? the amount lost to corruption and theft cannot be compared to what the commission is spending!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ "ANC destroyed everything build up over 342 years @Granny Mokwena TRUE "AAAAG Granny ANC corruption is unbelievable Dunno.........The National Party were punished.......and now the ANC/EFF are Being punished.........is that sweet poetic justice............heheheh..... 
2:01:43,2:05:11, Of course it can be compared Granny Mokwena. The commission is looking at an amount of 120 million i like to differ in this fashion of comparison Compare to hundreds of billions @Annalie Elizabeth ...nothing compared to the Billion/Trillions stolen from us.......true Thank you @ Annalie.. BRING BACK THE MONEY....... Again people are shooting off without knowing or bothering to research the facts. "the commission is worth every penny 
2:05:17,2:08:23, I suppose that is how things run in this country Everyone is a rocket scientist...that is why we sit where we do @joe nkabinde ...my friend.......never ever trust ANY gov....with ANYTHING............. NEVER @joe nkabinde And how do you think that's working out for us all? the country we are living in unbelievable Any Gov.......even if their is a new Gov in SA........ We live in the most beautiful country in the world been to NZ? 
2:08:27,2:10:06, pITY ABOUT THE ONES THAT WANT TO DIVIDE AND RULE @Annalie Elizabeth Yes we do - it's a pity about the politicians though. the politicians nothing is workable we are going more deeper into problems each day or night Yes Rob not a patch on my country @Annalie Elizabeth ...it's All about Power and Money i'm afraid...... All over the world "south africa is very workable and fertile That's a fact...... 
2:10:15,2:14:17, "Mr Baloyi is confused. If Mr Maseko found out with the rest of cabinet that he's going to DPSA "@Aj Otto But we shouldn't have to fight against our public ""representatives"" in order to do that." @Derek Main I agree passionately some time you fill its enough to understand """he'll make a plan for me""" So whats wrong with JZ? @Thando Nkutha Pay attention!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's how comrades are hired. JZ is too ill to appear before the commission. 
2:14:24,2:15:55, Bird flu? Ebola?Small Pocks? Zumatjie has shamalitis......a very bad sickness.... @Annalie Elizabeth He's faking - just a garden-variety coward. @Thando Nkutha He was moved from one position to another in government instead of being thrown out in the street nice Garden - variety? Did the dagga dry up? Johnny Walker will sort him out and give him courage........heheh @Thando Nkutha they made a plan for him "@Derek Main 
2:16:21,2:18:52, Ag Mbuso. there was no reason to throw him to the streets my friend Julian Assange is a diplomat but he has been tortured and I have big worries for him he needs full attention in respect of consent and not just in the public interest but in his own + Suzie we don't care about Assange @MIKE DURBAN Or a blerrrrry hottttt Durban bunny.Even kills the most severe diseases. who needs a shower if you can have a durban bunny @Suzie Greer I am with you and Julian Assange. He's been treated despicably by so-called civilised nations. that was brilliant of you Maseko because you were going to join the unemployed. @Pastor J .....tooo true.....and don't forget the dhol......heheh @Suzie Greer Julian Assange is a hero who highlighted the corruption of the world's governments. @Thando Nkutha He wanted to put bread on the table 
2:19:12,2:23:26, "Assange may get hurt @Suzie Greer The silence of the media regarding Assange is telling.

2:34:04,2:41:24, WHO IS JULIAN????? @Pastor J No - there was never a charge - he was only requested to give a founding statement. No charges ever laid. Julian Assange 'commited treason' by revealing crimes of government ~ classic tale of Terrorist vs Hero @Derek Main . I am confused. He holed up in that embassy to avoid extradition on that charge as well as the US charges relative to the Wikileaks issues. I need enlightening @Pastor J ... there so that he could be sent to the US for spying charges. The rape charge was simply a ruse. @Pastor J He offered to give a deposition in the UK but Sweden refused because that would thwart their plans. "Hmm Yoh. All that misery at the embassy because of vindictiveness and anger of some Govt or another. What a messed up world we live in @Pastor J Yes - and all because he exposed the truth of what our governments get up to. He's a hero in my book. 
2:42:09,2:47:00, @Pastor J He's now being kept in solitary confinement in UK and is not allowed to prepare his defence or meet lawyers. @Diss & Dad I am going to try and get a copy ordered. Thanks always for the very valuable insight and info that you share with all of us. I appreciate you my friend. ++it would be too damaging as I'm sure you must realise he has won medals of bravery a statue in his name he is a VIP my Country Has already been fined. my friend is a diplomat. "I always had great difficulty in understanding but more so respecting these so called ""Democracies"" being the US and UK. I see more and more hypocracy rather than democracy that they preach" Guys......It's All about power etc......one world government etc......this will Control everybody.....etc etc... One Gov.....one currency........one micro chip...... @Diss & Dad Yes - it was. It sounded like they were playing a computer game. One Anti Christ........ @MIKE DURBAN I've always said that people will eventually beg to be micro-chipped. It'll be cool like Facebook. Everyone will want it.
