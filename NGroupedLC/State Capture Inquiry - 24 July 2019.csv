Mazotti is Malema's china. Malena rents his house. @XhoiXhoi GrandSon who is? welcome back Lorraine.....were u waiting for the boss to go out... Lindiwe is very cheeky. Gordhan did nothing illegal 
44:38,45:53, Gordan is a Dog u r racist "can EFF please tell us what Gordhan did they must arrest mazot then if he is guilty what is stopping the police in doing that @XhoiXhoi GrandSon why so angry?? Bantu Sfiso what proof do you have that Gordhan is a Racist? this translator is excellent "Lets hate someone on facts that we know  go and search in the internet what did he do 
46:07,47:20, wiNdoda Dlamini wiNdoda Sibalikhulu. Hidden trying to stop corruption. Gordon tried to get monies from tax dodgers lik mazoti. that is his only crime "Eff its eff so there is no way we cn not generalize if their leadership is in friendship with mazzoti's. We dnt any proof They taught CR will dismiss Gordon so they can continue stealing get the eff out of here..hahahahaha then kabelo is kalbelo @XhoiXhoi GrandSon you're starting to sound like one; everyone here is civilized... gordan forced malema to pay 20million tax and siezed his farm 
47:27,48:19, "if Julius Malema is not racist Jabu that's what they want "Gordhans Intelligence Unit raided Mazotti residence and business he is a tax evader and owes SARS R34. 95 million. Mazotti is Malema @Lungisani mabaso whether you like it or not EFF will rule it's only a matter of time "She is the best indeed  "Gordon has put a stop to a lot of corrupt deals at saa I think NOT Yes agree "I ask again 
48:38,49:51, "parly made a biggest mistake of appointing Mkwebane PP. she's factional. she came in as a spy to advance Zuma @jabu go and search it your self 2jabu dont be lazy "Dream on  lol. so u don't no then ama Fikile Gordhan represents a risk to the continued malfeasance by connected EEF acolytes wrong answer He gave Ivan Pillay early retirement and rehired him few years later.. is that his crime? Where is the sign language person??? 
49:59,50:21, la rasa @ Kay Kay yes she is a liar @jabu i know and i did my research nawe please do yours @Thando Nkutha .You have lost your touch Bro. The Bots have survived for too long now. Th extermination must start NOW @XhoiXhoi GrandSon that is my real name; not anonymous "He went after tax dodgers Up The EFF will be knocked off one by one. "@malinga 
50:40,51:40, so we know 3 beneficiaries of Estina are dead; we don't know why/how "Fikile @Lance Crawford I agree with u about Sign Language @Jabu Malinga Why rehire someone who asked for an early retirement? ..So there where beneficiaries that did not benefit or there were no beneficiaries recorded on the books before the project kicks off.....Who are this beneficiaries if there where none... "Did he hav estina dairy deals "because Goshen arrested Malema when he was not paying tax @Kay Kay The DA for one warned the ANC about Mkwebane but it fell on deaf ears. Now they're stuck with their feet in their mouths. @Greg Rowles I read yesterday one of the beneficiaries was murdered 
51:43,52:38, @jabu many which you cannot finish it here in this platform godhan "Carnoth Anyone know what happened to the PIC live stream? "@ngomane has a court found Gordon guilty? "if so This was the Hawks during Bernings time. Get him here. Now! @Jabu Malinga what was the rationale for an early retirement and rehiring? 
52:46,53:57, The PP is corrupt. she finding against Gordon is to suit the zuma faction narrative. Now let the court test her again Subpoena the Hawks... First one. The Judge will make a ruling on Monday about Gordhan. @Thando Nkutha she is Adv. Leah Gcabashe Jesus is Victor! "Carnoth @jabu.... go to sleep bro. jabu u writer my brother "Aphiwe 
54:06,55:21, @jabu the public protector is an office do you know that? "the judge won't make decision on Fordham pravin being persecuted for early retirement to Pillay and for goin after tax fraudsters... hahahhaha Jabu must write a book man..... This Man is so relaxed....i like it mafia state h Scorpions were the best but Zuma got rid of them and put all his corrupt comrades in the Hawks. Then they tried to frame Colonel Booysen and one other. @Lorraine Naidoo mafia state.... 100% agreed 
55:28,56:29, i like this man is very brave "Guys if you a true patriotic south african ignore EFF out of your will ....as it stand they are game changes in south african politics .And If could not have been eff where could country be by now "pravin is a big crime lord hey @Talent P Sibisi ...i tried that yesterday..but they still here..haaaaa let dose guy leave he tells all the truth nt hiding anything "@Jabu Malinga im sure there was a reason for early retirement PP is being handled by the zuma faction.. unlike some other guy who can sell ice to the eskimos.... 
56:32,58:12, @Damaking Alie what's wrong with people this Dlamini guy's he the one who telling us a truth here Jabu must be an EFF supporter.. can always tell. "When you have lost gains of your hard work Mr Dlamini u in danger Boss big time danger this is deep yoohh lobaba usenkingeni PP is also protected by the EFF thugs "Carnoth Can we please keep Mr. Dlamini safe? Use my tax money to protect him with 100 body guards and 10 snipers 
58:22,59:30, yYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANC PEOPLE ARE DANGEROUS "These poor people have been treated with such disrespect IMALI NGU SATANA that video gone now life means nothing to them...we spoke about this yesterday Lorriane ohh realy "Carnoth "Is so Lets remember that two whistle blowers were killed late last year or early this year 
59:43,1:00:07, Ooooh... I'm scared😲😲😲 "Apart from Busisiwe Mkwebane being implicated here @Jabu Malinga so every government employee should do same when in need of money That PP failed to bring this evidence ANC but "By the way "Today sizulu This man was an employee at Estina farm @Greg Rowles yoooo dangerous 
1:00:19,1:00:50, malema is a hero for those ppl who are not up to date and read news about our country "That's fine ibuhlung bab jabu. Sorry Benificiary 😭😭 Take some of Zuma's security away and give to this guy !! "so Carnoth YOh this testimony shame this witness is danderous

Dangerous to whom?? "and by the way wena Carnoth the love off money and power hawks must give back their copies of their statements They craping in there pants right now 
1:01:47,1:02:37, anc mafias "I ask u again wena Carnoth MAFIOZO What is happening to Cyril and Pravin is a push back from looters - EFF is just a staff rider in the agenda because of their narrative agenda driven by populism this witness is a hero he means he willprotect himself n never die alone sitting "I still believe that HAWKS are still captured even under this so called new dawn. They tipped Ace before raid "Com Carnoth 
1:02:55,1:03:27, "@Jabu Malinga i dont remember saying PG is a criminal yooooh this witness could be the brother of the actor who play Shaka Zulu Lorraine..they chocking EFF and DA are trying to split ANC so that Magashule faction joins EFF and Ramaposa faction joins DA. "I FOR 1 I have no issues on who gave money to CR17 did He just mentioned Busisiwe Mkhwebane "Carnoth This poor fellow having to watch everyone he comes into contact with in case they kill him. So many people have had their lives threatened ... 
1:03:30,1:04:13, U will be sleeping on top on the roof from today bcs we dnt know the involvement of police and the hawks in this matter This interpreter is doing far better than that other guy thank you Buyiswa!!! The pp report is a joke and a clear hit on Gordon to try and make him leave that lucrative post of puplic enterpirses minister @Jabu Malinga what are they if not facts? @Dominic Przybylski wow wow that theory. do you think will that happen? that's for sure he must hide i am about to be shocked...😦 "Garry Nell is still awaiting feedback 
1:04:19,1:04:52, "@Thando Nkutha  let's consider the location of the police station + hawks he visited; Free State?? "on a serious note. can't they chnage the interpreter? Secondly But in the case of Zuma i don't believe his life is in danger. "yhooo! sad story Greg Rowles. Henry Cele played Shaka Zulu. Agree They are findings..her own biased finding which must be challenged in court just lik the court said she lied few days ago. @Buyiswa Mnyani surely i agree with you O baba must sleep with one eye open from now on........ 
1:04:55,1:06:11, @Buyiswa Mnyani It's very clear to me. Whether they succeed who knows? did I hear him saying Mkwebane was shown the video? yes Kay kay Busiswa is going down Ingaba PP uyawazi umsebenzi wakhe na? This guy is Aggrizzi (ng) uyapiqa. "The Court found the mkwebane lied and mislead "public protectors name came up again ubaba ka duduzane is in big 💩 he is a big man he have guts...but baba people can pick up your guts...be carefull 
1:06:16,1:07:17, Mkwebane is a wolf wit a sheep skin.... will the EFF march to the Hawks to toy toy... No. Bc they are crooks too. They don't give a stuff for the poor. @Jabu Malinga so lets simply wait for a court verdict and take it from there Mkwebane hides behind the Office of the PP to do all her wrong things I just feel for this guy after today he should consider buying a cap and sun glasses to b nt recognized. Unless they target his family "@rohan barnard  chairmen is shocked Mr Zondo call remember everything...he banna so that is the video or audio? 
1:07:30,1:08:11, Useless HAWKS !!!! "people mus think for themselves and don't listen to charlotins lik malema..malema was at dbn july dressed up in R150000 cloths CR is a patient man I like his approach in dealing with ZUMA ppl. The law is closing down on Zuma hence they're all over the place. My worry is I foresee civil war. we're going to rebels like in DRC i think its audio "I felt sorry for PP on Monday after the Concourt's judgement. Manje thanks fikile "@Jabu Malinga i know mkhwebane is wearing two hats ei kunzima after the dbn july he was drunk at 1am and told ppl to go home and have sex..hahahhahah..malema wena leader 
1:08:12,1:08:38, the police are also captured especially tlemeza @Buyiswa Mnyani Spot on. this is sad when people are threatened and law enforcement does absolutely nothing Mara what is the purpose of the hawks and the police mxm Hawks "Well done interpreter I see civil war soon scorpoin should come back haux are useless It a video but the guy was driving never took he's face 
1:08:42,1:09:52, "@Buyiswa Mnyani NO am confused nw "Carnoth he saim Hawks captured too "U will be killed by the same protection u r to be given @Sydney its true "Mkwebane is handled by zuma faction..she uses the smaller judgement to say  "@Greg Rowles these people have no value for a human life 
1:09:58,1:10:38, Matt....Hawks are captured no doubt the chair is very 😔 hawks were doing wat dey suppose to do as dey instructed Hawks were captured very long ago........ he said it was a video nw it audio which is which? My word What is wrong with our Police Very true captured @Greg Rowles The state is collapsing. Gangs are taking over the metros. There soon won't be enough money to pay grants to 17 million who rely on them to stay alive. Then what do you think will happen? 
1:10:41,1:11:31, "@Jabu Malinga i hear you but there could be some truth in there  South Africa Police are not a Police are Thugs mnxn SO sad guzo shuba SAPS ARE SCARED this witness is so brave it is a big problem if law enforcement does not inter act. Serious problem i think it an audio in form of a video which shows no one just voices @Dominic Przybylski we will survive; we need to have faith in our patriots! 
1:11:43,1:12:22, @Talent P Sibisi I agree with SAPS is useless it's no longer about ANC vs DA vs EFF if we want to make it Bacishe grootman @Greg Rowles Faith without a plan gets us nowhere.

1:19:33,1:21:03, If Zuma realy care for black or Zulu people he shall come to his mind to understand and publicly accept that he is the both direct & indirect cause of all of these corruption and carelessness Just think that Ace pushed for Zwane to be a chair of a Parliament committee? "We were told about the 'gangster state' With ANC in power this will never stop "@Kay Kay  I am afraid of RET eish lotaat uyacula @Antonie Goosen I agree with you Mandela was in jail for many years but he came out to be a President that's our first mistake mnxn

1:22:51,1:23:19, Mara guys will i b wrong if I label and as a criminal syndicate People were killed to appease the Guptas tjooooooo that's too bad So maybe that Louse Meyburg author is not far off... @Neo Senkge our second mistake is to put Zuma to be a President without Matric pp are killed but no arrested why Proud of this man. Ace Magashule and Zwane must go is ANC not a criminal syndicate?? 
1:23:20,1:24:16, "Eff is not a court of law. In fact @Talent P Sibisi only agree abut mistake with Zuma RET means what? so busisiwe mkhwebane is also involved by protecting Sure Ace is untouchable Hawu Mkwebane is a State capture person The estina dairy report was invalidated by a court 
1:24:16,1:25:16, @makhosi nobhatyi .... yes to JAIL Radical Economic Transformation my foot @Greg Rowles Radical economic transformation "@Beddazzled he is a native swati speaker Mkwebane protects zuma faction. dhe finds against Gordon on petty issues without evidence but does not even mention Ace in estina report..hahhahah "@Talent P Sibisi NO was it a video or an audio? @Bas Mdaka thanks Hi 
1:25:16,1:26:53, @goolamv she did not exonerate them... she chose not to investigate them.... simple Hi they are not scared Its clear from her reports that the PP is handled by zuma/gupta faction. find against our enemies and don't find against our corrupt friends "REC to loot state money "Zondo which police r u referring to Mkwebane is soon to be struck off the roll of advocates I wonder how he will perform under cross examination "@Jabu malinga don't mislead us 
1:26:59,1:27:44, constitutional court found against mkwebane. why is she stil ter? she is defying the highest court just lik parliament did in favour of zuma SAPS ARE CAPTURED DCJ's memory is on point. The station commander wont do anything cause they got the job through the same crimals command "Lungisani @Edwin Arthur in FS only?? "police is fast to intervene in house moles... but when we talk MAFIA this is all in and around FS Mkwebane must come sit her advocate behind on this chair.... 
1:27:58,1:28:51, Oh there is no doubt about that..... I think she has played her final cards though.... the pressure will increase to have dis barred and then she has fired herself from the office of the PP @goolamv yes Arthur @Talent P Sibisi I applaud any Black person who is self educated and still succeed against all odds ! I will never criticize or even try to demean my people for not having this western education. the whole country is being pillaged this is so sad 😭 to hear that people lost their lives because of greed... At first I thought the witness is Bab'u Mthethwa Police are always undermine Black people why? "@kagiso mathole  greed is a sin. 
1:29:32,1:30:07, jokes for some people money is more worth than a life of someone else @Neo Senkge what's I can say is ANC is playing with us since Mandela I hope the EFF are going t help her fund her R900k legal costs bill This is so scary "High court rules PP report on Vrede was unconstitutional.. lugisani the station commander must be arrested immediately "Who mkhwebane is protecting if she failed to protect these people? Nowonder why are allowing these Politicians to ruined our lives "Mkwebane shouldn't only be struck off the advocates roll 
1:30:14,1:30:57, facts are your friend.. stop listening to nonsense from malema n ace Where is Ace Magashule these days?? he has been commenting too much on other people's business now it about him and his Authorities threatening Innocent people of his own provinces Sies! "@funicanz its expected for hr to be arrogant Can you hear the sirens ...patrol is cheap "big up to the interpreter @Kabelo Katjedi ACE will be touchable. Ace will com up with som memory loss lik zuma "Viva EFF Viva....always said it that the ANC is completely corrupt and its leader's don't care about South African citizens Commission must protect him 
1:31:04,1:31:43, lawyers earn too much Busisiwe doesnt need help with her legal costs. anyone know when PP decision (from yesterday) will be made? The State is the enemy - they cannot protect him from themselves ! "Ace deny deny retract retract..order..please leave d house @Awe ness Am asking my self and u can go anywhere but Black people are nothing and they don't care There's a lot of ineptness in police stations that's why crime and political crimes will never be solved. You have policemen colluding with corrupt politicians like Zwane true peter lourgh myburg must also testify because he have more evidence than mr dlamini Funicanz i cannot wait myself.....she thinks she is Gods gift to that office......an apple doesnt fall far from a tree... 
1:31:43,1:32:22, "@carnoth ngomane  all this accusations towards zuma is because he plan to get a new wife. wiNdoda Zondi ngiyakuvuma "He says the police "Greg @ Kay Kay I feel so sad how people from Bloemfontein support Ace Magashule when he was accused of corruption 100 % Antonie @Minoctar Sithole that will become a racial circus; everyone will turn it into a race issue @Simphiwe Mkhatshwa Thx
