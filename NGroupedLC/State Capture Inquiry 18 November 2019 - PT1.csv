29:32,35:26, I curse Polokwane ANC conference because it's results nearly collapsed this country "It's worth your time to listen to this man I think the devil works for the Guptas I bet the Guptas are watching this for sure "I find it curious that he seems to have intimate knowledge of their methods. But ke We are nearly to close down the options of Zuma and Guptas now we will get them The intricacies and complexities of this or in the grand scheme of things are so fascinating. Stunning cooperation and cohesion from multiple parties who's this man 
35:43,37:50, yes it interesting indeed 1.5 trillion lost @ Mchunu this man take time to investigate them with assistance from whistleblower @Bianca ok... He's gt a British accent... whats his role in State Capture... Peter Hain w @makhosi nobhatyi I will give him the benefit of the doubt for now. Although I would like to know how he accumulated his wealth at some point. If you follow the independent reporters overseas you will see how Russia and China are sweeping the middle east and Africa to grab uranium and oil and governments and banks and intelligence enable. Bitcoin is the future of money exchange and will negate the controle that Bank have. Amen. He headed up the organisation HART during Apartheid 
37:54,39:44, he is a former uk minister "i don't trust any white person who live in britain born in Kenya and grew up here in SA before they left to UK ok This foreigner has recolonized the rot going on in this country by Government officials. Our own people could not see this. They were too blinded by the millions flying into their faces "The biggest payen in the ars of the old National Government. Cricket Rugby etc thapelo I trust white people Tapelo get help for your colour priblrm "Thelsa 
39:46,41:34, @Siyabonga Mchunu..... he accumulated his wealth in the UK.... you sound like a EFF voter problem "he knew about these things but did nothing at that time that looks must see a doctor fast "thapelo If you own bitcoin you have the power of a Bank and nobody controle Bitcoin. @Robert Russell Stop being childish. I am merely pointing out that somebody with such an intimate knowledge of how these dodgy financial systems work arouses some level of suspicion himself. Thapelo get your facts right before you attempt to spin things did corruption start with zuma 
41:50,44:11, "\Yip he has.... all the way back to the 1960""s @elaine norris" "He is not a South African. He is a British citizen. He was only born in South Africa. He went to the UK from South Africa as a teenager "Tapelo thapelo yes it started with Zuma actually he is the bible of corruption "No "If you are born here you are a South African "we can't talk about anything in this country and not include race Trust and charitable foundations are often the most effective funnels for illicit financial flows. Lord Peter Hain is involved in many of those. I am just curious as to why he is here... thats why this country will remain in the poverty it is in because of people with your bad attitude Thapelo 
44:12,46:19, Why do we have a Brit testifying? what was his role in State Capture? i think he's here to fulfill 'the plan' that uBaba was talking about Thapelo you are becoming a negative energy this morning "Tapelo "Yes we can "I agree Elvis He was born in Nairobi Kenya. This guy didn't have to give up his time and come here for us!! "@Elvis Malakoane  elvis carry on u at least have your head screwed on well done 
47:09,48:49, again Elvis u are soo right well done and thank u "The moment he mentioned HSBC and Standard Chartered thanks Raymond "Sorry Thapelo some people don't understand the effects of corruption in this country and are still trying to cover for ubaba kaduduzane. yes corruption did not start with zuptas yet they have escalated corruption Is this racism nonsense necessary or is it just being ventilated to irritate and/or frustrate us folks who are interested in the testimony? what woo pastor j you are quite the only reason this guy came here is because JZ didn't take orders from britain like some of our puppet leaders 
48:51,51:35, The amount generalization here is shocking!! Why are you guys attacking Thapelo agreed Pastor J @Elvis Malakoane ....Watching and listening. Will respond at the right time bro> "Eliot because he is attacking us Thapelo must be blocked. racism it acceptable. sharp pastor j "@Person of interest  "Racism unacceptable. sorry 
51:44,54:04, "Thapelo just listen first and then comment whether negative or positive dont block him... engage him... tolerate those who hold a different view "I don't tolerate idiots i guess at the end of the day is still a witness in a state capture. "every country in the world that has shares in this country "Thapelo lol Sir Elliott it's not a different view it's straight dumbest view Please let us stop insulting each other 
54:14,1:02:00, "James Godloza Godloza ​ I think you are correct... if we just listen to each other and give each other a chance to talk "the problem @Person of interest you leak information Thapelo blocked sorry @Noxolo we should just call a spade a fork @Leizl Eykelhof please 🙏🏾 @james calling a spade a shovel or spade is neither here nor there... you aught to always reflect your best humanity to the world... this guy is a member of parliament in England... how is he linked to state capture... En jou punt is ???? "Even banks in South Africa (Stander bank) wont help you if you were swindled and money payed in to the crooks account 
1:02:21,1:06:38, @Elneamo.... he doesn't have a point "Yes "@ Eliot Chauke he done investigation with international bank how money flow @redriger ✌🏿✌🏿danki The real capture is happening as we speak!! This Gupta one is a smoke screen. Makhosi danki "Easy D exactly @ Stronger togather.. Yes a new one to me also @ Person of interest.. 
1:07:36,1:10:13, bull! "@ Eliot Chauke thanks bro @Stronger together .....so are you on the square? "I know this is @Charel Gmail ...Absolutely agree with you. But...I chose to ignore some of the nonsense. Tom Moyane Oeps Moyane! Oom Tom was an Iceboy 😂😂they were telling him what to do "Stronger together 
1:10:17,1:12:15, @Stronger together ....Please take your nonsense elsewhere and dont impose it or yourself on decent and intelligent people. If you cant then just whisper to yourself. Pleeeeeeeez Better to ignore some of these ignorant comments I am not surprised why they hate Gordhan so much because he caught them @makhosi LOL Deep state independent reporter uncovering global crookery in intelligence. makhosi yes he was very close African National Criminals... African National Corruption... African National Charlatans... makhosi u are soo well advertised to this thank u soo much proof is all that matters .... 
1:13:01,1:15:43, "Do not forget this is a British Politician it explains why Zuma was nervous and removed Gordhan when he was in England it explains Des Van rooyen weekend special "its easy to spot a smere campaign. If som1 is accused of stealing and another of giving som1 early pension Lord Peter Hain anti-apartheid campaigner in the 1970s. @Eliot Chauke ...AN Crooks @Sthakathi Please... "I recommend George Webb for the bigger fraud picture and capture of oil pipelines Tjoo guys I am the one who stands for Gordhan in support of his work to clean up the state but Zuma allies has sweet mouths to blind people that they were fighting for us which is not true it there system they know it 
1:15:53,1:18:18, "there is maybe 20 or less "Pravin hired David Mabuza who has since made a loss of 25billion and counting under a year at Eskom I love the block function "when this guy goes back to britain mbulelo so mbulelo you say Zuma is stupid he was taught corruption he was not born a thief "@Mbulelo Maquba ...And who taught Zuma that the ""shower"" prevents HIV and AIDS?" Bingo Pastor 🙏😂 "Lord Peter Hain who?..the amout of insight knowledge this old man from Enland has for our country for me its kinder awkward and scary "@ pastor J 
1:18:19,1:20:57, Pravin is the one who enabled state capture... he was Fund Raiser in Chief during CR17 campaign... all ANC policies wont be implemented because of Jamnandas "@Mbulelo Maquba please don’t just jump inside the pool without seeing how safe you are if you do not understand politics you will say that . @Easy D ....I use most of the silly comments to brighten my day. I dont understand some of these people. hahahahahaha "Thapelo any zuma supporters here??? well it helps and the comment was accurate..@ Pastor J pastor j their bosses knew this man is coming here today so they bought them data to come and disturb but it won't work "@ Mbulelo Maquba I am well informed brother 
1:21:20,1:26:20, @Arnie Naidoo ...The trolls are easy to identify. All their comments are a reflection of a Grade 2or 3 education pastor j amen to that we are not Zuma supporters we are black transformation people it happen Zuma is a lead @redriger ...She was toooo drunk to be teaching anyone @Mbulelo Maquba ....You have not answered my question yet "We must agree all ubaba Zuma wenze kabi ukusebenzisana nalaba bantu you are blocking him to transform Africa . ramaposa is not corrupt The only problem Zuma did was to work against white capital.. look at Dudu Myeni right now. She is being blamed for things done by Colemen Andrews at SAA 
1:26:22,1:29:12, stronger that is if they can read bossa guys "...And who taught Zuma that the ""shower"" prevents HIV and AIDS? @Mbulelo Maquba" Zumpie army making their final stand even after a bloodied defeat BCS he is white in a black skin Sthakathi Khumalo now were did you read this rubbish Zuma used white capital as a smoke screen to steal money from the poor to enrich himself and his cronies. And some people praised him. "@Sthakathi Khumalo with all respect but you are not making any sense now Go google Bain and Coleman Andrews!! 
1:30:00,1:37:39, Go look at Hawks dossiers clearing Dudu and stop looking at certain media narratives and taking them as facts Sthakathi then why does Dudu not come testify at the commission if she is innocent? She is hiding Sthakathi Khumalo now how did you get hold of the HAWKS files "Corruption has no colour v what is happening here is not fight against corruption but showing that certain people should not be corrupt only those who really have the power. yes those are the ones that should be prosecuted too Peter Staffen Just go and read. SAA owns c. 9 planes & lease 60 planes! dossier clears Dudu Myeni & directly implicates former SAA’s American turn around strategist Coleman Andrews implicating states 
1:39:20,1:42:58, "Sthakathi Khumalo and somebody is getting rich on the leases that were signed  "@ Sthakathi Khumalo remember Hawks you are taking about was captured example many business owners and in SA are involved in Criminal tax avoidance this is what im talking about makhosi nobhatyi well said Peter Staffen Who is getting richer?? @Sthakathi Khumalo Only one dodgy publication published about that dossier in 2018. There is no such dossier. makhosi nobhatyi Funny enough same investigation was done by a French investigating body which investigated competition and corruption in the airline industry. Thats where the evidence came from @makhosi nobhatyi Hawks did not release such a dosier. Sthakathi Khumalo please use the brain cell you have got 
1:42:59,1:49:49, I like how the witness refers to the guptas as criminals One of the Guptas houses was auctioned this morning for 2.6 million. "There is nothing done in the dark part of the plan "@Sthakathi Khumalo ...Clearly our Authorities could not deal with Corruption and State Capture hence the help that we need from others to bring these criminals "redriger They have protectors like Trevor "Sthakathi KhumaloYou may not born to remember this history - Peter Hain was an activist against the apartheid government Thanks to the people who came up with technology so that we can able to see truth unfolding. "Pastor J The problem is that these facts seem to chase one person 
1:50:00,1:55:11, "Sthakathi "Hendrine de Wet Struggle credentials do not scare us Whats in it for them in African countries thats the point.. You never see us investigating them Meddling? He's helping us to track our money and bring it back! Hey @Bianca Arnold @Bianca Arnold 😃 He must also help us bring back the many gold stollen by the QUEEN!!

1:56:59,1:58:49, "redriger "@Jeffrey Kangara Peter Hain I fail to see why Peter Hain is explaining to the commission how State Capture worked and who was responsible. He has said that he has gleaned his knowledge from public sources. There is nothing new. "I have missed out on the past 30 minutes. Any big corporate names dropped yet? Beyond Standard Chartered @Pastor J Not excluding anyone except those who loot our taxes of ZAR. They don't love this country at all... "David Tuer we have been saying the but seems we are hallucinating Ain't no doubt. they just wanna mess around ...Thats all @Pastor J @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU ...You are tooo kind. I think you meant the entire ANC leadership @Bianca Arnold. He says not. 
1:58:55,2:02:12, @Jeffrey Kangara Its Peter Hain "Zondo must call Nomula Makonyane "@Pastor J Eish "@Bianca Arnold Mr Hain told us about the danger we're in what about stienhof mr peter what what "redriger Why is the Chair so mute today? that are getting kickbacks from shell companies dtc ok boomer

"The Guptas is using the money in the suitcase Bianca. He is talking about a generalised view of corruption. The commission is about State Capture of South Africa. "sorry "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU steinhof has so many companies under it's belt "@Bianca Arnold Unfortunately the corrupt were starting to be enticed with milk and meat "Sthakathi Khumalo I don't see him being here as wanting to scare anyone. As he said between Guptas and Rupert who are the biggest looters 
2:04:27,2:06:59, "some people just comment here "@Bianca Arnold and also ...another disease during Zuma era Rupert Thapelo Motabogi That is so true! "Sthakathi Khumalo I believe that he is still wanting to help all of us setting our country on the right path "@Thapelo Motabogi nO way i can entertain an adult that compares a firm and a country...

"@Bianca Arnold In case the ANC cadres don't fight for tenders at the expense of our country. it'll now take us ten years to be were we were at No elite goes to jail in this country.. but only the poor "sounds like this guy is here to tell zondo commission what to do "UK that @redriger Hahaha...sick leave indeed ... 
2:14:02,2:17:25, Can we move to another witness now!! @redriger I should not laugh... it pains me to think about it please @Thami Ngwenya South African exchange controls must have approved this transaction? Ask them for the details why this money was allowed to leave Standard Bank account? @Thando Nkutha Spot on! "Guess he was on sick leave "@ Keith Sindile "@Easy D At least in the U.S. 
2:18:06,2:23:57, Name those people man...arghhh "So Here we hear none in jail Makes me sick Peter was invited to speak on asset recovery. Nigeria had to get help to recover oil money. We also need help. Don't know if NPA can cope with the Gupta tip of the iceberg. @redriger Miracles recovery indeed.. maybe Zuma had magic cause Shabbir was his piggy bank back then i cannot understand why the Guptas haven't been extradited. And as Lord Hain says the government must get the stolen money back to SA. ASAP. Lorna Kavanagh which government? we dont have one. "@Bianca Arnold Gosh 
2:24:14,2:29:59, They are in Dubai. "@Bianca Arnold Thats a problem "@Lorna Kavanagh Oh yeah "@Bianca Arnold and i tell you...
