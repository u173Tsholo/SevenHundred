1:02:33,1:04:38, Precious I agree "if you see crime u report it @ precious I agree I agree Precious @lerato masemula I respectfully disagree with you Lerato. There was corruption then and also the brutality of the system. Ace doesn't allow thinkers as allies. you would be chastised to the latter. dukwana has forever been vocal and resolute. thina here in the aFree State know this for sure. hence Ace fired him Precious Nkoga- Well diagnosed - DNA and it will not change >>>>>. @Wilelm Petrus thanks. @ lerato you clearly have no knowledge of what our people went through during the apartheid era 
1:05:03,1:08:09, thanks @Marvin Mahlangu We might be witnessing the fall if the Ace of spades.I am sure alot of ppl in bfn will be hapoy he has really just used ppl for self enrichment.fs is suffering because of him..dukwana aint scared Ace is something else "Most Of Our Officials They Don't Care About The well-being Of Our Citizens "Off course there was corruption in the previous regime. There was also two ministers jailed for corruption. The sin of apartheid was very bad "i grew up in an asbestos house in a white suberb and there were private houses as well do not go to the narritive that this was an apartheid thing Mpando yes they must act now otherwise more accident going to happen using this for pocket money for ace do white people think they have done enough for Black South Africans?

But i'm of the opinion that blacks who are in key positions ; abusing resources meant for the poor must receive harsher punishments Victim becomes persecutor !!! @Salmaan Abrahams I totally totally agree with you i dnt take council from privileged whites Can someone call Ace to come forward we need explanation plz inequality and corruption from government officials are the one impending us. @Thando Nkutha Very well observed and noted my friend. Totally and fully agree with the sentiments 
1:13:52,1:16:13, iyoooo generalising @Godfrey Motlele I agree! Imagine thousands of small business companies supported by an honest government. SA could fly and provide all we need....not want. "@Mpondo LakuNoxova Ace wont come. he saw what happened to his mentor Baba ka duduzane. look this is not about people who can't this is about greed and the extended family and the culture of certian people "when there is WMC i agree lets fight it  @Thando Nkutha I also have that perceived reputation to uphold in my communication with you so You will notice the effort to ensure correctness.

Derek i agree even DA is the better devil "@Makwa Choma that will be great thats not civilian oversght yes thats MP's overseeing other MP's 
1:35:50,1:37:29, @Mashamba Davhana these leaders when they are in the corner they will mention these business people throwing them to the mud to shift focus so I remain firmly those who steal on us must be in jail @Concerned South African The problem with Parliament is that the Concourt found them in dereliction of their duties. How can that clown circus lead us? "we cant jst let white people to tell Us who is our heroes @Gee Peex1 did you sleep well?knowing that you are the product of usurpers ?

Restore the dinosaurs! you must want the majority to be free from the shackles of poverty "@Sindiswa Moolman  
2:15:40,2:17:36, @Salmaan Abrahams That's what we expected the ANC govt to deal with. They chose to line their pockets instead. So he is not innocent. That's given. but you dnt deserve equality @Ryan Smith But he said it was transport money. I suspect he got more than that... before the R10K @funicanz "@Derek Main i agree  @Ryan Smith deserves equality Why are you called or named Ryn not Thokazi??? please respond @Ryan Smith did your parents apply to government and wait 25 years for an rdp house? give the land back to its rightful owners khoisan people

Maybe the white brasse do the paperwork better "@Thando Nkutha How am I supporting racism? I'm not saying the apartheid we have now is identical to what it was previously but right now Mna would @Ryan Smith. "@Thando Nkutha  "@Ryan Smith 100%  
2:33:12,2:34:29, Eeeesh...this race thing.....is really pulling us ALL down...... penny apartheid has nothing to do with this @Derek Main have you seen a sign saying blacks only? so interesting @Thando Nkutha I know I'm not racist - I couldn't care less if you called me one. its not about the job its about accountability I've seen lots of job adverts saying blacks only "@Derek Main has your parents been made to address a black child as ""baas""?" @Salmaan Abrahams Please see my reply to Thando - I never said the situations are identical - only that whotes are now unfairly discriminated against based on skin colour. 
2:34:40,2:36:45, @Jack Sparrow LIES beeeeee @Salmaan Abrahams .........Seems you been brainwashed by da ANC....right Bra... "@Thando Nkutha @Salmaan Abrahams - If you can't see that "@Thando Nkutha  For me @Raven Penny... it’s about the jobs and whether they can deliver to all SAns. We have enough institutions that can hold them accountable. @Derek Main it only seems so because we look from where we at not how we came here @Jack Sparrow ....isn't that Racist........ "@Salmaan Abrahams I have no issue with restitution and agree that it must happen. However 
2:37:03,2:38:52, So who are the Racists now.........thought we were over that ..... @MIKE LOCK there are currently more racist laws in the country than there were in the apartheid days @Derek Main this is an unfortunate predicament but those kids are still born into an advantage brought about by apartheid @Ruan Niemann 34 @Salmaan Abrahams ...Shame Bra...can see you bitter and twisted....Get Over It Bra........live going forwards.....it's the Only way...ne.. @Salmaan Abrahams So you are justifying unfair discrimination based on race. That's what apartheid was. "that's what we did in '94 @Ryan Smith. well at least the blacks did yes abel "People in america are also ""born into advantage"". Let's destroy them all" 
2:38:57,2:41:09, @Ruan Niemann one does not need to be old to learn objectively i thought so. virtue signalling social justice warrior greedy for what you can get. Thabo Manyoni when is coming to testify? Racism in any form is hurtful and shameful. Indulging in racism is equally shameful. Discussing the impact of racism is another issue altogether but must be constructive and progressive. But Salmaan.......You don't seem to be Learning......ne @Derek Main im saying that the majority do not have the most basic amenities and those who are born into advantage still wants to cry fowl at an attempt to rectify you all fighting each other while the employees of government are stealing peoples future and each time they want to divert attention they push the race thing. start focusing on good and bad. i get on with all people who take responsibility for their own lives. @Jack Sparrow they dont say designated...they say disadvantaged papi 
2:41:10,2:43:17, @Pastor J well said "Madiba was a lawyer @Ruan Niemann ...well said Bra.... @Michael Wild hopefully we not fighting nut engaging eachother "No is there only two races in sa BEE Laws identify all South africans excluding white men as previously disadvantaged. @Salmaan Abrahams My problem is that you try to paint all whites with the same brush. There are many whites who want exactly what you want - that poverty should be dealt with. That is racist. Some of us will do anything to make sure that our kids get the best education. The question to all involved ... the Morakes and then now is whether it was worth it.

No. Just everyday government work:) @Rajen Chetty i'm not gonna give them money if they don't provide a service IF YOU ONLY TAKE CLIENTS MONEY AND DONT PAY CLAIMS YOU WILL BE IN BUSINESS FOR LIFE

I WAS ONE OF THEM UNTIL I HAVE MOVED OVER TO MOMENTUM Mr Dukwana will face the same fate as Gavin I think he will be protected now. I don’t think Ace thought he was a risk to him @Ewald Kruger Imagine how great SA would have been if the energy and ingenuity devoted to stealing were to be used for the benefit of all South Africans. "If ANC is going to issue a brief statement on Magashule 
3:06:55,3:09:22, Right on @Wilhelm5381 "Here here WAIT TILL THIS HAPPENS TO YOU THEN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND. "Magashule has zero scruples @Luvuyo Zantsi . I so wish that the book be lifted and it makes noise like it did when it was launched. We need it back in our selves. I had had hope for SA! sad this is what it has become if this is the norm. "@Gee Peex1 Did the Guptas not take funds to Dubai There are many in the organization who were mentioned here but still in government. So it wouldn’t be consistent if the ANC to take any action against Ace @funicanz. I think we should be a bit patient "Gee Peex 1 
3:09:41,3:11:29, gangster state. Aceeeee!! "@Sindiswa Moolman  "All the VBS facilitators Mxolisi’s producing the receipts of what is covered in the Gangster State Yep Im jika majika what is the name of this book about this Ace character.

Masibe nomonde Nowonder what does the Youth league at Free state their sinuous reveals this damnning revelations coz they were too vocal attacking myburg rubbishing those things written in the book

"All cadres running bankrupt municipalities Gangster State can't wait to see the end of this commission and see what will follow next Gupta State!! one year later and no arrests... this witness must get the army to protect him and he's family after this All labor broking firms have ANC members and labor union member of their boards..wonder why labor broking is still aroung? they need to leave the county! 
3:13:43,3:15:05, I hope Shamila is watching and taking notes of evrything!! Steinhoff criminals are still enjoying the millions they stole remember angelo agrizzi was threatened at gunpoiny when he first started speaking...he still carried on..when we keep quiet about sinful wrongdoings we are just as guilty so everyone in government in SA is corrupt? i would say majority yes "Yep without a doubt agree "except these gentlemen "All ANC members who sold off JOZI 
3:15:05,3:16:19, i feel people also get bullied inyo doing this for fear of survival or lack thereof Steinhoff criminals are being charged.....major claims against them....they must go to jail! ​Gee Peex 1 has my nomination as Ace's replacement. (He will likely see this as a compliment) but no one ever go to jail really man do you have enough jails to hold them all?

Cerebis ​Steinhoff criminals are being charged.....major claims against them....they must go to jail! AGREE 100% 
3:16:24,3:17:34, "Strange whenever government corruption is mentioned "yes Ace must go they will have to make do with what they get in jail because it takes a long time to have the neccessary experience! white hair is wise! they will have to empty the prisons Actually ehat do we expect when a judiciary system is compromised... You could hear sighs of relief from Politicians when Gavin Watsons accident was announced. Why did it take the Police from 05h00 to 12h00 to get there? Also the vehicle is not supposed to be moved. The biggest loser in steinhoff was christo wiese 
3:17:47,3:19:44, It annoys me when others mention Stratcom whenever the journalists report on certain individuals @Rob Nel sho i agree with white hair that has more experience..but quite clearly they not showing any of that and he never drove Manuel @Jack Sparrow Only Alberton survived...the rest has been hijacked! this xenophobia crisis is manufactured by the ANC and its handlers! "@Jack Sparrow As a single person yes Gavin Watson suddenly dies xenophobia crisis? I must have missed something That man is alive and kicking man i might be green but i am not a cabbage 
3:20:06,3:21:18, Ufelani uMpambani lo? We need his testimony now the ANC seem to be very disturbed people! soulless or demon possessed! "the saying is 'I might be cabbage looking "2 that in every corrupt deal there is a corruptor and corruptee there is a anaconda in the grass I think the best cabbage farmer ever was Malema on the farm he lost.

I can't understand what this guy says @Mandy Pannack This is not a discussion of Afrikanner work ethics...

"Mr De Klerk asked for Forgiveness at TRT "@Gee Peex1 Yes "Mxolisi is the co-author of ""Gangster State""... Too much information 🤔🤔🤔😂" All I can say is that the Nat govt did a fine job in making SAfns hate each other. That legacy continues. They would be proud of the haters. TRC I no action has been take today after yesterday's allegations against Ace like takingbthis guy to court then he is on to something that is true. that's only in fs 
3:44:26,3:48:11, Really @ Mahlomola Mofube? It makes sense that he has all the receipts ff no penny "Tebogo @Derek Main did you see the ratio of white people occupied in management positions.... very rich to blame government "Tebogo most @Gregory Werner You are not making sense - the aim of the Nat govt would be to have more whites in management. Much in the same way that the ANC govt wants more blacks in management. ANC is = NAT. it's bad. Mr X remains as Mr X.
