time,9:13,message hope my data todae won't be misused in terms of relevant answers to b given He is already complaining. He loves his own voice. crying baby He thinks he's smart he thought he would come and sing alone complaining of wat now @reformation network SA I think Mr Manyi feels the heat and he wants to avoid any intervention from Adv.Maleka. 
9:30,10:44, But they allowed Paraffin to sing alone @lucky Molepo that Maleka was asking difficult questions and Maleka's posturing Which other witness was cross examined in the manner manyi is? Advocate Maleka is arrogant qha qwaba @Bonani Maphini Manyi was given a chance to sing now is questioning time @thato M Mrs Williams Does an Inquiry mean cross exam has to follow a prosecutorial / NPA approach? @KD Sibisi you are lying! 
10:48,12:21, Mr Manyi must just answer questions finish and klaar!!! Which witness asked to read their staemen without interruption from the evedence leader? MANYI IS A JOKE can't wait til this kangaroo witness is done @thato M one word answers sometimes required not whole sentence I thought Mr Maleka was cross examining yesterday. Now judge Zondo says the commission does not cross examin. I'm confused. "these thief must just answer finish and klaar  "Since the StateCaptureInquiry opened its doors only one person that has come up with evidence to back his testimony is MzwaneleManyi  "Manyi is correct 
12:30,14:11, "and they were never questioned Waiting for Manyi to declare lunch break Exactly Skhumbuzo "@KD Sibisi which terms of reference are you referring to? Because all those terms are binding to all this is not a party it's a court of law ⚖ why it must be easy fr him Maleka is no fool. This commission isn't his first rodeo.. he is trained to grill LIARS and paid well to do so Mr Maleka my Tuesday crush 🙋😂 Lol Lesidi "Adv. Maleka isn't a defence lawyer or prosecutor 
14:13,16:37, some people argue like this is a court of law but an Inquiry tell him advocate Nozipho struuuuuu 😁😁😁😁 I fully agree with Bronx Wavy 100% "Every other witness has been treated with kid gloves Dear Maphini-Myanyi came forward with evidence that evidence must be interrogated. @thato my misprint bt still must give us answers broe irrespective Manyi put lot of info on the table and need to be questioned "@KD Sibisi not in this manner 
16:58,18:36, "You may or may not agree with Manyi @thato m you guys dont care about the millions rand ther manyiat dissapeared und Valid concerns Manyi is raising & will put the Commission in the spotlight @Chela Brake what are you on about? Thato-how would you rather we handle this.Billions were lost and that is your best defence for Jimmy. Manyi is jst taking time Questioning in a inquisitorial manner and questioning as if one is interrogating in a bully manner should be condemned... "@Donovan Peters billions Maleka needs to be professional here 
18:45,19:31, we need answers manyi don't want Maleka now 😃😃😃😃😃😃 "their ""poetry""" manyi must just answer and stop his games Lol Manyi dnt want MaLela 😂😂😂😂😂😂 If I am dreaming why is SA considering a loan from the IMF. the chair must not allow that ecuse himself lol I thought the Judge was going to make a special announcement today about the happenings outside the commission Manyi has been giving answers and his not running away 
19:31,20:48, "Maleka is just here to defend some people not get the truth Manyi is actually questioning the credibility of Judge Zondo. He is just afraid he might incriminate himself because Maleka is no sunday school. @Donovan Peters you are dreaming. Argue better some1 ill advised manyi last night I knew my data will be wasted again He wants to continue but not with Maleka.... "Nami "If Jimmy is not lying "Maleka thinks he's representing Pravin and his crew 
20:52,21:53, It is acceptable to raise procedural fairness especially in an Inquiry @Donovan Peters who is Jimmy? Thats what happens when you decide to take sides you cant digest the truth...I am not impressed with Maleka "When we said yesterday Maleka was being unprofessional this is jst delaying tactics Thato-Jimmy Manyi. Manyi is scared of Mr Maleka.... does he want to walk away from the stand stinking of butterflies? "Maleka took sides 
21:54,22:54, Otherwise this will crush all his evidence and he wasn’t doing that bad Just like i said yesterday Mr Maleka will be on a Roll @Siyela thank you Manyi o re senyetsa nako a masepa The Biggest IDIOT HAS OVERSHADOWED THE Entire evidence and SHOCK IT with liers cause the little ones to trebles "Mzwanele is within his right to raise objections He is only seeking equal treatment. "Manyi is correct "why could a witness with none to hide 
23:02,24:20, *isn't how does manyi wants questions to be addressed on him Gounds for procedural fairness Thato it seems you argue for the sake of being argumentative. Manyi is correct and should be commended for his bravery Grounds for procedural fairness. Jimmy is in Quagmire Gupta Boy Who does he think he is why does he want to direct the commision "Bravery well done Manyi. 
24:25,25:33, @Donovan Peters that is your view and you are entitled to it. Without substanting you are just wasting your data there is no place for sissies in this whole thing... Bravery its a joke Manyi is making this thing a mockery. "Manyi flopped here what's so difficult with Maleka stepping down and hand over the cross examination to his colleagues? is manyi broke? he wants access to pro bono legal services "Maleka represents vested interests Yeh or Nay 
25:37,26:35, "manyi must not come here and try to dictate to the commission Maleka is on the right path ulixoki Manyi thts y engamfuni Maleka Manyi is afraid of Maleka period @Donovan Peters I overestimated Thato's intelligenvce Manyi thought recusal is as simple as that. Now he realizes that it is not that easy. you cant question the credibility of a lawyer and not be expected to motivate in writing. I'm a self taught lawyer with no degree can i represent Manyi please 🙋🏾😬 he will get same questions from anyone else...whats the point?? "As I said yesterday-This not about defending BEE/Township owned businesses 
26:36,27:39, @vincent kolobe Manyi must just respond. he is used to dictating judge Zondo is treading carefully becuase he realises this may be deemed critical later. An accused person has rights. Some here are talking about sissies 😀😀 Ena aya kwini.He should just have kept quiet and ignore what was said about him because now he is exposed manyi must just ask himself n answers at the same time as he wishes juju Give another evidence leader and we continue "other people came to the inquiry with Shifting the conversation Maleka is a beast💪💪💪 
28:04,28:56, Recuse yourself Maleka - let others ask the questions. You are biased towards Manyi. No other witness has been treated this way Affidavit Manyi Maleka Poetry-you must have missed a few classes at school. u ppl r nutty. Many I is like the Hlaudi of business.. with a matric @Lesedi Adv Maleka is a real beast. He does it with a smile Yes i did Donovan I remember Manyi yesterday said i will be here 7 O'Clock 😂😂😂😂😂 Ena aya kwini manyi* zondo yadika naye sometimes 
29:17,30:31, Maleka thinks this is a court of law where he is representing a certain faction/side which is obviously in this case Pravin and his lackeys @Lesedi he thought it was a joke Would have love to attend your school. Maleka has a negative posture towards Manyi ayizojika lonto....He is captured "@Bronx Wavy what about Ivan Pillay who headed SARS without Matric uZondo nale kindness yakhe naye manniiii "@tshepo Mahlangu I also feel u "Zondo stance is correct The treatment given to Manyi is completely different from that given to Gordhan. Well done Manyi for pointing that out..... 
30:40,31:17, KD 😂😂😂😂 🏃 ena aya kwini maleka must recuse himself. Maleka is bias and everyone can see that he is pushing a certain agenda. Maleka lacks professionalism and impartiality. You could see Maleka threading carefully against Gordhan. "This Commission is a mockery "Jimmy thought he would move on red carpet @Tshepo Mahlangu uZondo ulokhu engingiza into engekho jimmy knows he bit off more than he can chew. But I still think Justice Zondo is a wrong person for this commission go shota fela Manyi a idibale 
31:28,32:07, this will take 10 yrs "Even if Maleka recuses himself "Take lessons from Zuma Maleka is just being a bully. Let the other candidate take over! Manyi has bullied him qha Maleka was cross examining period. Judge Zondo has just made it clear the commission does not cross examine. Maleka must recuse himself. Zondo said Malima instead of saying Malika HE MUST EATEN LOT OF JUJUB Eh Eh eh Ai Zondo But ADv. Maleka was not the evidence leader during Pravin Gordhan's cross-examination... adv Maleka made history today😂😂😂 
32:29,33:23, @Siyela Mkhabele Are you calling @trucker an idiot? thato... Manyi is trying to cast aspersions on the commission because he is effectively alleging that the chairperson is unable to take control of proceedings were a witness to be treated unfairly. This Maleka fellow and his fake twang is over rated! Manyi is running away wth evidence Thats for sure Lesw next witness pls data is very expensive "Pravin was treated with kid's gloves and even assisted during his memory lapses @Bonani Maphini and nobody has been so evadive 
33:27,33:51, "If Manyi is not satisfied with the next person cross examining him Mr Manyi volunteered to be a witness now he's crying foul. If he has all the facts why should Adv Maleka recuse himself wasting tax payers money mxm "VIVA MALEKA VIVA if you put it that way. how can you compare with Gordan? The like s of Manyi like to muddy the water-Speaking about black business while the Guptas were never even SA born. "This is not a court @Lesedi yes he made history by cross examining a witness at a commission. This is not a court. Maleka is FBI Agent 
33:56,35:07, Besides Pravin is still coming back to present evidence as well. Manyi was not asked questions the 1st time round as well... @Bonani because EVERYONE knows jimmy is a corruption player Manyi is running away "Mapholoba Maleka is hurt 😀😀😀 advocate Maleka telling the truth "Many I is a criminal Mr Maleka has so much patience. Manyi is defending the self 
35:11,36:19, The law vs Politics Khawuyeke Mzwandile mannniii yekaaaa Manyi!! Manyi! Beautfiful arguments. This is the same attitude I see at the Nugent Commission by the way manyi does not need lawyers his representing himself again listen to this guy... studied at the Pile Mabe Zizi Kodwa Malusi school for Spin-doctoring First witness to get hostile cross examination. Well stated Manyi! this manyi is a skelm Javas akere Zondo ke Monna wa mosamareya o utlwela manyi botlhoko "@Callistus Khathali also the first witness to be cross examined 
36:19,37:22, Die man praat strond but Zondo is no playing his part maan We don't care even if it is not a court of law we wan't ppl to pay.Thato Manyi seek Affidavit to defend himself AGAINST FBI AGENT Maleka TOUGH ON TOUGHNESS Why does Manyi want to be treated special?? @lucky molepo he's weak Zondo ke Monna wa mosamareya mxm Many I is a ho I can now see the Zuptas have no reason to fear this commission. smh Zuma can easily run this show 
37:32,38:10, @Donovan Peters you don't care but the Deputy Chief Justice is and therefore standing the matter down because of its seriousness. It matters little what you think. Substance over emotions why is he talkig about the evidence now? "@Thato M "I repeat I feel like Judge Zondo is being too sympathetic here...this will set a bad trend for the next witnesses. @KD Sibisi Zondo is too weak maan "Manyi is calling for fairness Jimmy wants to chair the commission now Zondo his degenerating this house 
38:13,39:14, this Manyi is explaining to the chair. about Mr. Maleka as if the chair was not there. this guy things he is thee guy. ZONDO must also step down Substance-What substance have you displayed in this debate? "can we move on to another witness please Now he us giving evidence about city press.Manyi is continuously in plating himself after asking recusal of Maleka KD i agree Be careful Manyi for what you're asking for. What may come way may be more than what you're facing. Zondo must go with Manyi m tired Manyi wants to lead the Commission now 😂😂😂😂 
39:18,39:47, "Zondo doesn't know his task "He's looking for pity gestures "@Tshepo Mahlangu impartiality *Enter Omotoso's lawyer taking 20 minutes to ask just one question Zondo is too soft on this Clown Many has a lot to hide. yesterday he said he didn't see all witnesses testify but today he says he's the first witness to be cross examined like this. How does he know he's the first one? @lesedi he's wasting time n resources this will take 10yrs to be resolved if Zondo behaves like this "Mnxm look at this guy 
39:58,41:02, Manyi is testifying about City press...this guy 😂😂 Why didn't Maleka cross examine Ms Mentor when she sat for days to tell us about gold plated taps and self flushing toilets. Clearly Manyi was treated differently and that in itself is wrong. "ज्योतिष से संबंधित सुच्चा मोती "I am losing trust on Zondo "Maleka should just give his notes to whoever's going to replace him lol and they will blame Julius wen he tells them they r weak Viva Maleka he crushed Jimmy in the first quarter of evidence Zondo mmmmmmm .........mmmmmmmmmmm 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ Zondo must step down 
41:03,41:33, Nguban lo ubhala schina apha em D​-Witnesses can calle back if need be. "Lol forget Sophia "People are losing trust in the Deputy Chief Justice why are we debating about our land here. lets take it bk Hands up for Maleka!!! "@em D precisely the point here. Manyi has a point WHRE ARE THEY GOING??? DCJ is just allowing Manyi to exercise his right 
41:36,42:15, zondo is weak we not going nowhere here Zondo has Democracy mentality I JUST CAME Zondo knows Maleka crosses the line. Maleka just stand this one down For the sake of the country. Manyi will be caught eitherway Bonani why? Maleka is very critical I believe he knows what he is doing zondo is weak ku shushu e'kommission Thato-Ppl-speak for yourself. holly lady 1000 resumes 10h15 
42:26,43:11, Evidence given provoke their own questioning. is manyi talking to his lawyer now "Heads up to Manyi OH OK THANKS KD Manyi doesn't have legal representative I hated Manyi since his days at BMF. And his loud and arrogant laughter is so annoying. "@guru ji Jyotish Kendra हमारे देश में हमें गंभीर समस्याएं हैं और आप गहने और चीजें बेचना चाहते हैं। दुबई में गुप्त के साथ जांचें many thought this was going to be gupta TV interview He is alone. taking Maleka and the entire legal team to legal school again 
43:22,44:16, money is being wasted for nonsensical delaying tactics get that indian language out of here the guy manyi is arrogant I thought Zondo was firm like Mogoeng!! my 45 min data wasted yeeeeeeeeer 😴🤓 Maleka will finish you off!!! Thato-It must be sad being you. HOW WERE THE CAMERS STOLEN FROM HERE I DO NOT GET THIS We know who's assassin is Maleka. We are not confused. 
44:18,45:43, "Even if they decide Maleka must agree hence they even steal cameras in this room. People do as they wish @Bronx he's the weakest link Whats Manyi clearing now. yesterday questions? Jimmy stole the commission. he is invited back "Even id they decide Maleka should continue Jimmy Manyi is a joke "@Thato M Im not getting pictures 
46:05,46:36, "If you have nothing to hide Manyi was advised by his lawyers last night to derail Maleka before it got worse with him. Clever but self destructing move. The next evidence leader will grill him even worse ... They always say ppl who are loud try to drown out others without any concrete evidence but speculation. manyi was not ready for todae hence yesterday he's ask r we not finishing todae n Advocate Maleka laughed chair I hv only touched the tip of the iceberg Claiming he is not treated like others is surprising since he has not been following some of the processes🤔 A lay man is supposed to be able to make presentations without legal representative. Maleka is arguing from a legal stand not taking the entirety of the Commissions work into considerations STEALING OF CAMERS IS A TECTIC BY THE ANC be wants to protect Zupta let him come testify for themselves or himself whatever suits them Zuptas Mmmmmm....

Jimmy is a walking ANN7 Manyi did not want Maleka since yesterday. You could see he ignored him yesterday Sometimes I wonder whether you are being paid for all the viel you sphew.

1:07:21,1:10:14, So your issue is the approach? and what yardstick has been used to test this approach ukuthi it is either Inquisitorial or presecutorial? is it because Manyi doesn't like Maleka? @Thato M "Maleka just lost the plot here kuboooo "@Tshepo Mahlangu that's like saying a test for any particular group of people must change on admission of another.

1:26:59,1:29:28, Jimmy Manyi is another poet here "@Tshepo Mahlangu I see. Yes can the inquiry start pls deputy chief Justice ⚖ 😀😁🤣 I would be surprised if the EFF takes this lying down. those who live in glass house may as well as answer the door bell. Manyi take heed mfowethu. Also remember what Mogoeng Mogoeng said over the weekend. thando we have our priorities mixed up is all im saying Manyi should get his legal team to question those who gave evidence if he thinks they were lying or making up stories. 
1:29:32,1:31:29, Manyi may be wrong but this Maleka guy is misbehaving. DCJ is dabbling in politics. This is a problem. Is it the responsibility of the chair meant to preside over the Commission to do this? "Government venues not suitable for this inquiry DCJ was there a bidding process to acquire the building? As is government process? It is true government should use government properties. Viva DCJ VIVA! DCJ has the right to comments on the goings on makshube.. Couldn't this statement by the DCJ be handled by the commission's communication team? 
1:31:37,1:32:32, Oh so Manyi did an about turn? This is fodder for the EFF. DCJ legal analysts are throwing him under the bus. It can't be. That the commisisons pays millions on rent. It can't be my crush Mr Maleka continue Mr. Manyi is back?😂😂😂 Maleka is a monster Interrogator "To us the broad public Welcome back Adv Maleka.

1:32:46,1:33:36, The beef is there. 2 bulls in a kraal!! LULU ubuyile @Chela Brake 😂😂😂😂 Again Manyi came unprepared LOL Now what this guy doing what he did earlier on?? Was he testing the pillar of this commission? Or just a publicity stunt? Take him on mr maleka wa tella "Manyi is not the only person who went home and reflect on yesterday's proceedings! Maleka also went home I am late who adviced manyi to come back security guys 
1:33:38,1:34:35, "Recuse I hear that Manyi cant stand the heat netcare 😁😂😂😂 i see selective heat sekathini kanti manje uMzwandile?

2:15:06,2:16:40, lol mechanical His not smart and exposes himself as liability to his handlers Thato! You can't generalise about which testimony is correct or wrong. Some aspects might be correct or incorrect from both sides. Just listen and draw conclusions at the end. Gwede going to deny everything been said there.😀😁😁😁 This Manyi guy likes explaining himself a lot than giving straight answeres when required.😂 Mantashing the return baba... Very defensive this Manyi Bra... @Mkhululi Bushula absolutely. Maleka seems to have come with predetermined views which Manyi obliterated. yes not every process s a yes or No... 
2:16:43,2:17:50, Guys who will be leading Gwede with questions? A honest person would not carry on like this!!!!!! "He answered this A chap by the name Mokoena Why he's so defensive? 🤔 HE WAS GIVEN AN EXAM PAPER BEFORE HAND BUT FAILS TO ANSWER THE EXAMS QUESTIONS STILL Manyi is on Top of His game.

Why @KD....Beginning to wonder as well... maleka wont win with manyi Many must just answer honorably Zondo is not been neutral he is leaning more to Mr Manyi's side.... 
2:20:18,2:21:10, Manyi They should've challenged on law and process NOT comparison. It appears to me that Zondo is defending Manyi. FACTS!!!! "of course when someone is doing sothing not on your agenda DCJ is workikg slow so that due process is followed rather slow than fast and then important aspects are overlooked. Establishing the facts - Maleka Witnessses have rights. People are so misinformed. It is a basic right ae ae ae ae ae zondooooo 
2:21:16,2:22:00, no one in SA gives Jimmy business other than Gupta. his career and professional image is done like a used condom Ohhhhhhhh Maleka again on Williams... Eish Mr. Maleka's pronunciation of words are quite weird "Manyi which VBS he dismendle Where are his rights being trampled? This inquiry is now being weakened as Manyi has captured the Chair. But Maleka is not deterred ... Maleka FIRE🔥🔥 LOL Maleka thinks he is Lumumba manyi has a pride ... this cant be tolerated 
2:22:12,2:22:42, LOL silence... Somebody claimed DCJ is protecting Manyi. Their dislike for Manyi clouds their objectivity. Zondo's education was funded by Indian guy VBS WHA....WHE....SO WHERE ARE WE AT NOW????? Zondo is captured by Manyi. But Maleka strong enough to be captured! Zondo for the first time rethinks the legal theory of the Commission..... manyi is exposing white collar crime confidence... @thando cezula Somebody claimed DCJ is protecting Manyi. Their dislike for Manyi clouds their objectivity.

2:24:11,2:25:08, fire fire fireeeee Wasting time WHEN DID YOU MAN ANSWER we need more clarity on VBS LOAN "Has Malema started talking did Jimmy explain the sms yet anyway?? @Thato M Does malema ever stop talking Manyi can only fool himself not the public NO HE DID NOT @Walter Spatula do you ever stop typing?

How I wished! They dealt with the financials manyi a gupta employee period remember he's angry TNA INNOVATIVE? THIS GUYS CAN JUSTIFY CRAP!! Maleka is trying to show that for Manyi to buy a loss-making entity from the Guptas was solely for money-laundaring and was not just an innocent business decision as it seemed! 
2:53:24,2:54:12, "Maleka got this "i like this Manyi guy Judge Zondo stop interrupting the Counsel As I have said...inquiry pospone ...kwaaaaaaaaa @Thando Nkutha.

Save us the lousy so called workshop Manyi But why does the chairperson allow abrupt interjections? why did tna start broadcasting on SABC immediately after the public broadcaster received a bailout? Go workshop Atul and Dudu in Dubai Zondo is lost and he needs to wake up cz Manyi is running away with his mind

"​Here is Manyi guilty #1 he appoint two head of GC "this commission is not as we perceived "When u get caught stealing jus say ""Sorry"" deal with the consequences n move on empty vessels usually makes the loudest noise "Ms. Williams evidence isn't tested or cross examined I think Manyi will come out victorious over Maleka. Zondo is co presenting with Manyi 
2:57:59,2:59:13, @Yose Human what you?so we can tell you what your people do Telma Manyi shows uncomforbility. "@yose because you let colonizers in public school raise and educate your kid and you only finally ""discover"" them as teenagers.. don't be a useless racist" Maleka has by his own admission approved williams inputs as true and correct. Tells you the line of reasoning commissions legal team is already leaning towards. That is aleady clear. 39 HIS RECORDS @Dumisani Nxumalo 😂😂😂😂 Me too i used to do so.... open your ears O 
2:59:16,3:00:43, SABC who has captured you now??? not again mara Hallo Counsel 😍 yose you sound like one of the indian cabals @Nkosikhona Ginya both are witnesses. Both could be guilty. On what basis would you be relying on one evidence over another? 2018 COPS ARE HERE FOR ARRESTING MANYI 15min break. i will cal in a😂😂fter ... Manyi will let the commission kno when to break 👮👮👮 
3:00:48,3:01:17, Ow Manyi has the legal team in shambles "Shart up GAGAGA shut up manyi "Williams even got the dates wrong HESTOLD THEM but why Zondo J is explaining so much 😀😀😀😀 Ehe uyaphapha Malek 
3:01:24,3:02:22, im glad its not straightforward 😃 @Dumisani Nxumalo. Yes i thought it was only me who was doing like this. But now i''m glad even Gupta puppet had done the same and they still doing it now. TELMA cause him to tremble @Thato M i think ms williams is still going to be questioned continue exposing them how disorganized they are Manyi. What a school by error for learned counsels "Nelson Mr Zondo can u keep quiet an let th game begin He needs a hot soup to catch a wakeup...otherwise...this s one of his bad day in history of aw Zondo interrupts himself also 
3:02:33,3:03:15, "In this country when you make observations which counter the dominant narrative peoplelike manyi must ot in jail Jimmy he think he smart "yall cant expect paper to precises all the time Let him breathe for 30 min PLEASE I want to go to bathroom but i dont want to miss any part of this. "@Nkosikhona Ginya the question was the basis for comparison. Not procedural process you are now pointig to Maleka thinks he's smart not Manyi "So far it's clear Manyi is economical with the truth 
3:03:21,3:04:34, Yah It's not STRAIGHTFORWARD 😂😃😄😄😄 Jimmy thiiinks he is smart Take 5 min break 😂😂😂😂 mr maleka now I officially DISLIKE Zondo Manyi uyiskhokho "Mzwanele isn't smart Maleka thinks English is the value yard stock to measure intelligence. All those who came with preconceived ideas will turn against Zondo 
3:04:37,3:05:13, but the witness is already confused he does not remember anything Skhumbuzo indeed Maleka is loosing it. This is not on. A break will give him time to recollect with his colleagues and get some pointers bathong Maleka lol At first i thought Zondo was transparent now I see his not. gotta respect those intelligent captures eh?! at the detriment of your own National treasury on Telma Okay Zondo is coming to the rescue again @SIBUSISO MABUZA he does not even remember the page numbers 
3:05:19,3:06:15, Manyi isilima "He is a lubricious sociopath Zoned is making it boring now This happens when you think you Master of it all Maleka Williams evidence has not been tested though What's Maleka on now? Is Manyi still there? Give him a 30 min break "@Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi  
3:06:18,3:07:08, i think Zondo is spoiling the game "manyi is a hostile witness "Manyi is boring now move Is it impossible for Zondo to keep quite just for 20 min... Give Maleka a break.. he a clearly working alone today against 2 witnesses at the moment "hahaha Maleka is just under attack Maleka is avoiding a break. Manyi is on SNOOZING MOOD thato I finally agree. he is smart 
3:07:08,3:07:42, @Bronx Wavy. 😂😂 who is the other witness? hahah hahaha Maleka is trying shem yaz. Manyi Telma manyi always clarifying please J Zondo let the Q and A flow please please Maleka has been damaged LOL...Will we get answers from Manyi? Ye/No! @Desmond hear him now? the 2nd witness

3:08:30,3:09:06, maleka is making him contradict himself over and over again "i dont understand what is wrong with what maleka is doing Please folks do not name your children TELMA @Desmond Masilela But what was the problem to avoid or evade? LOL Zondo is even giving answers on behalf of manyi now His now confused again. He is confused Dumisani Nxumalo so Manyi is on cross examination kahle kahle Now I will not drink Thelma Wine no more coz it sounds like Telma 
3:09:08,3:10:17, Yes/No.... and then qualify Ai 🙆 confused again and again the guy was just on a mission to give the guptas a share of Gov spending on advts "Open test book for Manyi but you follow rules manyi simple yes or no @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU. This man got his tactics from his Father JZ to avoid questions. His father used to do so in parliament. Give him a 30 min break HE IS ON THE SNOOZING MOOD There are many departments who contracted without the use of the Telmar system. lol 
3:10:22,3:11:22, @Keith...spot on instead of saying yes or no he says he is confused When is Min Mantashe scheduled to give his testimony this man is a real dodger his evidence is recorded and his inconsistency will be proven later Schooled by Zuptas... You will have to keep shouting a word 'rephrase' if you have to respond to Mr Maleka #English on deck. Manyi is misleading commission. dont know why an inquiry if you will answer on their behalf 
3:11:36,3:12:38, manyi if there no process ther is no country.this manyi is very useless.anc members they must stand up chase useless people. whatever whatever whatever HE THOUGHT WE WERE PLAYING HERE "Again lol its an exemption if there are no systems to guide buying in the gov. then that is why we have this corruption in this country he is a professor in misleading what ever what ever lol 
3:12:39,3:14:13, This is a problem Chair Cn we just pull out the regulations of Tema bulk buying has a rule to follow No this is a problem cheer pls call Telma on the stand to answer fr herself The only thing that will let this guy answer question is to apear in court and be put behind bars. Finish and Klaar. Maleka issue was comparison. He should argue based on law not on what Williams said. He could've achieved a lot by that. I hope they realise Geees...a real spin doctor this fella TNA DID NOT USE.... YEH
