DA won Western Cape! the commission of zondo all this educated chaps allowed to be bullied to become puppets of a foreign family brothers. what's a shame Almost everyone knew about the corruption and misconduct led by the Guptas. we are only been told now when they've gone already. @Jean Hou You must be ANC "I thought educated folks are not easy to be bought 
46:42,52:19, @Marvel Ramatshela Yes - everybody knew except the ANC - or so they say. "the prosses for state capture is going to leave zuma and his cabined in jail now. remember ramaphosa is not acting now "No one blew the whistles "@Papi Jan When that happens Our money have been blown up just to carer the just to cater for 1 family and Zuma "@Papi Jan Greed knows no colour As I wait to see them go to jail. The only ANC chaps who went to prison for corruption is Convict Tony Yengeni and late Mr J Selebi out of 1000s we know We need to start building more prisons for all the ANC criminals. 
53:10,58:32, Netherlands is closing prisons because the they are no more criminals to incarcerate Netherlands don't have the ANC to deal with. Maybe let's borrow their prisons end send the corrupt morons there I'd be happy with that but I doubt whether they would. inequality is what breeds criminality "They messed up our country they chowed a lot of money @Felix Muyoba I disagree - I know many poor people who are fine upstanding citizens. That's a lame excuse for the ANC. 
58:59,1:32:37, i apologise..i am wrong on this one.. No problem - I do agree that inequality is something that has to be dealt with. The wage gap is obscene. i agree with you @Derek Main..some people still commit criminality though they have plenty..it is just greed.. Yes - it seems the wealthy are the worst criminals @Felix Muyoba . Their greed makes them become sociopaths. true 'So is the Justice institutions going to do its job like quickly responding to domestic disputes.
