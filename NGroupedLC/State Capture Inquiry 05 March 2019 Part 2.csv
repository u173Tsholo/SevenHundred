24:09,26:39, "make no mistake we are now only looking at the ears of the hippo 783 Zuma charges is like murder Please vote on the 8th May 2019 the problem is for who Susan i feel like not voting at all 😎 @Bridgette Kekana .yet he sitting comfortably in Nkandla If we don't vote nothing is going change Can we just agree that CORRUPTION is a STATE OWN ENTITY on its own 
26:45,28:54, not to destroy but to force CR to charge them one is Nomvula these people talk millions like it is bread money and sweetys for the kids @welton paulse 🤞 we need to rid ourselves from ANC Adv Madonsela naned the document State of Capture:Secure in Comfort..it is exactly what Zuma is enjoying now @Magda Seguin True CR said he will only take action against Cabinet (NEC) members once he received Zondo's report. we need to get rid of greedy politicians and busness looks like a neverending story @ Ben 
28:59,32:05, Thuli Madonsela for president I voted for Zuma once and I regret that "Easy ANC ANC must get oppisition Zuma is parading on Twitter and Zuma wife no 5 is uploading pics of their glamourous life on Instagram...nauseating Lucky Lucky to the person about land restatution the corruption bug is already there cr will do it in part on goverment and unused land but will not compramize food security "@John James. unfortunately "Oh the confidence and the Articulation. This is another Shaun Abrahams with no credibility ""blah blah blah"" Hey John dis you watch Utube today 
32:10,37:11, to wich i agree to if anyone wants to farm help him to produce just remember all are not suited for that ocupation\ white ppl are suited for that occupation the ANC is their own opposition and enemy for the next election i have some black and indian farmer friend who are susessful in what they doand are just as frustration about land grabs as the rest of us "we all belong to the land  Anc is the enemy of progress n development bcos of corruption "@Bridgette Kekana agreed this bustered. "NO ruling party anywhere in the world 
37:45,40:34, Is he still lying this comrade?? He has been talking so which party must we vote @Sthakathi Khumalo lies have no end .... they only chase their own tail ! share the power give the DA then EFF next "I would want the government to be criminally charged as well "this is what they call fix the fukup and lie lie and lie never admit to anything unless the ""price is right""" "The ANC will win the next election whether we like it or not He will talk till his nonsense with his bald head and his pixie ears @Sthakathi Khumalo with the right approach EFF could topple ANC 
41:35,46:34, Apartheid existed because there was no democracy. That is all different now @ngomane l dont agree with u they hv realise their mistakes "we must change to a goverment away from the colonial style Maimane and his DA have nothing to offer the majority of South Africans. EFF will overtake them. ANC has been messing up for 25 years. "@Bridgette Kekana i agree with you the eff have no aproach what so ever self enrichment aka shivambo an co so let us leave them in political dessert Joel since when is it that a party must offer anything. its peoples tax money that pays for things. people need to learn that. you get what you put in. EFF can't offer what they don't have. ANC will win based on inertia. The ignorant masses are still in the dark so they'll vote for what they've always voted for. Enlightened ones will take their votes elsewhere @Darryl Lavis. Are we a democracy or socialist state? The power in the latter is centralised and benefits an elitist group at the expense of the majority. 
46:47,48:50, The only reason that makes white hate Eff is because they are not scared to speak their minds and they speak for black people and they preach EQULITY in all spheres an that is a threat to wmc time will be the healing aspect when us old timers and the jail (robben island ocupants) are gone and capasitated politicians are in gov it will happen Lets us give CR a chance n l think the wrong doers hate CR jobs need to be created. exports improved. unions rights reduced or removed. Government sets the rules and should apply them. and people need to know the truth. @ Bridgette we will give him a chance and he will be president Someone explain to me in law when person reach 55 to 60 years it's going to pension when all this toppies at AFRICAN NATIONAL CORRUPTION go there "@Bridgette Kekana people will b voting for a party carnoth you like to Kill boer kill the farmer aka eff EFF is populist....they condone the disasters like Venezuela and Zimbabwe...they Will make SA a total failed state.The promises in their manifesto are fairy tales 
50:13,51:52, "@Magda Seguin the chairman of the ANC some more bread and sweetys money do they blush when they talk this amounts YUP to make sure we dont go that way "@ Ben Cole Which way? GC? Someone has got the money. it was not miscalculated. "And who is ""we""?" How on earth can they miscalculate!!!! it cant be. 
52:07,55:55, "@ Danie i dont condone killing anyone irrespective of his or her race "Who watched this Vid ""UFS student cleaning up after EFF protesters has social media users divided""" I think humans are a disgrace ! Yes chair Making calculations to sounds and look smart on TV. Mantashe is wasting money...on this very YT you can explore the truth from the Venezuela people themselves @Magda Seguin. Venezuela is a failed socialist state. The governing party is sending a fact finding mission to Venezuela under leadership of its Secretary General. To find out what? When did Venezuela became a failed state? Media has made people very stupid #SMH 
56:57,1:00:26, "@Ben Cole I agree...Chavez nationalised everything hoping oil money will make a difference He's trying to send a certain perspective without having facts at hand. People who believe the EFF nationalisation plans should take heed Mantashe himself is caught up in state capture...it's a joke that he wants to take a 'fact finding' trip when the world knows the situation in Venezuela Mantashe s construction compaa can some one get this talking atm some strepsils for his throet penalities were raised to strong arm the company to sell knowing they can reduce the penalities chair there is no piont "@ Indoda

We also know your white tribal challenges i.e. British vs Jews vs Afrikaners vs Portuguese🤭 
1:18:07,1:21:05, "Frik Do you agree that Verwoerd was the only Afrikaner leader who was no a puppet to the Zionists and Freemasons? "Amazed to see how the chat group quickly changes course. Ossilates between race I don't understand share the wealth of the country. I know that rather as work hard and honest that will benefit all. no free handouts. Multitasking 😄 "the chair does soud a bit ill Do you agree that Zuma actually did try to do the same for black people what Verwoerd was trying to do for Afrikaners? in Zuma stole from all for his and his familys gains. No free handouts because you're already flourishing in white privilege😁🤭 
1:21:46,1:24:50, ha ha you dreaming. he stole mostly from the poor his own people and stil does The entire Eskom hearings here at the Commission is interconnected.Listening everyday is a spider web of I interconnection..it's only the characters that change daily Zuma from president to prisoner n Mandela from prisoner to president A white man is arrogant until he's poor and his skin go dark and dry like that of a dog. That's only when he realizes what life is worth. do you have a family "#Indoda Yamaqiniso  "Yes the anc locks up white woman who use the filthy K word but not a president who stole billions and sold the country for 3 silver pieces 
1:24:50,1:28:09, "#Indoda Yamaqiniso  I must go ......
