1:55:22,1:56:12, @Maryann Diamond GM "@Maryann Diamond GM How is a prepayment also a payment over time on delivery Dr Ngubane? ...Pure looting and deceptions with taxpayers'money. he looks like he deserves a donkey to ride on not a toyota All the Crooks got their payment Just in Time - JIT no K he must walk @Heather Durr Totally agree 👍 Yeah Ben.

Roza this Dr is on another level he's in the class of fake dumb Dr's lol rampol just listen @Roza E I hope it all goes well at the Dr Shifting the blame 
2:00:28,2:01:20, now im going to look at the doctor nd think wether hes fake or not @Alta 😅😅😅 Surely call records can show if he contacted Daniels to ask her to draft the resolution for Koko and DMR? "They employed so many mech engineers with b-tech diplomas & no practical experience @Louis C exactly I hope he's a white Dr roza The arrogance is slowly fading Pastor pray hard for me its the eye institute "@Siyabonga

You said you didn't know about the issue of the prepayment until Daniels came to you so how come your own evidence states it was part of the acquisition discussion prior to that! @Roza 🙏🏾🙏🏾🌹 fools like this put OCM in business rescue Ben is a qualified physician 
2:05:15,2:06:29, ms K thank u dr ben ... you know i know we know @Teunis van Ree HI Dr Ben Ngubane sounds truthful .... he knows what he is talking about Everybody knows 🎶🎶🎶🎶 Leonard Cohen He should join the delinquent director whatsapp group. There’s a difference between a pre-purchase and a pre-payment There are too many people like this ‘Dr’ in high positions - if only they appointed competent people (black or white or whatever) - but guys like this are the reason the guptas raided our country @Person of interest brilliant 
2:06:33,2:08:08, Hi there @ALTA 🌷 @Kwanele to me it looks like he was used and wasn’t aware "One thing this commission has laid bare. Our government and all SOE's are run by incompetent Person of interest🙏 "...Imperialist should have to prove their worthiness in Society Either he was complicit or alternatively a stupid fool. so true pieter then they blame the people who they sold everything to lol that's how these dumb fools roll whats happening in 20 words or less? just joined @Dominic Przybylski ..or both 
2:08:22,2:10:11, Dr’s should limit their practice to the field they studied! I wouldn’t go to a Dr of Philosophy for Brain Surgery or ride a rocket designed by a Medical Doctor @Dominic I think it’s the latter on your statement Ngubane has dribbled himself. Clearly they had already agreed on Tegeta as the purchaser of OCM and pretended to be running a wider process. @Mr K - exactly - they should be jailed for life for treason Dr was certainly used and comfortable with the team he was working with "so they wanted ""prepaid data ie coal"" and GUPTAS said no...." from a Dr to a coal distributor thief lol FORT HARE DOCTORS.....LUCKY PACKETS HOw about this being extremely stupid t0 pay someone who does not own the mine. They could just as easily reneged on the deal. What assets could you claim?
