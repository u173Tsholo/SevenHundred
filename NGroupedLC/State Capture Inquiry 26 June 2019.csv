Ms September must go back to modelling. She is too beautiful to be smart. No !!! Zuma needs Adv Mabena or Hoofmeyer Maleka I mean Who would you have to interrogate Zuma Pretorius or Hofmeyr? cool here Who is gong to cross examine ZUMA 
38:14,39:16, "If it's Pretorious "@Rox Moleme I wish SC Maleka I really like SA politic the way they handled to view the State Affairs of Inquiry. @Danie Nilsen Let me guess - you frequent SAA flyer or you a DA with that 3 language greeting. anyway hi. And he will appeal the commision maleka or hofmeyer for Zuma @Cassius Mngomezulu I would prefer Adv Maleka maleka for zuma 
39:40,40:10, 100% behind Maleka or Zondo himself must deal with his cousin Zuma "SOMETHING.... will be Blamed on Race anyway This commision needs Gerie nel...👿👿👿👿👿👿👿 Hofmeyer c vf Zuma is coming with the interpreter Poor advocate looks stressed already b4 she even gets to the core The devil is a liar

They frustrate the Chair with this advocate. does the DCJ have a say in choosing the evidence leader of the day? Cannot see this evidence leader tackling ubaba Zuma "@sanele songelwa  🤔 Adv Maleka plse Mr Docuuuuuument 
46:37,48:03, We want Dudu here as well The witness is more relaxed compare to Miss SEPT @Toibo wa Toibo Antimba lol that's our bae Zuma will head but Ms September she will need a helmet if she will be the advo on that dae "@Joburg this is not a learning platform  "Tich Ziny "if this was football "9 Million people are unemployed "Miss September must now ask ""Who appoints the president?"" now that she knows who appoints the minister. Just go the whole hog 
48:04,50:15, she feels intimidated @Norman Zwane 😁😁😁😁 bathong "thando nothing wrong with advovate September it is her way of making her victems that she is incompetant so she works on that strategy like luring a prey into her spiders web "4 Muniscipalities won't be paying their employees and Banks don't care looks like she is the one being lured @Daniel.. 😀😁😁@Norman Zwane "Daniel I don't have a problem with Miss S! However I feel witnesses will be wasted because of her method of questioning .

It won't end Its long boring and there is no UMPF! @Norman Zwane lol its Trumps fought..... @Rox Moleme its starting to bore now ai yes that is how many are involved here it is a whole dloody lot and uses taxpayers money but no worry about it at least some of them will go to jail also eating tax payers money we canot win @Rox they could even over fill the Dome.. Maybe her team can assist her and ask more serious questions "@Zama Kubheka People will just start walking away and only me who has his eye on Ms September will remain 
52:14,54:02, @Norman Zwane gudluck The USA president has assigned to that country's ambassador to keep an eye on SA as a potential investment destination that is why they are hovering over Ramaphosa actions like a hawk @Norman Zwane Smart moove is it wrong to say luring? @Zama Kubheka I might not be corrupt but I'm sneaky. "Hahahah @Mashau that's deep politics no Daaanni @Norman Zwane we can all c u If Ms September fumbles again I will adjourn

55:08,55:58, Danie what is % Rox must adjourn Zondo is as sharp as a Minora blade. September Mabena is embarrassing the chair with stupid repetitive questions "there are using a lot of monies by this inquiries and at the end of the day "@Danie Nilsen When you mean what Daniel? If you were ?Ms Septem""luring"" asking a silly question through a loudhailer" She asks questions but does not hear the responses I wonder if they will be forced to pay back seeing that no body´s visas and bank accounts were blocked until the final outcome. Probably they trying to find loop holes to set them all free. DCJ does not even need a shaving gel.. 
56:16,58:20, Rox please leave I hear you Sbonelo we shall take 15 min in the next 2min...this hearing will be adjourned will the chair allow Zuma`s lawyers to answer on his behalf please balance me @Yolo More I dont think she expects an answer.
