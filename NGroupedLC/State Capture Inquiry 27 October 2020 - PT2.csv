She is a woman. I don't know @Anne M. but this does not end the instability. Tshwane does not have a mayor the 3 biggest parties are all fielding a candidate so no one will get a 50% plus one support. "How long shall dey break our profit then we stand aside and look. Enough 
16:10,19:44, 👍 @FieliesSA Don't call human beings things. That is derogatory. I hate that these old people get to be in positions of power everywhere while they are old n easily confused if you steal you arnt a women . I told you that @Mzalwane Mzala So the municipal elections will have to be held for a possible solution? The Nelson Mandela Metro (PE) have lost a lot of money as Treasury withdrew grants because there is no mayor. She is a woman. We cannot go around denying peoplel their humanity regardless of their crimes. michael ... i rest my case @Lesige Lesige you will be surprised how(relatively) young some of these are. Ex the special advisory guy last week(Gama reinstatement) is way too young i.m.o. 
19:58,22:25, hey guys! is she a hero or villain? The DA's case was against the city being run by an administrator and the court agreed with them. Every operative in the state organs has gone through a rigorous process to ensure they are sufficiently parasitic and without any signs of integrity. If they blow a whistle ask only one thing:.. @LionView Correct plus she has not been found guilty in a court. Only the boy who thinks he's the prosecutor and judge. "@Mzalwane Mzala how and why did you find yourself in a position to observe the theft and how long did you wait to bloow the whistle @Anne M. If there is no compromise elections will be the only option. "@Thando Cezula :videocall:
