6:05,9:38, @Thapelo Motabogi I have also noticed that the volume is lower after lunch. Maybe it's a different sound guy after lunch? always "i don't think so @SABC Digital News Please increase the volume why do we just listen and take note what is happening to our country due to absolute greed from all stake holders maybe we can bilateraly get a salution to this puke that is ocuring plz @Thapelo Motabogi üòÇ "you know nice free food makes you lazy @Danie Nilsen It would have been nice if this was broadcast live on one of the national radio stations so that more people could hear what happened. 
10:31,21:25, @Anne M. - I also agree. Then you can go out and listen yes i agree with you Anne but at least some of us are getting it it 770 watching now it is ridiculas LIAR Sound is very poor guys and is boring then flip the remote and watch muvango stop moaning pleaze @John Fagan how is he a liar? I just feel ...When you do a Raid...You do .i...I Think he is protecting some one I think I am Just irritated higher up the chain stopped them to do it at X time. 
22:10,29:34, @Felix Muyoba. Eyi I dont know this kant this is not the truth who told him not to go on that day "the witness are just stating facts as much as he want to he can not speculate WHAT Happened to the element of surprise? this is strange probably already compromised. that is just what the chair is sayinf now "for example So who died Eish my ears bra 
29:38,30:54, as a expert the software and tools is available to anneliese the systems emedif This guy and the SIU was led by the nose all the way SABC is sabotaging us now. wat now sabc "now is the video guy Video shedding !! @SABC Digital News come in sabc is captured its clear that SIU had mpimpi in their mist cdes. 
31:13,32:34, Ground control to Major Tom !!! what is going on now SABC/ Should we not hear what is being said now or what ?? Houston we have a problem Airing on the same channel as Sponge Bob Square Pants April 1st Bring in the SIU experts At a crucial moment as one would like to know how on earth someone tells the SIU of their pending search on them; state capture makoya here as dull as it is what's been proven here for the judge to take away was that Boasasa had connections all over and it what all the way to the top. 
33:08,34:52, SIU is already compromised SABC please read our comments The leak of info about the planned search and seizure makes them Special Information Unit. "@SABC Digital News  Is this april fool? SABC captured now!! Where is the stream live gone to now PumlileüòÄüòÄüòÅüòÅ Gavin Watson and Aggrizi to clever for them. But they had inside government assistance all the time. @Poland Man. I guess is april fool 
35:58,38:16, I have a feeling some people with power are cutting this stream. The ANC does not want us to know. We could see it over the weekend as well. They will fabricate open lies to protect themselves. @Pieter Torlage seems like it just ended. As tax payers we are the sponsors of this commission and u are depriving us to witness this process now it is unfair prematurely ended Proceedings should be paused when streaming fails "These guys are all so afraid to do the jobs that they get paid for SABC has been scammed no picture no sound... @Pieter Torlage The first step would be to get rid of the ANC. It will never end while they are in power. Last week the sounds were as if a short circuit is being attempted...I may be wrong but it is suspucious 
38:47,40:32, @derek main absolutely SIU bosses and Mr Watson have cut the feed. State Capture is supposed to be finalised by May? It is more likely to be an ANC ploy to win the election and then the State will be captured once again by more corruption. Are the same captured state security officials still in employ? Is this sabotage? ooooh Its working "@Derek Main Get rid of ANC and replace it with who? DA (A.K.A NP)? EFF (ex ANC)? COPE (ex ANC)? UDM (ex ANC) @Pieter I guess the state capture will only end of all this political parties uses the money from their own pockets for campaigns n not take money from business people 
40:38,41:51, for sure sabotage of stream @Magda Seguin ....maybe not... but the captured politicians are still in power.... enca stream is working perhaps is raining in Jozi am here at the Capital of SA Pretoria @The Truth Any party but the ANC. There is no other party as corrupt as them. It could be that some big shot got scared names were to be mentioned "Corruption is a global phenom. I‚Äôm just proud that SA is dealing with it "but enca stream is unlisted @The Truth Look at the ANC election lists - they are not dealing with corruption. 
42:10,47:13, Looks like SSA Bosasa is on this line. @The Truth As I've said numerous times - voting for the ANC to get rid of corruption is like americans voting for the Ku Klux Klan to get rid of racial prejudice. "banking details for who now  Haven't they heard of fibre yet? STRATCOM is on strike..... "@Derek Main Then you are delusional and subtly racist to think corruption is synonymous to SA. Corruption is far worse in other countries such as US. It is well hidden Bosasa paid cash bribes Was Oellerman paid a cash bribe.. possibly The ANC NEC are meeting today after the news of the book on Ace was published.I am looking forward to read their statement. 
48:23,57:53, STRATCOM.....said...... LOL!!!!! WTFH when the truth gets to hot to handle it may not be wanting to be broadcast to the nation... Wow and yet these Investigators did nothing more afterall this corruption effected the entire country for a either 19 years!? another 10 yrs for another 10 years these blatant criminal activities Carried on regardless of this Investigation.. very odd! Agrizzi said the exact same thing @The Truth Show me how I'm racist. I put it to you that you pulling the race card makes YOU the racist. "@Val Speirs

What is so sad is that so many people did their work diligently and honestly and was victimised until they resigned or they were suspended for having done nothing wrong ruining their lives @The Truth I'm waiting... After all this I think those affected must sue the state in a class action 
1:05:24,1:08:46, @Magda Seguin .... that's the ANC for you.... "The honourable thing would be for the ANC to resign from government "Betrayal "@ Ewald kruger they thought they would be protected forever Bosasa. .Eskom.VBS..Municipalities. .ANC ...Corruption. Corruption. . .Now PETROL increased Electricity ...what's going on.WAKE UP SOUTH AFRICANS. .. Staying on the subject.... all the companies that lost out on tenders to BOSASA should do a class action against the ANC.... not the government... to claim back lost profits and costs... ANC makes promises before the elections but never keeps the promises AFTER the elections. Only fools believe them @Robert Russell that will be the first and best to do "With all these commissions 
1:08:47,1:11:23, "@Marietjie Larney Yeah - like the ""New Dawn"" joke." "Robert Russell So you know he is a racist? You are being like all the EFF and BLF sheep.STOP IT!! eish....i think some people are seriously dof! greetings @maarman Maarman...go play elsewhere asseblief @R hunter They must be ANC supporters. remember that it takes 2 to tango on one side goverment or indaviduals there of and on the other side public entreprizes ie bossasa and the rest of them "i wonder if some of them will be coming to blow the bugle or trompet or trombone but a whisle no no way to small i want to hear it fkn loud and clearand do not forget ""TUMA MINA"" what a jole" 
1:11:43,1:13:38, The ANC should be sued for keeping corrupt ministers in positions when they (the ANC) knew they were corrupt but yet let the stealing as a collective continue to be thieves... ü§ëü§• @Daniel Nilsen...Batho Pele is also a hoke *joke @Robert Russell The only reason the ANC did that is because they are all corrupt. agreed "Yup The ANC 's slogan is 'People First...they are mocking the nation the buffalo man must take his little buffalo to the police station after this show

Never trust what comes out of an ANC politician's mouth. "u know till this racist testimony is not tested Zuma must the first to go to prison "Are you joking? Danie Nisen "@Robert Russell But how? Take the m down @maarman Maarman So you think the DA is controlling the state capture commission? You must be an ANC supporter. 
1:16:35,1:18:28, In the Free State they used the health budget for other things...The healthcare and hospitals in the FS is a disgrace "@maarman Maarman Test it to your heart;s content Section 27 and TAC had many meetings in the communities and appealed to Ace to get his act together but he was busy with the Guptas instead ‚úäüèøeff this is a thought that enters my mind why now close to elections this corruppt pie is on the table and at the Sue them as a party who nominated minsters who were proven to have stolen from the country in positions to allow them to have been able to keep stealing... @Norman Zwane same time in the media the use of the eff and blf radical threats against a certian race group is it an tactic to divert ettenion away from the corrupt officials I agree "hi guys i just got an SMS saying i have 100MB left

1:20:07,1:22:32, Done for today? those people are the majority thus we are doomed regardless Civil Society will have to do it.... but I firmly believe that there are grounds for a class action against the ANC @Norman Zwane for "...IN THIS SCENARIO OF TESTIMONY EFF and BLF are both fronts for the ANC. There job is to see to what extent they can stir and then the ANC comes afterwards and either support or reject. @Lee Hendrix I have been saying it repeatedly I don‚Äôt have problems to Ramaphosa son he was honestly show contract and the money he got was through sweats I wish it was doable like yesterday @Robert Russell @Planeless Pilot apparently it is true..yesterday BLF met and had dinner with Zuma

"@Derek Main Where I grew up This investigator has been bought off. @Derek Main how can we express ourselves very deeply to the point the can see all south african are tired of peoples who get paid for nothing verwoerds policy failed what he left behind for the country to be useds was wasted in 24 years sis man it took the calonials hundred years to build yhe best country in africa and the anc came and fkd @The Truth You're probably talking of the OLD ANC. When they still had principles. What we are dealing with now is an entirely different animal. Corrupt to the core. "@Danie Nilsen The Black still have VOLKSTATE and kings  Danie that's not correct. Danie Nilson I AGREE

They are fighting dirty. it is this kind of investigation that will make the ""criminals"" walk free. you can't present a search warrant via telephone conversation." @The Truth .....not true........you have been brainwashed........Just think if the DA could have done.........this would be Paradise....

They moan too much. @Derek Main which system in practicality are we to apply like which country can we copy the system from and if it worked before as having politicians in south africa means stealing and feeding too muc Anything is better than Commies/Socialists....fact @jeevan singh - we China are pulling all the strings- soon SA will own China more than you can pay - then the next days our ships will be in Cape Town "@Derek Main I‚Äôm glad u recognize that the problem isn‚Äôt ANC the org @Sinawo Qhaji .....they are the lessor of ALL the Evils.....fact @Andrew Mboweni - no system can save SA now - wait we are already here (China) @The Truth No - you misunderstand me.

A LED light cost between R200 and R900 - Why are we hearing about lights "[s the chinese a funny type of pink looking mlungu and the rulers are afraid of them because of all the money they ""owe"" the funny looking mlungus" "@Matthew Adams The ANC of today is a far cry from the once principled movement. They might as well be different parties. In fact "@Derek Main  "@The Truth I say we hit them from all sides and in any way possible "Tata the government of the national party stole in the name of apartheid the government of anc through state capture BEEand tenders 
2:46:03,2:47:38, FACT - ANC will win with more than 60% after May. It hurts nne? Aw shame... you‚Äôll be ok. #MajorityRules @Andrew Mboweni - I believe the Apartheid Government also stole money. They were never found out whos is the lady lawyer shes beautiful man @The Truth So you're one of the idiots? "@Derek Main I agree. I‚Äôm just not confident that there is anyone politically strong enough to deal with them. 1 thing for sure because the apartheid government was one group of peoples mainly white government only @Sipho I don‚Äôt know I want to know as well @Madelein Huxtable @The Truth ....cause their is so many Brainwashed Bra's ...ne.......can't think clearly.......too much fog in da brains.....ne

I'm waiting. "This lady 
2:50:38,2:53:18, """Did you drive in or walk?""" I hate apartheid but there was a lot of work and hospital equipments were working and petrol was cheap "@Mike Lock No Who can trust him @Sipho Sepale on Twitter she is Advo Refilwe M jeff radebe since 1994 to 2019 he is still a minister this is scary about cyril ramaphosa we cant keep the same faces for so long jeff radebe must retire from keeping the blue lights otherwise anc wil "@Sipho Sepale No longer beautiful to me "@Cedrick Mabogo Ndi ngauri population was less @The Truth .......that is true......the ANC will still be in majority.......cause there are too many who will still vote for them no matter what....true 
2:53:30,2:55:14, Cedric. Everything in apartheid time was built on the backs of the black people. You must not forget that Apartheid benefited the whites not the Blacks. @Mike Lock Yup his people are hungry he buy.s a buffalo his people are asking an increase in pay quite high but high enough to die ? his peop[le are mentilly ill and cost to much for ezidemeni so they are to die this mess of south sudan benefits of oils and new contracts and anc helping south sudan to independence it is not right this guys like jeff radebe are lingering to business deal KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU you must be missing your ex when you start seeing her as a look alike to this beautiful soul Very ..very unfortunate........cause we sure NEED the DA.... Exactly... What has our government archived post 94 everything has collapsed nothing is working no service. Skelms will get away here 
2:55:41,2:58:42, if the anc loooses they must blame this cosy ministers just like jeff radebe exactly DCJ. criminals will walk free. They are playing dirty now. and they are going to loose this cases Gwede Mantashe set this investigator up. The ANC will do ANYTHING to get out of all this......mark my words......ANYTHING Mantashe... has mantashed us already!! Now this fence he recieved will just be a tune haaah "@Mike Lock DA? AKA NP? Not sure they can win the majority‚Äôs trust. Maybe if they get rid of Maimane and allow the real leader of DA to run it "@Sipho Sepale My ex was way too beautiful Peter. Correct. This was done intentionally. no chance the investigator did not know the right procedure. Well I reckon the DA is the Lessor of ALL THE EVILS....facts 
2:58:42,3:01:54, Hey Zondo.... so now AGAIN the thieves and crooks are protected AGAIN.... "ladies and gentlemen lool goodbye Sindile F this. now we're are done. Nobody goes to jail. incompetence! @Thando which is sad when it is blatantly clear they are crooks... But the ANC doesn't..... Zondo is right about privacy but are investigators not equipped with the legal authority to do as the guy did Now we are in a mess. lock the investigator. useless idiot.
