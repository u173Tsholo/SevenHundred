The damage he caused the country is massive 
34:42,35:38, "@Yose Human HYou getting your nickers in a twist @Michael Wild Standard Chartered has admitted guilt to currency manipulation Economics are clearly not the judge's strong point ABSA made a statement that they collaborated with others to manipulate the rand exchange value... now why are we at this again?💁💁💁 Anne and working with Guptas "make your lives easier for yourselves @Michael Wild Although the dismissal of Mr Nene was an impact on its own "Michael Zulu's are pretty useless. They need a guy that dress himself in leopard skins to tell them what to do.

I don't get bugged by him anymore. @Melvict Melbourne What do you know about Zulus? welcome. 
38:08,40:26, Thank you Zondo!! Zonda is asking fare questions because it is what Zuma used it as his defences. now Zonda is getting a business answer. Blocking here is a life saver! I have quite a few idiots blocked. Best decision ever! Investors also capture the system @Yose Human history is still relevant King Solomon told the AmZulu to stop fighting long ago Who is this adv? I like him. Unlike some of the others we had @Yose Human are you a shareholder in motsepe foundation? Yose is simply a persistent & irritating Troll! 
40:27,42:37, "@Thando Nkutha true words bro! People should stop entertaining these trolls. If they do @Felix Muyoba You can block a troll by clicking on the name and click on the 3 dots on the right. "We need more Motsepes @goolamv I doubt if Ramos is not replaceable? When do the young ones get a chance if we keep redeploying the elderly? @Lebo Motsetse true..may and not one.. @goolamv Me too. Did you see the reception he got when he arrived at parliament for SONA? No one is irreplaceable. @Mzalwane Mzala VERY TRUE @Anne M. leave the hoodlum to make as much noise as he can.. 
42:53,44:13, This lady is very smart On the topic of borrowing. All countries borrows from the world bank.... Who does the world bank belog to? belong* Hi Everyone ❤ @goolamv I support you: we cannot lose that experience but can she not go on the lecture circuit and train the next generation The World Bank is controlled by the us government "Remember black professionals who remain unemployed Avuxeni @Sofia Sofia HI! I missed you! 😀 
44:17,45:18, @grant wilkinson true and the world bank as well.. @Myka'Al Daud so what is your pont? If government change is well and reasonably explained to the markets(investors) there ant be any economic mayhem as it occurred in Nenegate @grant wilkinson She also knows how to communicate her knowledge in a way that is understandable. There are smart people who fail get others to understand what is in their smart minds. @Yose Human can you please stop with this Zulu crap. Hi @rohan barnard started late today .... 😗 you don't own anything if you can fight for it Yes agree Mzalwane its on lend learn to defend your camp 
45:24,47:15, @grant wilkinson thank you. But even the US owes them a substantial amount of money.... So the US borows their own money from the world bank then? @Melvict Melbourne he likes the zulus that is why I really am trying to understand this market confidence thing. How much of the banks manipulation (which banks have admitted to doing) is factored on the value of the Rand? "Prioritize them She has such a nice voice ! @Yose Human you are like a stuck record "@Mzalwane Mzala I suspect we must replace but recycling is best. I bet we could learn more from Mbeki (both of them) "@Cebo Khumalo not long ago Cebo one question would be did that bank know what was going to happen. or did Gupta's know and inform them to trade in there favour. 
47:42,49:06, @Melvict Melbourne just block that troll. "gps kills satellites cost money @Myka'Al Daud nobody can get to 400 years in todays world. Handouts is not the way to go.

49:18,50:32, the lady is educating the commission on economics today..dcj is stunned Melvict - He s like a painful pile! @Anne M. I think such blockings last for as long as the stream is active. the ghost holding the scales? "I am simply asking "@Frik Brits next to his name is 3 dots @Ibo Thabo Bcoz common sense aint that common @Frik Brits you also have to block Yose on your side. I've blocked him a few weeks ago and he is still gone from my message line. JS Bach did the same 
50:52,52:13, But everyone else sees his messages .......... it does not help mush does it?? "@Frik Brits nope. I blocked human quite a while ago @Frik Brits Cebo they came to SA with 1 Million in 1993. And in 2016 bought a mansion in Dubai worth $46 million and can't show where all the money comes from. And bought many places in India. Unstable political situation raise uncertainty on markets drivers so they usually reduce their economic operations in such country; simply put no one will invest with unstable countries @Thando Nkutha It was wasted breath talking into the echo chamber Zuma was "@Frik Brits if I block him There are a minority who write hate messages daily. And I'm yet to see anyone win an argument with emotion and hate speech. Such slow learners. Michael so did the Oppenheimers/ your Rupert’s and many more!! 
52:14,53:06, @NormanZwane I agree with you the lady should teach and train up coming economists and accountants Zuma knowing makes no difference to him cause he can't count remember @Peter Staffen prevention of hart attack Knowing all this how come no one did anything THEN ? "Showerhead couldn't even count properly 'heart' @Sofia Sofia because the cadres were all on the take Loadshedding 
53:16,53:41, "SOUTH AFRICA STILL ON SALE CD scratches😩 "@JS Bach Neil Fraser 💯% Ouch that sound hurts ! eskom again cybersecurity breach Why do SA Gov have to live on borrowing FAKE DOLLARS (Nixon shock 1971) instead of keeping our intrinsic minerals (gold & diamonds) value them here and print the worthy as money to stimulate us? @Cebo Khumalo Anton Rupert started out as a chemistry lecturer. He didn't arrive here with millions. 
53:41,54:08, @AFRICA AZANIA you only buy things that has value en nou? Wow that hurt please mr dj @Melvict Melbourne He loved the biscuits the economists serve during the briefing however @Robert Russell hahaha Anonymous is intercepting the signal 😂😂😂😂 Europeans must go home @Ibo Thabo because grants have to be paid 
54:10,54:40, EISHKOM and now? eish.....i don;t understand a word she screeches now 😃 Listen to this lady carefully . essentially south africa is bankrupt Cebo the difference is you can go on Bloomberg and other finance sites and see what they doing and where the money is going. but I will not continue with you if you want to make it a black and white So that they'd stop worrying about South Africa Lost signel? Catherine Macleod has much to offer the country but does anyone listen to her? @Indoda Yamaqiniso Where is home for Europeans? Sangoma power vs Jesus 
54:47,55:49, the problem is our natural resources and land are owned by foreigners thing. listen to logic and an educated person explain it. black empowerment "The point isn’t that they arrived here also "Zuma sold our struggle to Guptas a sangoma exists and Jesus is a fiction @Indoda Yamaqiniso​ German especially must go home. We don't want their tourism money The Powerball is a BIG number today ! Then the same foreigners who we enrich with our resources we borrow from them again 
55:59,57:07, I am having difficulty in following today's testimony shame. what is being discussed here @Sofia Sofia what is the number? @Sofia Sofia I need to play power ball!

Norman Zwane​😂 @Norman Zwane But of course ! figures are throwing lawyers around "its not only the South african governent Take all the debt of all the state run enterprises add them up and there is enough money to have bought every family in south africa a house and taken unemployment to less than 10 oercent @Felix Muyoba I will commit myself to the poor and needy I know people always say that But cross my heart ! 
58:10,58:49, "Europe would slide back to the dark ages if we can control our resources Political instability is a cause for concern for markets role players throughout the world in this global economic jungle. anyone else's video lagging or is it Telkom now? so how money did we lose with nenegate "@Melbourne thanks Thieves are called lenders "grant wilkinson​  @Sofia Sofia be honest..you will forget about the poor i tell you.. What is being discussed is the impact of the period before and after Nene-gate on our economy.

59:32,1:00:32, 🐷🐖 I wonder if the commission has economists to help them understand numbers and figures? @rohan barnard I need to tell you something .... we have another teenage mutant ninja turtle here .. ADV ! @Cebo Khumalo SA gov can't determine the value of the rand. Free market dictate the value..what are others willing to pay "@Cassius Mngomezulu indeed! But that just disappeared @rohan barnard mine lags but i am with telkom wondering if anyone else experiencing this lag? Cebo I agree it would have an impact but the bug reason was the shuffle and uncertainty cause by Zuma Maria Ramos has admitted that they at Absa were manipulating the rand while it was all blamed on Zuma Economically intrinsic mineral mainly gold & diamonds authorise the print of money not the other way around so why we are depending the American fake dollar? 
1:00:38,1:02:36, The rand is over priced i am short the rand "@Willie Makena don't blame the leaders Regime change dirty tactics and our own clever black people alwaya fall for it.
