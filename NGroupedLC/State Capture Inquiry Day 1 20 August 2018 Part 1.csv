1:05:08,1:08:08, True.

Your vote is power I so wish for the former head of the state JG Zuma to accept the invitation and come forward to share what he knows...🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 Msholizi will never testify I admire Afro Americans for rising above slavery an working hard to turn their situation. Today they are respected in the world. I don't see this happening with some of our own black brothers in SA let's have bets... any takers? Makgowa a tena. Zondo sivukile nsizwa ungesabi @Tebogo Makoro I'm on your side.... never 
1:11:55,1:21:56, One of the Constitutional principles is to restrain state power. This is because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts completely. People seem to not understand the importance of the Constitution "@Msawenkosi - you are right This will assist in the investigation of corrupt activities of all involved in the State Capture. Whatever the witness say will not be used against them in the court of law @ Bandile truth only truth "I think they're trying to gather all facts matters to looting of state capture for future use Without the constitution we are a ship without a sail. I believe thee constitution should be mandatory focus in schools. Not to be flipped through "I am interest in what happened atSAA Will the ANC also testify ? Who is the ANC @ Justice Mamogwa? 
1:22:08,1:33:48, "It is the discretion of the Commission to recommend prosecution "@Dominic... State-guarantees perplex me. Its an idea that tax payers have willingly bailed out SOE's. I mean the recklessness of our officers will always be ""guaranteed"" by the taxpayer" This commission has made it too hot for lootfreely house.... so the ANC has now gone into the Cash in Transit Heists business as part of there fund raising efforts #likespike for @SABC Digital News the commission must watch that it doesn't turn into another news channel. I am worried so far it only names one family sometimes I forget that lawyers love tea eish Pee-time. I am disappointed the DA was denied provision to cross examine the witnesses "@Orefile...that is the unfortunate truth. The government is in shambles right now 
1:34:23,1:42:27, Wish we could have a just and fair society. Which we could hold those who continually vote the ANC accountable for all the corruption. We the people keep voting for this theft and corruption. Day 1= lawyer babble "share the wealth of the country equally Putting people behind bars should not be where this commission ends. Further policies and laws have to be changed. In my honest opinion I hope the commission recommends the re-establishment... I support that @peter pott "We will only hear how much was looted and thats it  Re-establishment of the scorpions...they had a 98% success rate in prosecutions Those accused are going to move freely out of this commissiony. Kemp and Helens SC are in the audience. blacks are the one in Government they should be the one's targeted. #BringBackScorpions 
1:43:44,1:48:02, Scorpions was independent. Thats all we need. The state tries to own every independent entity that challenges it. "Look at the people being implicated in State Capture "ladies and gentlemen Guptas must return all the money they had stolen from the poor people of South Africa "I was drunk up till 2012 The Ruperts must also return the money "I wont protect a thief who takes from the poor True "the next president will also exercise his/her power and bring Marikana commission 
1:48:17,1:49:37, It is a black and white thing. how? "There will be no prosecution White monopolu v BRICS ANC thing. Our own fault. We keep voting them into power when they have done nothing but break down what little was left of the apartheid catastrophe. ok Dishonest corrupt ministers together with all corrupt officials of the apartheid era must be named and shamed and stripped off all the corrupt gains. im not even sure i want to vote next year @Thando Nkutha its not about being racist 
1:49:43,1:51:41, Black or white. Makes no difference. We are ALL being screwed regardless. @gyburiel thanks as much as Zuma is blameworthy....much of the blame should be directed to late former president mandela who sold the country during the struggle.. they'll always be subjects Mandela never did what Zuma did very simple solution to all of this. One our people refuse to implement : Vote SOMEONE ELS Honestly what did Zuma do? This slide reflects as if the vice president post is useless .Where was he I We are all one in Christ Jesus. There's no time to play the race card. Time to build and not divide. 
1:51:50,1:53:08, The whites have stolen from us what Zuma did was to retract contracts from the white minority and because they have power they are prosecuting him otherwise state capture has been alive before 1994 Where was CR in the last 10 years And make sure he gets it himself ? @peter pott he was eating with white minority behind Zuma Peter this guy should speak in the ppls language which is Afrikaans Zuma wouldn't be so corrupt if power transition in South Africa was pure and concerned with previously underpriveledged communities... he stole why not make it right "we need to promote our beloved language 
1:53:12,1:54:34, "Field he is speaking ina European language laugh Hehehehe "waste of tax money with this Afrikaans is the best language of our country Rupperts and Oppenheimers must also be prosecuted he stole he's aware of it thought he untouchable "Zondo 
1:54:42,1:56:36, "Thando gone are those days 1994 changed our language policy but thats Zuma his ignorance speak for itself "nedzingahe White people will feel the heat hahaha "why is apartheid era capturers (openheimer the weak remain on the ground when tested but we will rise and shine after all this challenges thats who we are "thando Nkutha that consolation statement

Helens will cast doubts on this commission. by highlighting weakness @ Victor & Robbie...This is just a waste of time guys and waste of tax payers money. They should have taken the money maybe to eradicate the pit toilets ir something 
2:23:17,2:24:42, Most disgusted by the outcome of the Esidimeni hearing. Stalingrad "Thando We will look back and blame ourselves. We kept voting these incompetent thugs. Right on @Bonani Maphini "robbie He represents Atul Gupta "naicker If the State Capture Inquiry results in the Imprisonment of the GUPTAS and ZUMA Senior and JuniorJulian008 
2:24:43,2:26:17, I suspect he needs more time to prepare a defence Waste of my time too Bonani. Why I said goodbye just now. He knows cross examination is not going to be allowed. "Oh How much time do they need Twenty years 😉 Oh sorry Ajay Gupta @peter pott He just confirmed that there will be cross examination. 
2:26:38,2:28:07, He confirmed but it has not been granted "There are suspects "What is twenty years "each issue has its own lawyer mzala! who confirmed? these Gupta n Zuma hired the best minds in the country These people are pre-empting the process! Those minds are not going to do anything to derail this process! It's going to carry on!!! same whites fighting state capture are defending maybe this is another way of job creations for this whites 
2:28:08,2:30:55, I wonder because he new before that the state capture inquiry is starting today. "woooo they should have hired bantu lawyers if there any fine minds out there How do they know what Jonas is going to say in his enquiry? cezula. He already submitted an affidavit But that affidavit is only available to the judge and his team "Law students this bantu lawyer doesn't know the law I don't think the witnesses's lawyers are privy to that information 
2:31:00,2:33:49, "cezula I just wonder who planned the commission. #Why were the notices delayed? "all I see here is a severe ignorance to how government That's a different platform NOT this one! This commission has got nothing to do with that press conference "in law Zuma and his stalling tactics yet again... lawyers make money out of this. They will request those documents in a letter No one has been accused anyone yet! The commission hasn't kicked off! It would take 9 generations for a poor South African to lift himself out of poverty if he started in 2018 
2:33:50,2:37:51, Time for another break ? "My MPA colleagues the damage our people have allowed by keeping ANC in power will take 100ds of years to fix. and we haven't even started yet.

2:40:42,2:43:36, I think our people have been left with a dependency culture - enforced by the apartheid regime. Our people are not taught to help themselves. to grow and to build we have a lazy culture of handouts. our industries are flooded with people who believe they are owed something rather than people willing to work and build. Where is EFF how are they going to participate in this process? The justice system in SA is selective "how do you apply to cross examine. hmm.the witnesses talk today and only after few days "Mthokozisi - lol why should the EFF get involved No enquiry for the real looters All the best "eff are implicated in all this 
2:43:54,2:45:23, another break bro another break This is a joke lol!!!!!!!!!! I am not coming to watch this nonsense "Without EFF this whole will be boring the elections will come and go and this inquiry will still be going "he is skinny The ANC has spent enough money on land redistribution to buy ALL agricultural land 4 times over. But are happy to deceive our people into thinking it's their constitution that's preventing it...
