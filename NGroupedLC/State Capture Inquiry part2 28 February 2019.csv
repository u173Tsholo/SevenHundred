No wonder he was dumped "Just asking cause we used to play rugby against Capricorn Silili was there?? Oh! Signing in... "Cowards r not worthy to govern Most cabinet ministers know very little about their portfolios so many looking for a Guptarish person to make decisions for them. "Correct. Entrenched and very backward @Peet Venter​ Is it perhaps not a cultural thing not to confront an ""elder""?" guys the real stories are coming up now

Very unfortunate for the rest of the country. just served for 18 months! poor him! The ANC cadres knew exactly was going on that is why they did not bother to ask Zuma why is this happening. Sahara took More Money than Bosasa 
50:26,51:51, @Sofia Sofia true..if you dont tow the line you bite the dust of unemployment A former minister???? - can't believe that. More will come after this pa @Felix Muyoba what a sad shame ! "@Makho Theo  Zuma must be in jail @Sofia Sofia yeah "we wanna know who were those pp who told you that guptas wanted to see you so the country was run from the Gupter compound. 
51:56,52:42, WHT NOT just tell us ! "You will speak bafo @Paul Mufhadi imagine!! the reason for this capture is to know the makes ...RIGHT ? Nowonder what Zuma says now he directed implicated now Facebook 2009 to 2019 February By "This one will speak comrades Out with the names - say it - purge Makho Theo 
52:43,54:08, Minister of Communications? 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ @John James how can we help the Bantu govern better? The ANC leaders are shameless. Jacob Zuma destroyed so many people's both political and academic careers bcos of his greediness mr nyanda u are closing the rank whr is the truth here in this s.c "@Myka'al Daud @Felix Muyoba this is sick 😀 😀 😀 same thought here @Moira T ​Minister of Communications? mafias

Mbalula ngangimhlonipha uyaz @Sibangani Dube from what konje??? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 hay wena top 6 must all fall on their sword AND NOT Msholozi if this is true from cde Sip Will those ANC members implicated in this commission campaign for ANC in this coming elections? no jail ......... sequestrate them all their monies including state pensions What I don't understand is that they are not scared to implicate ZUMA but scared to mention other names ? So who really are the backbones ? Zuma was not confronted about this cause it is ubaba finish en klaar @Thabang Fact ? That’s thee issue 
58:31,1:00:37, John including Silili' I'm curious what will Mbulula say. Why didn't he reject the appointment when the president announced it. It raises eyebrows @Minah Makota agree "@John James he will come the is some sense in the ANC Maleka must grill Mbalula President didn't have a clue about running a country. That is the fault of the people who decided to make him president and the fault of the people who voted for a party who chose him as their leader @makhosi nobhatyi i agree ubaba is a great strategist 
1:00:40,1:04:17, Zuma had arms deal case hanging before becoming anc president but the ANC fools ignored Thambo Mbeki warning and went ahead to elect president John - where do you reside now? Not still in SA? This guys are cage. they are afraid to tell commission abt the enabler. cowards Psy - they want them to remain uneducated - none so blind. One tweet from ubaba and askaris gonna sing like canaries Zondo English lacks content @Yose......Bra...the truth is plain to see....nothing to do with race etc Out of context of a inquiry Mbaks is a Clown 
1:04:41,1:07:19, I think if there was enough time the whole NEC must come to Zondo commission I love Ramaphosa don’t change his stance to fight corruption and state capture he continued further to establish Siu tribunal look Money we lost and authorities must act put criminals behind bars @Frank Kgwedi agree Chief of ANC campain is corrupt< "Malema supported the illiterate Zuma bcos he was a grassroots leader from Nkandla individual and collective enabler of corruption ANC They knew all these and they chose to keep quiet yet the country was being sold. Now the country must give them chance? I do not think so. I'm waiting to see if anybody gets to be held accountable under Ramaphosa. He was 2nd in command during Zuma's reign. He has a lot to account for. Why did he look the other way? "Its clear we have cows in that NEC - they are loafers 
1:07:35,1:11:08, "Malema told the Parlianmnt long ago  very much true Zuma couldn't draff a agenda for the cabinet ministerial When things don't go right with the ANC/EFF...the Race Card Always gets played...Ne... @John...heheh....spot on @Felix Muyoba a bantu told m that they want t chane s.a to azania just think how to get money for a population of wives n girlfriends The abuse of government in South Africa means that government has become an abuser of the citizens. We need to find a new way to govern ourselves. 
1:11:21,1:13:09, This started during 2009 @Fils de l'homme i support that name "@Paul @Felix Muyoba it is Caucasian name "Shocked as usual "this thing  "😀 😀 ❤ @Myka'Al Daud​ Shocked as usual Who is this guy? General... General ... 
1:14:06,1:16:10, "that why the President need to be voted directly by the citizens n no by the mps eish We need to forget about race. It's used as an excuse but never as a reason. "so what is the NEC for if they do not hold each other accountable for the things they do or say @Felix Muyoba yes eish @Fils de l'homme redeployment He mumbled something about the SABC hahaha Yose stop botting this is not mmo game NEC is same as AU - club for abusers. 
1:16:14,1:20:21, Please Nyanda don’t fear implicate people 📻📺🛰🎤🔊🤣🎶🧐 Hahaha - Amnesia SHEM there is no point off this capture if they withhold crucial info ! what was the Answer ???? even if u dint understand .. tell us we will help you understand !
