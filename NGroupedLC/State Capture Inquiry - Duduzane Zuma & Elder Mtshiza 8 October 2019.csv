37:00,37:58, Pretoris Boys High is not a private school @zakes om BS - Thuli Madonsela ordered that Zuma could not appoint judge or set up commission because he was implicated. Why not question Duduzane and Jonas together in front of everybody?? that way the other can refute/engage the claim in real time as we're been give 2 versions of same event.

40:53,41:49, DZ lies are catching up with him now this young guy is very pompous There is no state capture by the Guptas but they had favor and potential to rival replace the old apartheid companies that monopolize eskom tenders @SACR FOUNDATION Zuma appointed Zondo as a judge but didn't appoint him to run this commission. "he is a smooth operator "I man confused "@Zolani Chosi Zondo was not picked up by Zuma He was prepared to interfere on allegations about Fana & Jonas BUT doesnt want to interfere when Jonas & his Father are implicated. @TheC4RB1N3 Zuma was not allowed to put names forward because he's a crook.
