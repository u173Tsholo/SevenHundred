WMC have contracts fr 80 years😁 and thy supply 95% of coal. but we r worried by 5% of Gupta. like really now 🤔 Duduzani Zuma for president he was the boy to the guptas that is why the Jonas issue was just 1 of many corrupt deals dudu was involved with 
26:16,26:59, "i'll bet the Gupta's ""facilities"" all had recording devices for black mail" He's lying - his lips are moving. "duduzane too young to be involved in this matter curries The term WMC does not mean one hates white people in general..!! why he was involved in government cz no one employed him 100% bullied in school Duduzane Zuma planned this with uncle Fana @Sthakathi Khumalo Pull the other one. 
27:03,29:01, i wonder if uncle fana is married to one of his aunt's live th boy alone "WMC is Bell & Pottinger  Uncle Fana was involved in the arms deal This guy is lying through his teeth 😂 He is the Guptas right hand man and gave the Guptas the key of South Africa with all these meetings he never had at the same venue "@Elliot Chauke those 90 year contracts did not create 400bn debts in Eskom and lying with a straight face "@Eliot Chauke

29:46,30:29, WMC!!!!!!!! 🤣😂 "Is the commission going to do some independent investigations? Like tracking cellphones rehearsal at play Duduzane clearly went to a private school Eliot if you know the best practice of business you would know that Exdom had a perfect business set up. to get coal at the lowest price from a mine that supplied the coal at a guaranteed price. "He doesnt know he is lying "White Monopoly Capital is also brainwashing African children under the guise of ""education""" "HI Rudi 
30:31,31:20, Duduzane rehearsed his answers PBHS r we in a court now "He wanted to have this meeting in an office environment? With printers Where is the Tablet😏??? The Commission never send 80 questions to former president as indicated by media last weekend.Again this is a testimony of how the media mislead & feed us with lies due to bias in reporting.

32:42,33:54, Since when does a young boy mediate between two grown men in our culture? Did Duduzane sort rumors before with other people? Why this two comrade? who woudnt? @theka Mercury @Eliot Chauke...... I don't do stupid..... you are blocked. "Nolunthando @zakes om remember Zondo was appointed by ZUMA and zuma knows that chair will never drag him under the bus "Don’t come with that ageism thing wena Why do Duduzane only have white lawyers? @Bev Daniels thanks will do 👌🏽 
33:55,34:37, @Eliot Chauke valid points you are raising my brother Who is this guy cross examining Duduzane? he is starting to sound like the GUPTA's iceboy... The rumour story just doesn't make a sence Dudu looks smart and confident @Zolani Chos I thought Zondo was appointed by CJ Mogoeng but you eplain He is Guptas ice boy Zolani you are lying Zondo was not pointed by Zuma stop lying please do some check up don't rush to comment 
34:46,35:30, "Daniel it is his own advocate "Eskom is corrupt You appoint whom ever you want as your lawyers!! he's a billionaire broke people please listen hey people These are not his parents and in fact he had never met Mr. Jonas before. I guarantee you Mr. Jonas only agreed to meet him because he was the Presidents son. i like this guy exactly @Sthakathi Khumalo Yes Zondo was apointed by Zuma this commission was appointed by Zuma 
35:42,36:46, ANC PEOPLE OLD MAN CONTROL BY DUDUZANE 😂😂😂😂😂😂 the nation of incompetence will be swollowed whole by any one with the money "@TheC4RB1N3- ​Eskom is corrupt GT you asked how can a young man mediate and I gave you my scenario.. you are just not being genuine to this conversation!! Eskom is corrupt its not rocket science its a fact You can use common knowledge "He looks smart and confident since he went to private schools This guy is wasting time Dudu has been trained how to lie . 
37:00,37:58, Pretoris Boys High is not a private school @zakes om BS - Thuli Madonsela ordered that Zuma could not appoint judge or set up commission because he was implicated. Why not question Duduzane and Jonas together in front of everybody?? that way the other can refute/engage the claim in real time as we're been give 2 versions of same event. "I'm not even focusing on what he's saying Zondo was appointed by mogoeng People are hurt here cause there are no explosives... @Thandeka Pretty Nhlabatsi i'm also cute Zondo was picked out by Zuma yes True :@Jason Mclari 
38:00,38:52, kodwa waba njani uZondo abuye angasizwa kahle isilungu 😂😂 he must like curry too "@Eliot Chauke you are 100% correct Thandeka why are you like this?? Corrupt money apparently makes people attractive😝😝 @TheC4RB1N3 No he wasn't - that's BS. a blatantly convincing lie "@Zakes Om remember it was not Zuma who wanted this commission Zuma didn’t want these proceedings happened I believe he still does  "@Rock882 Josh this country is k##ked eskom used to own its own coal mines 
38:54,39:35, @xhanti😂 go check what happened This is just a waste of time.. mac @khumalo thats so true 😂😂 "n June 2017 appointed by Mogoeng And a waste of tax payers money 
39:47,40:52, @TheC4RB1N3 You go and check. Madonsela ordered that a commission be set up and that Zuma could not select because he was implicated. Check. Zondo will see through all his charm and lies @TheC4RB1N3 Exactly. why is nobody asking about the content of the so called rumour? die ver;ore seun is terug die laaitjie kan baie mense leer om hoe vir hulle self te sorg word president seuntjie @Jane .Blamire what lies "Zuma put the names forward he is a lambchop this one Madonsela has refuted claims made yesterday by DZ regarding the PP report 
40:53,41:49, DZ lies are catching up with him now this young guy is very pompous There is no state capture by the Guptas but they had favor and potential to rival replace the old apartheid companies that monopolize eskom tenders @SACR FOUNDATION Zuma appointed Zondo as a judge but didn't appoint him to run this commission. "he is a smooth operator "I man confused "@Zolani Chosi Zondo was not picked up by Zuma He was prepared to interfere on allegations about Fana & Jonas BUT doesnt want to interfere when Jonas & his Father are implicated. @TheC4RB1N3 Zuma was not allowed to put names forward because he's a crook. 
41:57,43:03, Stories Stories Just a waste This advocate is marvelous DZ must tell what is that rumour that needed him to go as far as arrange the so called meeting @Xhanti Silvester he is not credible Ull had an entire day to sort this out 🙄unorganized these people Zuma knew he was gonna get Zondo @Sthakathi Khumalo Yes - you can't trust anything about him - not even his accent. "Thulz Nkoni you are spot on this thing of pages also now 
43:05,44:02, is he leading evidence now? @TheC4RB1N3 BS "Rumour Zondo was appointed by JZ @rosalind gerber are you sure thul is credible? they are all crooks and not very intelligent ones either but thats no sweat most of our people arent very intelligent either "we're you the Director of Oakbay  duduzani looks relaxed hey! he knows papa got his back by the pp 
44:02,44:29, The rumour was Jonas's allegations that duduzane was involved with criminal activities with the guptas He is trying to crack him "Bottom line is under Zondo Did Duduzane search the whole house to see if the Guptas were there? Only president can choose who to work on Commission what a waste of time. i'm out. "Zuma appoints state capture commission Derek Main The young man has learned a lot from his daddy😂😂😂😂 "His memory is back 
44:33,45:39, Turn up the heat advocate Well taught by Butterhead and the Guptas Worse liar than snr.Stealing money from the poor and still have the guts to lie straightfaced Printing? I thought he had a concern about the environment @Sthakathi Khumalo Yes - both consummate liars. DZ won’t crack environment - have you seen the water he drinks? "we all know he is daddy Another one who can’t remember a couple years back but can remember 2012 down till 1994 🙈 its about time 
45:42,47:31, Zondo is talking at a snails pace 😏 "That isn’t water LL1= Jacob...... LL2= Duduzane......LL3= Edward next time he will be chairperson of the commission. Ruppert must come... he must answer on the allegations of Currency manipulation. together with Maria Ramos he doesn't look well uDCJ "Forget it This is his advocate. His sole reason for being there is to make DZ look credible! dean marais can yu remember wat time yu ate yo lunch last week tuesdy 
47:47,49:08, @TheC4RB1N3 No surprise. He does not seem very intelligent @Eliot Chauke Is that state capture? Duduzane Zuma lied to Zondo commission -Thuli Madonsela @I Am Free 😂 @Kagtule...it all boils down to who owns the media... "Songezo that’s is scientifically correct yeah lol 😂 
49:12,50:45, No but I can remember what I ate if I had a 5 course meal my friend @samkelo Duduzane learned from the best! like father like son Can the Zupta apologists engage on the facts and not try to take us on a tangent or chase our tales. @nkagisang Hilda Masha Yes - they both have the criminal gene. The problem with him is he also adds accent to his teachings and ziyanyisa lezizinto😂😂 @Derek @free Ruppert said Zuma must replace Des Van Rooyen as Finance minister otherwise they(WMC) will bring the Rand to its knees. "guys "@nkagisang Hilda Masha best at stealing Mlamuli yes!!

Mbalula testified under Oath 🤯 Thanks Paul he remembers well the older events than the newer events. not as forgetting as his father though @Eliot Chauke Duduzane is testifying under oath and lying through his teeth. What's your point? Zuma was hiding himself with privilege to appoint and fire without disclosing reasons. When a company fire you must give you reasons derek main do yu have evidence dt zuma is corrupt @free my source is Mbaks not CiC as in the now rich big 6 in the anc NEC SAME WC big 6 we will be screwed 
53:07,54:05, the reference to WMC is absurd - what about BBBEE @derek Duduzani is an Honest man "according to Duduzane Derik Main is a lie detector @rosalind gerber it's as absurd as black economic vandalism "think again about Thuli majority of SA is preeeeettttyyyyy stooopid @Samkelo Nxele Yes - there is plenty of evidence that has been voiced here. He also fought tooth and nail to stop spy tapes. Schabir Shaik was found to have a corrupt relationship with Zuma. Plenty. Nope was nearly followed by My Guy haha

And furthermore Stop lying kid. You skipped the country with your Gupta mates when you knew you were being investigated! The PP said they even offered to go to Dubai but you declined But yesterday he said Thuli never gave him an opportunity to tell his side of the story? @Samkelo Nxele gordhan and mboweni are just about the only anc members that aren't corrupt @derek which version do u find convincing? btwn Jonas and Zuma jr? on the question i askd bfr agge shame..

Zuma has everything to lose if Jonas is correct. There was no need because many of her other reports released and finilized by the current PP "Thuli gave him many opportunities but he was always saying he is busy Were you invited na? "The country is captured by a new group every year 
1:00:34,1:01:22, the police and the hawks are in the corrupt governments pocket duuuuuhhhhh @Samkelo Nxele there's no such thing as wmc Agree Derek Hawks captured That witch called Thuli Madonsela was abusing her powers and her office "does he have a wife or kids who is squeaky clean?

He wanted us to wait for him to come back to the country? @Danie Nilsen - catch its our fault Thuli Madonsela offered to send her investigators to Dubai. He has no excuse WE DONT BELV U you will definitely have your chance to say plenty when you face corruption charges liar but you are a criminal and a face of corruption

1:07:36,1:08:22, @JoziTube I tend to agree with you but am hoping that's not the case. @Sfiso EFF put impeachment motion. Zuma realised he lost ground in anc and wont survive EFF motion. the best thing was to resigned. ANC defended Zuma 8 times in Parliament. 2 times during NEC meetngs imagine msholozi singing mchini wame next to Oscar pistorius in jail the same way his father use to answer in parliament is the same manner he is following...smooth answering "Well rehearsed or not here it comes "duduzani is not going to escape Mr...Jonas must come back.....Why is he wasting governments time and money..with this lies.. "waste of money and time  
1:08:27,1:09:22, This lawyer think he is doing the best for Duduzane but the judge can see through that he is lying. So where did he make his money? en pappa zuma het by atul se skouer gehuil sy laaitie is unemployed "@JoziTube - what "@Eliot Chauke  The more you talk the more you implicating yourself DZ 🙈and your not looking honest with your odd smiles and laughs when answering serious questions check his eyes gupta sop chicken en curry @Peter Sant Why was he not put in jail...when he ws arrestee..

The next thing we will be told to forgive and forget. Zondo feels left out even!! @Khulekani Thabethe ...and you are a judge @ mike..he is a smart kid..he doesn't look at foreigners as job snatches..he made his money local and abroad 
1:10:40,1:11:20, "For all those insulting this great and successful business man crime and corruption has no colour...crime is crime finish en klaar.. "@eugene So now they are bringing Gupta statements... or am listening to something else 😎 Hai SOUTH AFRICA is a problem here..........

Too late now. @ Parabrdge you are dead right..critics are losers Ngoako it only works when it's a black man lol "Duduzane did well on handling the commission's evidence leaders "Duduzane wasn't present for the entirety of that meeting !!! YESSSSS please conclude. @damaking alie. cr is not stupid like Zuma.he does not take decisions without considering. Did everyone miss that? 
1:12:11,1:12:51, He has been arranging meetings between different ministers and the Guptas and he thinks their evidence should be overlooked and only his version is the right one.Unyile. But doing what ?what service did he offer to who he’s worth hundreds of millions DUDUZANE LEFT THE MEETING TO WORK ON ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES with ONE OF THE GUPTAS time to make money not toytoy ‘White monopoly capital’: an excuse to avoid South Africa’s real problems @Iamfree you are a softy🤣✌ Tea time!!! The cakes fillings are melting CR17 is apologizing in Nigeria Nebraska making all sorts of promises this guy looks like Chester missing. 
1:12:58,1:14:07, Pls conclude without anymore explanations... Pls 😆😆😆😆 @Songezo Mangcotywa Surely that is just your subjective opinion about all of this. But I'm sure you were entitled to to them. I think Zondo is not done with this dude. Its coming after the break. Loving it. "Tea!! thank you "DUDUZANE left the meeting Us SAs are a wonderful bunch of jealous losers and lazy arses Is he the local “Gupta man” getting more money out ? Zondo is charmed he can't even speak. probably wishing it was his son who spoke so well 
1:14:18,1:15:10, Gupta speech writer 👍🏽 they should find out what Zuma jnr worth before his father became president of south africa and his assets will determine if he s corrupt or not thanks this dudu should becom a mediator. he mediated many deals We will support you all the way Duduzane Zuma. we won't allow whites and clever blacks to discredit you Marikana souls @Norma_Zwane can you please clarify your point? Dudu is so cute... dudzane was the set up man for the nene finance minister and the fukups after that let's go Bokke 
1:15:11,1:16:08, lots of expert here "Cyril got money from Oppenheimer... its fine. Zuma got money from Gupta hes free With money everything is possible DZ does not seem like the kind of man to take the bull by the horns - i cannot imagine him brokering a deal between two ANC heavy-weights the evidence leader looks angry then you got what Chauke @ Khulekani Thabethe here comes the race card Duduzane Zuma = Micheal Corleone 
1:16:10,1:17:43, when is Ramaphosa's sone coming to explain his share of events? we r also interested Khulekani Thabethe I'm with you.

1:18:15,1:19:05, ha ha sure wasting tax payers cash with this Zondo crap Really confused he was tinding on his phone lol "he was happy to be used @Greg Rowles .....if he is innocent.... I guess you believe in the tooth fairy as well? "Whether you are pro or anti DZ We are not all fools the truth will come out...its clear he benefited from his corrupt relations with the Guptas. 
1:19:08,1:21:44, standing on his phone Eliot * Transnet -the Gupta family earned R5billion for no work or value add at all! Oppenheimer didn’t @Moses typical poor lazy stuper "@Robert Russell he wasn't present for the offer to buy Nene Nepotism is for wankers and weaklings who are afraid to stand on their own 2 feet ls Andile gonna come as well i hate children of politicians who benefit from it dz n jz agreed to deny deny jz will aldo deny watch the space He was maybe not there but he knew was to benifit from it

The African population continues to grow at an unprecendented rate; it's rediculous Robert you are a fool...dirty child "we have over population Greg Rowles I agree Africans complain too much lol... we were too late to the education table "@Moses Sandile 
1:30:25,1:31:30, @Moses Sandile. White people dont understand what white priviledge is and dont even bother explaining. They think u re guilt tripping them if you try "You going to hurt yourself African culture... rather be on the job than go to work!

"then I wana be the errand boy.. I mean "He used the word ""runner "" which is commonly used by employers in India. Witnessed it first hand." 
1:49:43,1:52:27, DCJ Zondo is not STUPID and he is NOT WEAK. He can see he is LYING Agree "There is something I don’t understand guys @Ayanda Kleyi You're right. Zondo must subpoena the Guptas. yes you right "they wasting time They have been subpoenaed. They refuse to come back to South Africa because they don't want to be in a South African prison. Looks like This Zuma was the Gupta Maia's bagman? 
1:52:45,1:54:26, enquiries should be dealt with the retired Judges not Zondo @Anne M. Oh Thank you. Maybe they should've sent some organisation to fetch them. "Yes lol They are trying to get them extradited @I Am Free ....all Zulus are Royalty @Ewald Kruger and barman. LOL Telling DZ he does not believe too much of what he said ☹ "Is State Capture only limited to Guptas and Zuma or they are looking at this thing holistically.. I am even confused

1:56:44,1:58:38, RWC about to kickoff Sounds like there was a fight after the meeting at the Gupta's. Duduzane is not coming out clearly on the matter. He keeps saying..it went the way it went.. They must have fought Goes to motive Agreement Mokoena you have a problem Mr DCJ? Agreement you have a problem with DCJ/ my big question y feel de need to find a office facility if there aint gonna b minutes my point is there was no need to use the gupta residence is any of those office equipment were never used OK Duduzane said previously we left the meeting for some administrative issue (with one of the Guptas) *he left "no Sir am just concern about this judge Zondo that 
1:58:47,2:00:37, Dudu has so much of money his advocate is smiling it's just hearsay where is the actual evidence? nehh what's going on here? "You controlled the SAPS Lets share the concern?
