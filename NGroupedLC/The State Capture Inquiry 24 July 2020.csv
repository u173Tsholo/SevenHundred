21:31,27:05, These criminals use the law as a weapon against justice @Hubert Maphumulo Exactly. two weeks and nothing happens "don't trust this Zondo thing @Norma such valuable time "Fraser is just threatening theres nothing explosive @Hubert Mr Zondo is very much aware of the ultimate consiquences if he allows Fraser to testify They must just stop this thing cos it is going no where and just waisting our money Wish the Judge will now come down hard on these shenanigans and this rambling on 
28:11,31:07, Yes grill him Mr Chair She could've watched the recorded evedience. The postponements are too much and costing South Africans too much. The chair needs to put his foot down. Postponement not medical related then show up. "@Wendy Greeff lol Oh really want to do with it That is that a delaying tactic "exactly mmmmmm the guilty always try run away. Who wants postponement here? 
31:19,33:13, we want blood. I have now lost all patience with this rambling idiot rotten from the top Zondo is upset with the judge. i smell a rat Send the judge an Uber - now. """ DCJ MUST SUMMON HIS COLLEAGUE They have not acted diligently! is it treasonous to say that the ANC is the worst political party that ZA has had in the past 400 years. if not then I say it. 
33:47,36:36, kuyadlalwa lies of high note Lies has become a hobby for thieves nowadays. hahahahahah lies this guys is lying in the eyes of zondo why not just say the dog ate her notes. zondo take not this lies wow wow wow NWO is alive and well.

Who's this person referred as 'she'? A female JUDGE> Zondo must precisely deal with this inappropriate conduct and punish them accordingly...amanga wodwa lawa a corrupt Judge. will get interesting. 
39:22,43:25, Who's that judge? "who is ""her""" She cant give evidence because she had a wheel puncture and is traumatized?!!!! Please.... these excuses are ridiculous. Makubela. all lies """ IF SHE DOES NOT COME HERE He’s given her no option but to come. "If she doesn’t 😂 😂 hectic 
43:56,55:57, Hope she is ready to be grilled without mercy for her failure to be present. Is it teatime as only logged on now Bev. The Judge is scared of Zondo and does not want to come to the Commision. Scared to death for sure Is it tea time. yes tea time "Bev They'll be back in a minute "Makubela will be summoned to appear monday 
56:14,1:02:18, Zondo ordered her counsel to contact her. Scroll back in tape later to see how lame it is "she will attend today "The only people that need to be scared of the Inquisition are heretics. You aren't a heretic Judge ​Makubela? what is she thinking with that lame reason that she cant be there as long as you don't expect anything to be done on time. A calendar or hourglass maybe but not a watch Just switched on. Are they on break? How dare she disrespect the Commission by being absent with such a lame excuse I wonder if somebody threatened her not to appear? Why wouldn't she contact the commission? Can't understand a judge behaving like this. 
1:03:04,1:08:07, Wasn’t it a 15 minute break kanti ? It was.... "aybo asinaxesha bakwethu her phone is switched off because she's getting a brain scan maybe... Supposed to be back at 10.55. Something going on. 😂 @Peet Venter "Shakoane waste of tax payers money. This Will go on for ever with no prisoners. like everything else with the looting gangsters Hello..its not about you answering not excuses after excuses 
1:08:32,1:11:48, I'm gatvol with these people! we are taken for fools here LIES LIES LIES Ridiculous she is scared of something I didn't ask 🙃 makes sense at all. i didn't expect that from a judge A so called freedom fighter is soo fragile to appear from a mere tyre bursting. WHAT A LOT OF RUBBISH. this Shakoane character??? 
1:12:01,1:14:16, she is guilty and she took part in corruption apparently her brain is connected to the tire "Shakoane SC is at pains to defend the indefensible hogwash hogwash hogwash Is senior counsel a relative of hers? Why is he so tentative? What kind of lawyer doesn't ask such important questions? @Siyanda Ntloko it does not make any sense this commission needs to bark and bite More than 5 months she has known! 
1:14:55,1:21:04, The witness {A Judge} has such scant regard for the commission. The accident is a cover up and a layman's manipulation of processes. LAME. This is the biggest joke .... welcome to ANC rule of law the judge is riding the commission Another sad day in our country "@xolani. Nothing is going to come out of this commission. Waste of tax payers money like the rest of the anc theft . Till today not much progress """ JOHN PUBLIC COULD HAVE BEEN DRAGGED KICKING & SCREAMING 2 APPEAR ""!!!" @ yoga . Halala Maybe she wished the Tyre bust had killed her...:virtualhug::virtualhug: Why can't McBride have her picked up and taken in for questioning? Is there a legal person here? 
1:21:56,1:25:03, I didn’t know you can buy minister by whiskey and chicken @ Sam i think the same too. Why does she think she is so important that she can show Judge Zondo a middle finger? High Court Judge !!!!! What is her first name @ William showing the middle finger is the norm I hate her and I don't even know her. SHE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND SHE ALSO KNOWS HOW TO ACT. WHAT SHE KNOWS ALSO VERY WELL IS THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO HER.🤷🏾🤷🏾 She has a nerve.....!!!!! 
1:25:11,1:27:22, What a disgraceful act. Now DCJ is mad. Can this dcj not issue a warrant summons She must get a 4 ball "William - me too """ 2 SECURE HER ATTENDANCE This guy is very relaxed. I would have list it by now "She must come we still waiting for Zuma's day in court. lol 
1:27:31,1:29:26, Who captured the country and who sold it Outrage would be better The commission should and must operate on summons henceforth. The rules permit and the circumstance around that also necessitates such. ANC sold it to China "@ William yes would like to see that day. I don’t remember “Why did she accept appointment to chair PRASA when she had already been appointed as a judge?” it might still happen Siyanda. 😂😂😂😂 This guy must get his backside kicked 
1:29:30,1:31:21, she knows that this commission is a spaza Shop "some lawyers are useless  Excuses excuses excuses blah blah blah When the commission has totally collapsed? @William Pieters And this is senior counsel incompetent She is on drugs Shame no one be blamed the lawyer reminds me of a prophet in some funny church. 
1:32:10,1:33:36, "Lol @William Pieters  Prophet in training I don’t know what are watching here any of them with Prophits. @ shumba listening to two waffling What did Plato say? 🤣🤣🤣 what? bla bla bla blacome on....going nowhere slowly.... Can the network be disrupted please 
1:34:02,1:36:18, a whole judge! she had an accident yesterday and crashed the car and is stressed today and can't make it. this commission is degenerating into a tragic farce High court Judge Zondo just making sure this all goes on record. William - ALLEGEDLY Is this man really senior council or a flipping law student?!!!🤔 "she never intended to come to the commission  weak and lame and feeble 
1:36:32,1:38:46, lol Person there is a lot of in-activity to this character This Senior Council got his training on a puppet show. Shame my brother he is not a live wire lawyer at all """ SAW A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT & NOW SEVERELY TRAUMATIZED ""!!!" we all need to go back to Botes testimony and do our homework for Monday where is Hoffmeyer?? 😂😂😂😂 
1:38:51,1:41:29, "That much is accepted @William Pieters  useless unprepared lawyers here @Duduzekile please go get her quickly Mr Softvoice is very low energy. I don't think he likes his client. Zondo not accepting this bs Come on judge its almost 2hrs @ Njabulo i think I should check the google maps for her address 😂😂 how much has it cost the country so far for this BS? it getting to be life esidimeni 
1:41:49,1:44:37, Google map her adress. let her come tomorrow DCJ is not playing games "Yay! Action 😂😂😂 yebo tomorrow😆 Tomorrow please YOU ATE YOU ATE TELL THE TRUTH AND BE FREE LIKE A BIRD let her come tomorrow 😅😅

1:49:38,1:58:11, 2 Hours later we are still no where? she'll b experiencing traumatic pains tomorrow "XAU USD GOLD the yellow metal is consolidating after hitting a fresh 9-year high at $1898. The near term resistance is around $1900 "this remind me when i was a candidate Attorney in 2001 """ WAIT 4 DE ' FLASBACKS""!!!!" is still look down. she need to come tomorrow. This man is very respectful of this disrespectful and lying woman. person of interest guard your prejudices and sexist nature What sex am I? what prejudices? 
1:59:30,2:02:35, then 1 can say judge Makhubele is 1 unscrupulous judge thanks xolani is Makhubele in any way related to Mkhwebane? Please Zondo....fast forward now..... @Mkhaya why relations? Clear that she has been giving everybody the run-around all along They all tiptoe round her and she went from reluctant to hostile Hiding behind the loopholes in the law shouldn't be allowed - even if she is a judge who has proven to have scant regard for the low Wendy that's for sure. Hope Z insists that she appear tomorrow 
2:03:49,2:07:38, It is like nailing jelly to the wall How can this woman still be a judge how did she get to be a judge in the first place? We are all asking ourselves who chose her?? is she captured?? Four people implicated her The same JSC that has been investigating Judge Hlope for the past 10 years we need to connect the dots 
2:08:04,2:13:02, What wrong did she do? Gud day fellows she delayed that investigation """ THE ABSENT JUDGE CANNOT B' FIT & PROPER' IN DE EYES OF THE LAW.LET US HOPE DE JSC HAS HER UNDER DE RADAR""!!!" and take as long a they do - she will be retired before anything happens @dennis oldude by the time they finalise it..he will have millions of provident fund.he wont have anything to worry about even if sanctioned. So she is renowned for her delaying tactics Trust me I am a judge? she is still continuing with the same tactics 
2:13:29,2:15:30, "Yes in the footsteps of J'Kop the purpose is to sabortage the commision I like your tone DCJ the DCJ is ballistic Thinks she has more power because she is a judge....embarrassing to say the least.... So happy he's getting mad. the old man is mad Focus camera on her lawyer pls lol

2:21:51,2:23:35, first time to see Justice Zondo this angry 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this little guy is a bit disorganised zodo is about to explode 🤣🤣🤣 I will advice judge Makhubela to get a new lawyer.. this one cant even speak up. """ COUNSEL IS ENTERING THE FRYIING PAN/ EASIGAS""!!!" @chake karabo he is a ticking boom.. it's like back at school speaking in front of assembly 🤣🤣😂😂mumbling and fear "I am pulling my hair out 
2:23:44,2:25:41, Hi really must judge read cause this guy struggling @Level Ground Boerboels those lawyers from streets post..who are charge R49/per hour Wasting time...... 👍🏾 Judge Z gonna bring her tomorrow... this poor dude also doesn't know what he's doing there..he was told to wear a suit and a mask. "@person if interest 🤣🤣🤣 this guy though The behaviour of a judge? Really? Zondo.. is now on another level. summons will be issued now 
2:26:10,2:27:50, "This guy he's just here to waste time real mickey - mouse """ GRILLING TIME ""!!!!" Is this man her brother or what? Lol Mr Softy This guy is simply not prepared. I can speak better than him😀 what is this guy saying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 he is confused which university did this guy study? 
2:27:52,2:29:03, This guy frustrates me remotely getting to his point.. how must Zondo be feeling 😡 who is this guy?? I'm in DRC dis commission it's on another level this Counsel should learn that Zondo is getting upset now and he should not argue further. """ JUDGE MUST CHECK DE QUALIFICATIONS OF THIS GUY""!!!" she can because. also when you said and that she was maybe i need to call her and i probably say and my limited instruction This muppet must just take his L and leave. confused really One can see his anger by the nose rising now and then. 
2:29:14,2:29:53, he bought his degree We seriously need to check this guys qualification. He is even inviting sympathy from DCJ. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 we all sympathise with this boy shame. he is getting embarrassed Aah this guy keeps on touching files without anything helpful amateur His client threw him under the bus I'm still not hearing what he's trying to say 🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️ I feel so sad if people of Makhubela's caliber can act this way. I feel so sorry DCJ Zondo the wheels of justice are not turning faster because of attitudes like Judge Makhubele to the commission Just dismiss counsel and bring her. 
2:30:01,2:33:58, i hope she is watching this mess..her mess No....No...No..change of plan..lets ask for this guy's papers Really trying everybody's patience - Judge Z especially !!!!! Waste of tax payers monies........this is becoming a joke..... "Not a waste of tax payers money "I don't know law but I need to ask Cant he realize he should step down now "@sylveigh peggy ummm...errrrrrr...ummmm.....errrre....arg !!!! 
2:34:07,2:35:07, yoh zondo's eyes. this man is serious @chake karabo yes they said that.. if she is lying in this attempt to delay appearing would that be grounds for impeaching her? now this is where she realises that no one is above the law. she is now wanted yo come in person no more excuses. What's the excuse gonna be now ? 🤔 @ayanda khinzi focus in what... Red tie magic only works when it is worn by that KZN mafia This kind of incompetency is even worse if committed by a judge. This guys face says it all 
2:35:12,2:37:07, """DCJ IS BURNING INSIDE""!!!!" Send Uber now! @ayanda khinzi focus on what? Feeble arguments playing for time the dude must get in his polo vivo and not come back.. If only we going to see more arrests "I agree """ FIASCO DAT A SITTING JUDGE CAN FRUSTRATE JUSTICE ""!!!!" @Level Grond Focus on the essence and leave the phenomenon. EG. You talking about a waste of tax payer money & others talking about the lawyers papers. 
2:37:08,2:38:29, @Katlego😂😂😂😂 "What's so difficult in saying to the Chair Realizing they have nothing but time on their side. DCJ Zondo is trying so hard to keep his cool. if i were judge Makhubela i would tell my legal team that I am kn my way to the Commission 😀 Quinton Ndzinisa - can we please start with her arrest? @ chaka karabo that is how lawyers address each other in court "Surely the commission must take cognizance of the comments in the chats Why this Makhubela can not come and dance for her music she seems to run with a very crucial information "Exactly 
2:39:07,2:43:20, @Level Grond Focus on the fact that Judge Zondo is not impressed &wants to get to the bottom of this ASAP. And the poor lawyer there is representing a Judge & his client is out of order We are being hoodwinked. Our intelligence made a joke off Even the legal team is now giving everybody the run-around @ayanda khonzi. u are sick. read what I wring. I never talk about lawyers papers and tax money. I responded on Sylvian or something about her saying they are wasting our tax money.. seeking relevance "You go Have they adjourned for a friday buffet lunch? @sorry Ayanda khonzi. what I say here have nothing to do with u. dont read. and who said we are not focus when we interact. we were not talking to u. "Hubert "@Level I know 
2:43:35,2:46:02, I’m very humbled by how poised and stern Zondo has been throughout this engagement. I would’ve summoned her by now She clearly have no intension of making herself available for tomorrow - hence this lengthy adjournment I used to have SO much hope in this commision. But it has become a farce. The criminals are calling the tune. TSEK @Dominic Przybylski it is a short adjournment to allow Advocate Shakoane SC to consult Judge Makhubele. The sitting shall resume shortly "Nkosi @sabc thank you That judge Makhubela is playful "@Level: So I was also responding to Sylvian and someone's else while I was at it. Now there is not need to call me sick @SABC is she even contactable ? Did the phone get abducted to mars 
2:46:26,2:47:43, Makhubele is a disgrace. @SABC News Thanks. she can run but she can't hide...she must just appear before the Commission... If her lawyer withdraws she will demand time to brief her new lawyers. It's called the Zuma manouever. maybe not let's hear the other side first "This makes the whole process a joke Back! We resume I smell a “what’s his name” (Watson) 
2:48:03,2:50:03, The question i would like to ask is why are these people not treated as suspects arrested and allowed an opportunity in court rather than this comm "Nkosi What justice would you get from a court if the judges are corrupt @Derek. This shouldn't even be up for debate. Unless she is in ICU she can get in another car explain herself This country is nothing more than a playground for corrupt gangsters. "Emotional trauma my foot This commission is toothless(and spineless). No recourse in the event of a witness not showing up. Sheer contempt! send investigators to fetch her immediately @tim how about uber 
2:50:13,2:51:19, "Four witnesses implicated her can they check the authenticity of the pictures "An experienced lawyer would know what to expect and advise his client accordingly. Instead it's the client advising the lawyer what to say. In law school @Mohamed Mia it's 2020!!?? lol @wim same like Cyril no b****s agree wim ....going know where..... So what is the purpose of this comm @Nkosi.its a duplication of processes .Already over 700 m rands spent?? so a tyre burst! Send one of the Eastern Cape motorbike ambulances 
2:51:22,2:53:27, @ Dennis blue light brigade send defence force and air force to escort her Is the Judge trying to justify their salaries today.....dragging this out....since 10h00 this morning... @wilson maybe her brain burst. Or maybe nothing there "New dawn a judge?with these kind of excuses "Asked to advise our clients "I guess there’s more legitimacy Deputy Chief Justice - DCJ 
2:53:27,2:54:17, Zondo can apply his mind and issues a warrant of arrest for contempt of court or hearin She must be made an example of! As a non-lawyer I am 😳 embarrassed! issue warrant immediately straight! Agree Garth..... @mandla mngomezulu.. I am more embarrassed myself This guy sounds like he is dying But the matter will still have to go before a judge in court @Nkosi Da Perf Did somebody corrupt a tire? 
2:54:36,2:56:28, Summon her for tomorrow .... please Judge tyre his voice 😂😂 Tyre is a victim who has suffered? Tyre was injured. @Dominic 😀😀😀 the tyre that has suffered.. emm mmm eishh this guy is compromised "The sooner Zondo his powers to subpoena In the meantime time is running out 
2:56:49,2:57:56, How long is mourning period for a deceased tyre in South Africa? what circumstances 😂 whats the name of this counsel ohh shame ... We have had a total loss regarding the commission of enquiry this whole week. Period. do all the legal eagles need to take forever to say something - this guy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Deceased tyre 😂 @Dominic This comm will drag on till dooms day without an outcome....POLITICS POLITICS POLITICS 
2:58:00,2:59:34, does Zondo have the power to Summon or he will need to apply in a court of law to summon this Makhubela Whole day wasted Adjourned for lunch or what? "This is an embarrassing situation... please judge Zondo he will say she reply but it went on voice mail loool riyaad sampson....and tax payers monies..... Very true Peggy Don't worry everyone gets overtime if they sit on Saturday - maybe she should be made to pay for the time wasted and costs incurred as a result "@Siyanda 
2:59:35,3:04:17, voice go down wen someone is lying "All professions guys yay DCJ You go dcj Exactly @Mbuyiselo Malahle one's integrity and reputation is stake... at least a Dr's note would have done justice and not just random pictures Insist on tomorrow.....she has no grounds.....she is playing a game with Zondo...power play....who is going to win this round... "I am disappointed that Zondo is listening to this guy sorry 
3:04:43,3:07:01, Tyre punctures are traumatizing. what are you saying kahle kahle wena nkosi de perf "@level like she is going to admit There might not have been a tyre burst postponed until tomorrow please @Musa I am sure the DCJ has the same thought. Definitely I love judge Zondo ✌️ 
3:07:13,3:08:53, Judge Mlambo must suspend this Judge Mokobele mbize ksasa chair Mlambo must be watching Vish Govender - I wholeheartedly agree with you Tyre was punctured. Air was bleeding all over the place. Very traumatic. 😔 Another week. a week is sufficient DCJ "It's amazing that a judge There she won another week 
3:09:11,3:10:13, @Dominic Przybylski 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 but by Wednesday she should have filled He is much to lenient with her She must be gone fishing 🎣 He is BUT THE CAR HAS FOUR TYRES - SO FOUR WEEKS I would have rubbished the excuse and set it down for tomorrow and Sunday And she wins this round Get scooter ambulance from ec

3:12:28,3:17:10, Waste of time and money Respect for the DCJ. I hope that her Judge President also acts accordingly. it's tough hey @nkululeko mdluli she is afriad she will be exposed on her double dealings 💪🏿 is he gonna use muscle finally ? The commission must also compel Zupta to appear and finish his testimony. Time is of the essence. She's off the hook. All so predictable. "Agh How jz . What did I do wrong ? What state capture?
