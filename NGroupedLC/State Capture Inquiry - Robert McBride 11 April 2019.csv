8:01,9:31, "Eish @carnoth ngomane. Implicated also? jirrrr Zondo son also captured. same like zumas son and also Ramaphosa's son "This Pretorius clown is starting to work on my nerve dammit B-) @Desmond Masilela in one way or another @Welton we must hear the evidence first my 1st time following these SC inquiry @Eslon he has to outline to the Chairman how proceedings will go...very necessary 
9:31,10:55, "@Magda Seguin  @carnoth ngomane ü§¶ü§¶ damit!! "I have always maintained the view "David @welton paulse not zondo son but brother @welton...agree but we still need to hear the what and why "Where is Advocate Maleka now this matter must go back to mogoeng to check if he can't recuse Zondo. haikhona Dawid wellcome! Just be ready for some moronic comments! Best is to ignore them or block them??? 
10:59,12:25, At least on track. cerebisüòÅüòÅ "We will hear full of evidence about police "Apparently as soon as the NPA is ready during the commission zondo must recuss himself here you all globally ... me in NZ "mcbride is a real mk comrade "@Magda Seguin @romeo you are jumping the gun 
12:26,15:05, "Jip Magda @Thando Nkutha he chaired one of the disciplinary hearings concerning one of Mcbride's colleague Chair we are all in hot waters. "no he cant chair this one his must recuse himself I still have the first book McBride wrote about his imprisonment and being on death row Guys I'm lost. the adv is talking about recuse. Who should recuse himself? We are now going back to a situation like Omotoso or what? Zondo Desmond "@romeo shavhani Chief Justice must take over this case 
15:31,16:21, "@nkosi @romeo you have not even heard what it is about yet you make judgements...Pretorious is asking now but we don't know the details hence we can't just make judgements yes but he will only recuse himself only on evidence relating to his brother if he agrees to recuse himself the chair..becos McBride is goin to give evidence from an inquiry that was chaired by the DCJ younger brother who's an advocate some are blowing this out of proportion @romeo glad you see the light morning "you are wrong Mr pretorius I give up 
16:23,18:04, @Thando Nkutha you will never know with this people hey "Eish guys "those without facts sit down and relax  Who wants the chair to recuse himself? They are highlighting possibles problems. Very important that this testimony is not challenged later. "mzansi ubaba ka duduzane Please give us the details first before talking about recusal "DCJ don't fight it  @Thando Nkutha. Hi Thando 
18:05,20:02, no option for DCJ but to recuse. how will he subpoena his brother and cross examine him? "Guys are always admiring Miss Molefe "if Zondo does not recuse himself here @Thando Nkutha for justice and fairness he should recuse himself only on the part that involves his brother He is an investigator NOT a sitting judge in a court of law So is Zondo's brother involved in state capture? NO he was the lead in the McBride disciplinary The brother chaired an inquiry that McBride will mention in his evidence "@SP van Zyl  
20:08,21:35, @SP van Zyl implicated yes on McBrides evidence I am tired of explaining...just going to listen now "shame seems like family members with corrupt activities are everywhere "Ah ok No need of the President DCJ . Part of what Mcbride may speak to might make Zondo conflicted bcoz of his brother involvement I am sure that other Zondo guy works for Ace Welton you are missing the point 
22:19,24:14, "@Jane .Blamire  "this is what happens when you set up a commission to catch on person @Jane everybody jumps to conclusions on this thread...no discernment Shame the chair is caught between the rock and the hard call chief justice Mogoeng DCJ true Magda "So This commission is absolutely necessary...we would have carried on wondering why the country is bankrupt "Thank you Jesus  
24:20,26:28, Both Zondos are lawyers/judges chairing inquiries. Conflict of both inquiries have same witness. This is just a legal issue to make sure all done correctly "this was the downfall Thanks Jane you are correct "I feel sorry for Zondo Agree Magda. People must listen first before jumping to conclusions "we wasted 6 weeks of mcbride evidence. we the looks of things "Guys this is a no easy matter Zondo Jrr happened to be a chairperson of disciplinary inquiry. Agree Eslon. Very tricky 
26:40,29:09, All this is due to ANC factionalism.The top six are divided and give out conflicting statements on a daily basis Zondo must just listen and give the Chief Justice or public protector to make a decision public protector? Ok so what do want to know Michael üòÉ "the show must go on Non of the people involved objected or requested for the recusal of Zondo snr Pretorius won't agree Read Gangster State...Ace corrupted everybody...he wants eventually to be President "Jane. Blamire... Very much 
29:21,31:11, We have wasted lot of time with all this postponement. let the commission carry on. "@Jane .Blamire  "@mantana Zondo jrr is not intending to appear before the commission nor seek to cross examine Mc Bride Pretorius making absolutely that there are NO loopholes to protect this testimony THe legal team knew about this. Why didnt they raise then? @Dominic...correct Legal team is a bit disappointing I knew about that postponement on Monday that it will come with some other stories. 
31:13,32:25, They are now in public. "@seguin This testimony must be VERY important with all this fuss!!! who knows if the legal team are not being spooked...they are everywhere But this should have been dealt with long before we come on air. we cannot proceed That's why I said the other day that there's something about Mcbride's appearance here "@magda @Sfiso...The public must also be informed...joining the dots 
32:39,34:23, ku litüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ This legal team of the commission is not very hands on "Ngukayithobi was on PIC My favourite person Thembeka Eish! eish! Tembeka is even in the house Nevertheless Pretorious states aspects of law which governs recusal or non recusal thereof. "@nxumalo @Neo Mongale dreaming zzzzz Service delivery destroying DA/EFF coalition. 
34:26,35:54, Disagree Welton. All issues have to be brought forward in public I see NGQUZAKAYITHOBI is also here?! he drinks water The legal team is not very pro active but rather reactive "i came late  Who is Ngcukayitobi presenting? "@Desmond Masilela NGQUZAKAYITHOBI is here @peter pott and ATM is making inroads in by elections..Big surprise but no so big knowing that their electioneering are in churches "@Jane .Blamire 
36:03,38:21, Who is he presenting / representing? How much is Mr Pretorious getting paid per day or hour? How much is Zondo as well? @Desmond Masilela he is representing McBride Where is Mcbride van kaap? @Mr Jones Parker. Than you Jones. ANC is starting to behave like ZANU PF "I am sorry where Jimmy manyi is-Corruption is alive Certainly these story will resurface somewhat even if Zondo goes ahead now "@Seguin 
38:22,40:50, @sipho all liberation movements are the same @Afrika while there is humongous greed by our leaders nothing will happen Musa as far as I recall McBride is from north. (Gauteng?) "@and by the way "What Mr Pretorius is dealing with now Most state and government institutions are compromised by corruption yay mc slippery mcbride jim finaly in front of the people to a range a part of his pukings @cerebis u only want the part of naming ppl Mc Bride is from KZN...Wentworth to be exact 
41:17,44:23, ANC is panicking that it will loose GP so now they are causing havoc "Agree Magda thami salaries could range from 50k to 100k pd Is zit the ANC or residence- be clear I never denied that the private sector is also corrupt but the people entrusted with public money and purporting to serve the people are stealing on a grand scale #Neo Mongale-White monopoly right there @Afika Centane Agree - dealing with corruption is priority. what is worse the robbing the poor by goverment ae mc bride or apartheid where it was mentaly and phisical abuse why are you stalling - get on with the evidence - I don't see the purpose of this explanations. or maybe I just to eager to hear the evidence 
45:02,47:13, come back in a moment wow i must coin that "There is like 2K something of you watching I think the latter Ishaad....lol There seem to be high public interest in what Mcbride has to share with the commission today The dynamic between Cele and Mc Bride led to him being kicked out...The report Cele sent to the Police Committee in Parliament was damning that is why they ousted him...t Neo Mongale.....what wealth....it was stolen by the ANC Have patience Ishaad my bro. He‚Äôs just giving us context so when he explains how these structures have been captured you appreciate the gravity. "What is wrong within our minds "Maladministration by the ANC which Sampie Terreblanche already told us how the really state capture was done

1:07:44,1:09:34, @Sipho. Overdone introductions. He must just let McBride take stand..... @Magda Seguin NO Magda you misunderstand me!

Idiotic! .. @Masingita Character assasination?WOW! 
1:09:36,1:11:08, Jerrrr this guy is killing the vibe out of us. we want to listen Mcbride not you plz Pretorius I also want peace. The corrupt leaders are the ones trying to divide us.

Im just waiting for Mcbride to give his testimony. Because Pretorius is giving me hard time really "Magda this was not directed to you ANC is just iliterate sheep. BLF are racist. EFF are morons. DA are traitors. Who is left to save SA? 
1:14:59,1:16:25, Pretorius is setting the stage for thee missiles to be launched. magda when the blf leader states the same in public on national tv then its ok because it is he a blackman and when some one else do the sam on a aswer of another on this same page treathes that Pretorius and Maleka are the only Comm lawyers that present evidence diligently and it becomes easier for us with little knowledge of events ANC going down .....to vrot to govern @Neo Mongale Bra how much data did your handlers buy for you?

We shoild not believe any of the trite that is peddled by the likes Aubrey and Malema about the removal of Cyril. After the elections the SG and his deputy could be removed at the NGC WMC is a Bell Pottinger/Gupta invention..please stop using it! Wowüòì Stop these Julius Malema lies about the removal of Cyril. The ANC NEC has no power of removing an elected ANC president the cracks and factions within the ANC seem to have begun long long before the release of Mandela ...and most probably there were differences in ideology and strategy from way way back. 
1:21:54,1:23:30, At what time is McBride going to speak? Who is making sounds like a Hippo lol!! "Mzalwane NPA was obsolete. SHAUN the SHEEP must answer @Uncle Funk The ANC has a constitution. @ayanda correct...those who were in exile and those who remained in the country was already at loggerheads l'm already worried that lawyers of implicated persons might come back and technically say Mcbride evidence must dismissed bcoz the Zondo is conflicted of his brother's involvement in another inquiry yes in a moment pretoirus los die lip flappery en laat mc bride op die stand en jy moet jou fecluse jy is bais teenoor mc bride @Mzwalane Mzala Cyril would have one the ANC near two thirds majority and his arm will bw strengthened and his detractors will be removed both as cabinet ministers and position of influence.

THEIVES MUST BE REHABILITATE AWAY FROM A FUNCTIONING SOCIETY "Neo make that 4.5k ppl vote for the ANC cause the DA is the NP in disguise a person cant support your slave master The point is we want an honest contribution by McBride!! 
2:01:59,2:03:27, @Quintin Jacobs Get your facts right - the NP merged with the ANC. @Derek Main nope NP members joined the ANC cause they wanted to keep the salary most of the DA is NO @Quintin Jacobs So people who vote for the ANC are voting for the NP - not so? This is Africa we use the bones of our died people "@Bongumenzi Nxumalo he is resposable for the mcgoo *NP "Quintin the NP today is the ANC. thieves @Quintin Jacobs Did the NP merge with the ANC - yes or no. @Derek Main those NP members in the ANC is the minority 
2:03:36,2:04:53, @Derek Main no Can one trust a former terrorist @Quintin Jacobs I'm talking about the parties - not individual people. @Derek Main Who was the first leader of DA since it came to existence "da would be more corrupt than the anc "I see that the ANC lost Stellenbosch : DA = 98.7% the NP change to NNP and then the DP & the NNP merge @Derek Main @carnoth ngomane Helen Zille as far as I know. @Cedrick do you trust Zuma? 
2:04:59,2:05:53, Danie Nilsen I just want to know who in the ANC sent him because he said he will take that to death and if he doesn't how do we trust his contribution as honest.. @Frik Brits what do you expect from those statistics? it was Tony Leon @Quintin Jacobs Wrong - you are a revisionist. The NNP and the ANC merged. @Erin the ANC bankrupted the country already nothing more to steal "Neo "The Democratic Party (DP) ah finaly ah so nice word but now for the brake for tea there's always more to steal as long as people are paying taxes 
2:05:57,2:07:07, "@Felix Muyoba  ha ha "come on "former State President F.W. de Klerk relinquished his NNP membership """In 2000 the DP reaches a merger agreement with the Federal Alliance and the New National Party (NNP) """A year later the DA‚Äôs relationship with the NNP and former DP members breaks down and the NNP forms an alliance with the ANC."""

The Immorality Act was different. so many nut jobs on today. guess they all had there hands in the cookie jar and now trying to cause racial hate but will not work @Neo MongaleGod loves you The Immorality Act was to prohibit sexual contact between these two groups.

Which was a line in a letter he wrote to his mother on death row. I wanna be Drug lord @Jack Sparrow De Klerk is still alive. Boipatong incident. We were not born yesterday.
