58:07,59:43, "part and parcel of this lady no a genuine error "Was there not a Pamensky Kevin I heard you from the beginning I AGREE with anything she says or does Rob yes there was that this pamensky preferred shebbeens to cricket He is not involved in corruption he is their as a Witness to expose what went on she is really learned with sober ethics beautiful women don't make mistakes but they married wrong husbands 
1:00:04,1:02:38, @Rob Nel yes it was his father. she us simply the best only one thing wrong and that's there is not more like her @Gareth Davies thanks very true she is uniquely different she is humbly making her moves but watch her after lunch there is something up her sleeves on areoplanes on his way to the shebeen I recall the paper delivered to my postbox what is a she been

1:06:14,1:08:06, Eliot Chauke ​Leave Mr Molefe alone Why Eliot? Wait and see.. you are making wrong assumptions. This is not a hostile witness are they talking about the million Rand breakfast poor Brian he was fired for having a week of shebeen experience a d punished to the role of member of parliament mikey llikesit yes but looks like something is coming his way Y Elliot?? he is a crook he said T and A... cool sit and talk & talk & talk 
1:08:11,1:10:25, and poor Brian was punished with a 10 million rand shebeen handshake he is nevours and he spent the entire amount in three months Brian the Cry-baby dude seems kinda cool to me No nerves nonsense Shane Brian was destroyed that he was being accused of being a Gupta stooge what did the runner do let's concentrate on the above and nothing else 
1:10:35,1:11:49, YES! True that looks like son is too hot this morning was the track guy at the breakfast Molefes sin was that he stole from the tax payer TRUE This witness is a Non Executive Board member not an Eskom employee. SKELEM GEMMER Vincent you are on the wrong path. dear. 
1:12:03,1:13:46, @Eliot Chauke BS - Molefe is a crook. He did the same at Transnet. skelem? "Google this Pamensky guy its transparent. when there is a spiderweb all top positions look like spiders. note the element of race that do corruption. hard to talk about really born free i was saying molefe is a crook @Mikey Likesit Skelem = dishonest person This witness did not have a top position.. just a board member answer sir Dude why did you come here

Where are they now??????????????? it's almost 530 it's almost 530 am I know for a FACT that Pamenskey has a multi million rand art collection hanging on the walls of Blue Label Telecoms offices in Sandton....wonder how he accumulated this ? the ANC way...corruption and bribes would you ask Mark Zuckerberg the same question? people can be rich its not a crime google edudecstar IS he in the ANC 
1:20:22,1:32:38, He's a hostile witness and looks like a startled rat caught in the glare of a spotlight. You join the dots.... did Zuckerberg sit on the board of a GUPTA company? Zuckerberg can buy eskom out of his backpocket lol weired... so timeline does not matter. the guptas at one point could have been your boss and you did not know it "go Kate @Saresa Myburgh .... you are so right about this woman.... she is magical Zondo must be firm on this man I like her when she is about to sum up she throws curve balls left right center "absolutely. she did her masters in philosophy
