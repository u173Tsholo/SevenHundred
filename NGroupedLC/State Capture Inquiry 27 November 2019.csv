1:34:34,1:39:29, tx Money is the food of the wicked gay @redriger ...I see you left out the Pastors from your list... tooo many of them friend. @redriger so they are lying about the qualifications they obtained? Sickening @Brendan Rampath ...It has now become a jailable offence to lie about qualifications. what are the qualifications of this witness? "@Pastor J well I do not see these people going to jail @redriger I see - so wrong 
1:40:30,1:43:49, @Brendan Rampath ...The wheels have started to turn. Very soon big things will happen. they are busy dealing with figures and yet actual money is not being brought back I hope so because we are sick and tired of people getting away with things just because of the level they are at @Pastor J gathering of evidence must continue Absolutely @Brendan Rampath remember that many security agencies are awaiting the findings of this commission "@redriger yip "Where are these values yeah man show us!! stop hiding... 
1:44:22,1:49:44, 1064 where is it? @redriger how do you think he made the certificates? lol "@redriger possibly I see Breaking news Malema is charged by NPA for discharging firearm in open place and unlawful possession of same fire arm aaaiiiiii man Malema!! yes sad nice redriger yes just came on now @Elvis Malakoane he will definitely get heat for that in Parliament 
1:49:49,1:52:23, "Malema seems to get charged every day "no one is above the laws if so Malema and Zuma compete with court cases "I saw that Zuma actually appeared before this commission last year July Malema must be called to order! He is NOT above the law. So the way these leaders are stealing tax payers' money start to make us think leading is a career that can better our lives quickly. @Brendan Rampath ...He was here 2 months ago @Ricus Ellis I'm with you Thank you at looong last. 
1:52:45,1:57:20, @Pastor J oh wow I need to find those later and watch them. "You didnt miss much Brendan. A few coughs Municipality in Nkandla sent inspectors to to Zuma premises apparently there is invistigations about building "hahaha Pastor I have been meaning to read through Thuli Madonsela's report on Nkandla Show his data please. The chairman is so quiet. I hope he's still following what's on the slides. @SABC Digital News please focus camera on data pamela sue he can't make head or tale of this 
1:57:52,2:05:22, @Pamela Sue maybe he is waiting for lunch @redriger and I thought that service delivery would be better in the Western Cape 😂😂😂 sad reality... transnet @Bianca Arnold yes Transnet "so sad to see all our state companies in such disrepute: prasa Is Danie Nilsen around here? chair looks like he is attending a wrong funeral 
2:06:23,2:14:59, 😂 shame. Spreadsheets are not he's favorite. yes yeah he is not usually so quiet lol Chair has been struggling with audio alot today it's a strategy @Elvis Malakoane ya to avoid giving info EFF the same it is about everyday. the comrats that sold out RSA for kfc Does EFF has student command I thought CIC said he doesn't want it STOP BEING POLITICAL GUYS 
2:15:39,2:22:18, Mbuso Ndlovu OK I withdraw CIC for VBS money Mbuso Ndlovu OK I withdraw @Elvis Malakoane ...You are right bro. He did say that. pastor j How tolerant is that for a person produced by youth league @redriger ...What control? The police are selling guns for R200 each and R20 per bullet. No control there friend @Elvis Malakoane ...Tolerance is anongst one of the fundamental traits that Julius doe not possess. so if you fire a bullet in public at the stadium u are called COMMANDER IN CHIEF @Elvis Malakoane ...After the recent revelations it has now changed to C.I.T a.k.a COMMANDER IN THIEF i think 
2:23:03,2:28:09, ohk that suits him ohk that suits him Just a side note...So CIT started the EFF to get everything for free? Does that then infer the EFF works for the ANC as they trained him? for a faction in the ANC "@MSG Rules ....That seems to be the rumour doing the rounds. He was top of the class during his training despite the earlier ""f"" in woodwork." MSG Rules afrikaans has a word termed Soort soek Soort @pastor ha ha yes roumors with some substance @elvis Ja nee hulle doen. 
2:28:36,2:36:04, This witness sounds very knowledgeable and would make a great executive in the future if he does not encounter politics in his work. @MSG Rules ...Sadly for our poor people. The VBS saga does change the status quo somewhat. Does not sound like rumours anymore his behaviour resonates with a certain faction in the ANC of people with less brains and strong hands to steal @pastor very sad the shepherds became the wolves. the only way to get some ort of justice is for the wolves to go to prison Really hope this commission will show the power that it has and that our President acts upon it @MSG Rules ...Its the new norm. Just look around and see our many Pastors have become wolves. It makes it easier to be a political wolf at times. Deeply saddening Christy yes he is But women catch up quickly this lady left the Chair behind True Elvis. 
2:36:34,2:46:33, @pastor Greed is a nasty thing Accent is king I have a theory if the world can have 80% of women to lead counties there will be wisdom and peace "@Elvis Malakoane  redriger it seldom you find women with Ego men have more ego than real observation I am not sure what a you trying to say Gxobilahle what exactly is your point about lifetime and refinement Brian Molefe is still a colonel. no he is not any more 
2:49:53,2:54:33, there is another Adv lady that I like wonder where she is Adv Hofmeyer This lady is the most intelligent of the Zondo lawyers "@redriger ...Now that we know what ETC means I am not going to respond to your confrontational gobbledegook KEY FOR CORRUPTION sorry @Pastor J @Brendan Rampath ...Brilliant....lets find a few more "sorry i missed that @Stronger together when Honourable Ramaphosa stops ''dreaming'' about it in other news..juju charged for discharging firearm - npa 
2:55:24,2:59:07, exchange-traded commodity @Pastor J another one: Kickbacks for Contracts (tenders) "Emmanuel @Brendan Rampath ...Are you trying to impress me with your 5 Degrees bro. Well you succeeded. Brilliant again. @musawenkosi musa ....hehehehehehehe @Pastor J hahaha no I only have one Deg. sir hahaha lol But malema is always using a firearm... his mouth lol - always firing shots. @Brendan Rampath ...But they cannot charge him for that. It is always blanks...hahahaha
