"I want to see Zuma jabu's must come to the commission qwith a suite case with all the money "the engineer hope EFF watching this @Yumna Thomas Hope Malema is next for prosecution and extreme racism. 
56:03,59:49, "haibo then Jacob comes with his 5 or 6 suitcases "@Stronger together Nothing new Malema and Eff fighting atleast unlike others just there to breath.. its becoz of EFF that zuma is a lost soul I think MO Shaik will help find the 98% @Yumna Thomas Fighting for what? they already looted VBS. They are fighting to loot more. @Yumna Thomas It's because of DA/FF+ ect that Zuma is in his current situation. ANC/EFF protect him. after zuma destroyed S.A... pathetic @Yumna Thomas EFF will be worse than Zuma if they are ever in control. Ramapoes=Zuma's right hand man 
59:49,1:03:22, I see you dont watch your own country Parliment shame "@Yumna Thomas I can see you don't look at their alliances. EFF is still part of the ANC give people credit it's not easy to fight these structures @Stronger together A few weeks ago i saw interviews like that about South Africa as well. South Africa will be worse than Zim. "@Yumna Thomas Yes it is @Yumna Thomas Afriforum literally has to pressure the NPA just to do their job. @Stronger together The rest of the world knows what's going on in South Africa but turns a blind eye. You can't fool all the people all the time. Kenny u sound like you read the opposite of what is written or told in our daily news 
1:04:22,1:07:49, @Endinako Projects Do you believe what you read or hear from our Corrupted news sources of South Africa? proof is within the courts. Time to jail the looters and EFF VBS looters. @Edinako so true "@Stronger together I know about him @Stronger together Pan Africanism is even within our politics in written word now lol. can we start chair? two centers of power only in africa @Stronger together Pan Africanism = Black Supremacy Start already. 
1:09:06,1:11:15, Who is she representing? @Wilson... only one centre of power . Luthuli House. The rest is window dressing @Yumna Thomas it's well documented. Xhosa and Zulu's killed our Indigenous Khoisan to near extinction. Then they sold their very own people as slaves to the Brits to sell to the U.S "@Stronger together Desmond Tutu said that himself. He said ""Black people lived better during apartheid than they do now in""" Madam...facts are facts... lies are lies..... how do you change the facts??????? this lady seem to not get it it makes no difference when the truth is told...... Oh yes.... I forgot... you tell lies on behalf of your clients to who is this lady representing? 
1:11:22,1:14:08, This lady talks with Emotions not with her Educational Background. yes who is she representing guys she like her voice this lady Mr n Mrs Shabalala accused of corruption at the Treasury Advocate Shezi is arguing a lost application. Wasting commission's time. Testing Zondo's patience.. "@Stronger together it was even in Namibia ...old people have/owned/acquired houses bt after demcracy /Indpndence sudenly prices skyrocketed who she representing now for a graduate to acquire both a proper house and proper car while in a democracy or independent is close to imposible "Lies 
1:14:21,1:16:19, @Wilson Hishono Land Issues happen because black people in South Africa reproduce 60 000 Children per year. That's called over population. @Wilson Hishono Especially those in poverty are hit harder after reproduction this lady 3 MINUTES "im glad she is not my lawyer @Kung Fu Kenny well reproducing is fine but equal distirbution of resources is the issue kung fu Kenny you are persistent about black population growth and you are insulting us how is this she is a junior 
1:16:22,1:18:00, "@Wilson Hishono Reproduction isn't ""Fine"". On the scale of 60 000 per year (Statistics from HomeAffairs) it's called OverPopulation. With over population less jobs "But to be honest this lady has got a point If she was my wife I would have killed myself a while back. "she is lecturing the judge on aspects of law and procedure @Elvis Malakoane This is not an insult it's a fact. Growing 60 000 per year for a single race is over population especially in South Africa. Race does not matter we talking about humanity here @Wilson Hishono We're talking about South Africa and the real facts. Over population is the big problem when they have NO JOBS. Application dismissed. Rightly so. Dismissed...after all that long talk 
1:18:02,1:18:43, Thank DJC Dismissed with no reasons Thank you DJC "learned judge mr zondo likes tea What a waste of time but she'll still get paid for her time 30 minute Tea breaks. "@Kung Fu Kenny  Christ. 
1:18:50,1:20:12, "@Immanuel  She is representing Mr. & Mrs. Tshabalala This commission and the tea breaks üò§ dismissed I'm not supriced The commission of adjournments is on a sudden tea break. "@Wilson Hishono No @fuzile dazana HE is consulting i think there is not @Kung Fu Kenny south africa is not overpopulated it is about race and I am not buying a racist undertone of population nonsense it just a cover up to be arrogant 
1:20:13,1:21:51, I wish I can see people like Julius Malema coming into this commission there's a lot we can hear "@Wilson Hishono Go look at any over populated country. Poverty sits with those who create the most children on a yearly basis. When it comes to property go to Nigeria @Kung Fu Kenny youll know what overpopulation is @Wilson Hishono The same thing is going to happen in South Africa in a few years anyways. The rate of black/colored reproduction South Africa is very close to over population. @Sabelo me too There is nothing excessive about South Africa's population growth rate. The problem is a lack of economic growth and infrastructure development to accommodate the growing population. @Stronger together They make more and more children to abuse the Grant System. Kung Fu China has close to 2 Billion people with very few people not working. Those who do not work in China choose to do so. So why should that be a problem in SA @Elvis Malakoane ...Totally agree. It is becoming an unnecassary irritation and has nothing to do with the matter at hand. 
1:22:10,1:25:01, @Ayanda Diliza THANK YOU @Ayanda Diliza It's called over population. Go look at the symptoms of a over populated country. Everything you mentioned falls under Overpopulation. @Ayanda Diliza How can you expect a country to grow when you elect the biggest criminals that loot the country in ANC/EFF? If the country provides the environment for job creation...then there are jobs...easy as that pastor j true pastor and I don't like racist cheap talks because they end up polarising Medical Marijuana can provide BILLIONS of Jobs. They want black people to stay poor and full of hate to use them for political Gain. "As an imminent departure awaits Rh negA @Stronger together That's awesome üëç @Stronger together Not at the moment but i can make a account 
1:25:03,1:29:25, In South Africa population growth are inversely related. During poor economic growth unemployment rises and the poor resort to having more babies to get government grants. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER! "There is a huge problem on the way ... It's called MOTHER NATURE. She always finds a way to ""re-calibrate"" and ""adjust""" No nation has monopoly of knowledge all people have knowledge just others are using their small brains to make rude opinions "For how long is this ""Wharra @Stronger together Have you seen previously expropriated farms are at a rate of 88% Non working and producing nothing. "There will be the mother of all ""super viruses"" one day to bring the balance back to nature...." "So The problem is not the principle of land re-distribution; but its poor and sometimes senseless implementation. 
1:30:08,1:35:06, S.A. like Zim in five years time. Wait and see. Namibia also on the way to.Zim huge corruption going on biggest is Fish Rot saga wish EFF was here to take them down "@Stronger together üëçwill do @Stronger together I can stream 100% fine but download is super slow. I will sign up in the meanwhile for the account most of people think if you have 5 children you chasing the grant of which is not true babies are our future namibia pension fund 600 million lost no one held accountable @Elvis Malakoane maybe the truth hurts. SA will not be over populated in anyway "@Ayanda Diliza They already tried it 
1:35:19,1:38:08, I am not goner get back in this back and forth Whatever keep your boat afloat @johannes mailula Takes nearly 2 Million rand Per child to send them through school to grade 12 alone. People have no Common sense anymore. is there a problem with live streaming on state capture today? Gareth Hellyaer your comment is nonsensical there is no truth in racist talks just egotistical supremacy cheap talk "@Norma Day No thank you Should be back shortly. the problem is we got back the land and we dont have money to buy equipment so what is the purpose for that whites are running the economy like or not @Elvis Malakoane You do realize the current BEE law is racist towards all other races right? 
1:39:06,1:40:51, Kung fu kenny BEE is just a mess because even ordinary black people do not benefit @Elvis Malakoane BEE is a racist law. @Elvis Malakoane You should not earn more because of skin color. Yebo Gogo is back Mabena is back referring to this 70-year old mama - namely me Apologizing zbekwa nje @Elvis Malakoane and that's why Namibia kicked their version of BEE to touch..... BEE does not help the people it is intended to help... "@Stronger together Cough Cough 
1:40:52,1:42:25, I hope this old lady is prepared this time my goodness Zondo doesn't really work well with this evidence leader Here he goes again. He's making a mountain out of nothing because Adv Wentzel is in front of him. Robert Russell true BEE has been highjaked by politicians and cronies I dont think he likes her. "LoL Vuyani Peter @Kung Fu Kenny BEE is not a racist law. Racist laws are made on the principle of exclusion. BEE laws are based on the principle of inclusion of the previously excluded. This lady annoys me a little BEE should be called BFF - best friends forever 
1:42:32,1:46:05, @Stronger together Our current problem is corruption and looting. The family members of politicians and friends. Have you seen Eskom has 60% more people working there than they need? @Ayanda Diliza BEE is a racist Law. It's racist towards any other race. She also annoys Zondo üòÇ @Kung Fu Kenny - agree This advocate makes me not want to watch this. where are the others "@Stronger together nearly 2 Million per year for each of those extra's @Jacqui Baumgardt üëç "@Stronger together Telegram is downloading weeeeh it this lady again long day.. 
1:46:06,1:48:05, Ayanda you are very right about BEE reasoning but how did corruption benefit foreign Indian guys and Bosasa "David Teur not this women again.... maybe she learnt something last week about being more organised Tell me about it Karen x Ayanda you are very right about BEE reasoning but how did corruption benefit foreign Indian guys and Bosasa Pamela Sue- No he has not. @Elvis Malakoane BEE is the reason SOE's are failing. Including Eskom and SAA. advocate Wentzel is very disorganised 
1:48:08,1:49:34, Business execs must run SOEs not cadres "Maxwell Sibiya Wentzel is now very nervous We can twist words n call them anything is long ANC is in power we are going down with slow motion to where Zimbabwe is I feel sorry for her can't be easy @Makwa Choma Slow Motion? Inflation is at 7.5 and our GDP growth at 3.0. South Africa is going down fast. The Rand in 2020 is the worst performing currency thanks to looting and corruption. Engineer with a business degree 
1:50:02,1:51:50, Kung Fu what is the solution?? chapest currency on the market at the mo Thanks to the USELESS ANC @Jacqui Baumgardt Our currency will be very weak one of these days. Below all the other third world countries. Our inflation is worse than many third world countries right now sorry - finger problems! Eish! Our priority is to get rid of ANC quickly than ever @Makwa Choma Restructuring in all areas. Remove BEE policy and hire people based on Experience and Qualifications. Raise the standard passing rate back to 50%.We need educated people working. 0 "Elvis Malakoane 
1:52:07,1:55:41, KUNG FU wrong?? @Stronger together I agree. They loot instead of spending it on their own people for housing and food/plumbing. They do this in many other countries when they want to eliminate a Ethnicity. "@Makwa Choma ok "@Makwa Choma We will never be able to remove them Why we cant remove this thieves tell me why?? "@Stronger together Well "Jou vabond "Jou vabond "Jou vabond

1:56:45,1:59:38, @Kung Fu Kenny - I'll have a cappucino Thanks @Robert Russell Africa My believe is that both blacks n white must unite n forget about the race n colour politics "The ANC is destroying itself from within @jacqui I'm just making a point of how irritating it is when people post about things that don't relate to broadcast subject. Makwa choma fully agree with you when supporters of two clubs fight about the match players sit and drink beer together and laugh at supporters Hey it is my birthday today..

Cargo please explain your comment "There is nothing worse than a rotten cop @Pastor J do you think by continuing with ANC there is a bright future for this country? For instance the president of Rwanda is doing a great job growing the country but he could be eating some of the country's wealth without anyone noticing For instance the president of Rwanda is doing a great job growing the country but he could be eating some of the country's wealth without anyone noticing @Thulani Bukani ...Thats a poignant question. My personal view from experience is that the ANC is a brilliant organisation but unfortunately got populated by all the skelms. Pastor your very wrong all liberation moverment went the same way as ANC @Pastor J ... there's nothing brilliant about ANC... or maybe if u say brilliant in wrongdoing then i will agree with u. 
2:35:46,2:40:37, "Ok @Pastor J now we know that ANC is populated by skelms "Pastor J @Thulani Bukani ....We have reached that point 90% Not 90% but 100% even Ramaphose n DD Mabuza is worse @Eliot Chauke .....The ANC when it was established and therafterwas lead by brilliant leaders.
