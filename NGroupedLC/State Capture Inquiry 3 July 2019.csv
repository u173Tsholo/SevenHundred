-3:38,1:56, The chairman is going to ask most of the questions sabc please we don't want system glitches from the 15 upward @L.P. then they should have selected someone else for Ben Martin's to wipe the smug arrogance but clearly something did not add up are they late in starting or is this sabc glitch? sabc at it again i think is the SABC problem Morning Thank you SABC Digital for failing us once again. Proof of why you're going down. u see it is SABC problem we didn't even the name of the woman

16:08,21:44, SA have 11 official Language it will be a problem to us as NATION to use Mother Tongue @SABC Digital News please fix sound. the sound is not balanced correctly "Our Govt officials mess up Tony Gupta told former transport minister Ben MArtin that the Guptas are president Zuma's guests and friends concerning the wedding plane so zuma knew NO AUDIO? Somebody sounds very sick there "If anyone seriously & honestly look at the manner we think & do things in general don't these take a listen to the audio they are transmitting ü§î I'm with you @Ibo 
22:03,25:47, You cant justify these things in our native languages "As a white man but you can argue nonsense in court and still win "@Nelson Musoliwa I think former Minister Ramathlodi best summed up Zuma's conduct:""He had peddled his executive authority to the Guptas (and also any takers)like a street girl peddles her backside" @Ibo Thabo speaking a different language from yours wont make you dishonest or affect your reasoning capacity why? "so they have similar hairstyle Ja Mr Zwane the Guptas got hold over Zuma "@nelson musoliwa yes Zuma know about that 
25:48,31:05, @carnoth ngomane can you differentiate between speaking a language and living on an adopted language. I am not saying if you speak in a foreigner language you must be a liar goeiemorge heb ik wat gemist? To me the best testimony was that of Ngoako Ramathlodi so far @Thando Nkutha it will make your wording laughable as we are currently experience all over Probable he knew they will land at Waterklof or he gave permission thereof or they used his proxy to land there see smile ? is she fibbing Agree @Thando Nkutha "I am just tuning in now See? coughing now... signs of a liar! 
31:07,32:46, Shame this witness is not feeling well is malema a vbs looter? Keith you could more sympathetic bra "this commission wil tak years @Nelson Musoliwa Zuma (the #1) knew everything but like all crooks he was playing smoke and mirrors and the ANC obliged by blaming such on a lowly Ambassador Koloane (he would later be rewarded) @Siyamcela Nxathi Maybe i should Siya @Thando Nkutha LOL Thief #1 "None wise nation in history ever lives in a foreigner language and no nation ever developed via using a foreigner languages 
33:21,34:41, "Watson how aboit united states? @Thando Nkutha We aint trust no one hey @Ibo Thabo I hear you. How do you propose we resolve that issue? this is a waste of our money "if they wer serious its a joke Number always on the run wat r they waiting for that they havnt already heard? 
35:15,36:37, all the guys who went to Dubai on guptas account r walking free with there millions all the old evidence is being forgotten as ter is too much evidence daily @Thando Nkutha a wise person? "@Ibo Thabo you're wrong @Ibo Thabo using a foreign / different language wont make you non-rational "years ago was waterkloof @Jabu if you say it is a waist of money how could you have been in the knowledge of how deep the looting was? "npa bafana getin 320000 for makin the 2nd round. our money 
36:46,38:25, back door bafana "when is the commission on safa "@Thando Nkutha Guess you slept with a wrong side. I will never be allowed to be censored in any public platform buddy. If you're wiser than i am  Ministers were defending the president not telling us the truth "..if one looks at the centered-ness of ""number one"" in the looting of S.Africa "@Thando Nkutha And i tend to laugh she is not ok @Fello Mkhize A STRATCOM president I agree Norman ANC was severely compromised by Zuma's foolishness. 
38:31,39:31, üòÇüòÇüòÇ malema takes money from criminal cigarete cartel. mazzoti not her too @Zeekat like ???? da is getin money somwer too Clasicaly this witness has just demonstrated how Zuma kept being protected by an ANC which today wants us to believe it has a capacity to reform itself. Sadly they are doing the same with Cyril. every1 has d small nyara skeletons If she was a teacher she would have July off Maybe from Trump @Jabu Malinga 
40:11,41:24, Just because JZ didn't have the authority to authorise landing doesn't mean he didn't put pressure on officials. "@Derek Main Be real & honest Agreed @Derek Main see trust nobody.only u can mak it for yourself. this commission is not savior to sa. "Clearly they asked a wrong question to get a wrong answer and when they did corruption is still rife. may be worse than before name 1 tender which has been given without a bride? just 1. u cant @Ibo Thabo Yes - I agree that's important and necessary. But how do we all communicate? Surely we need to choose a common language in order to do that? 
41:36,42:58, "@Ibo Thabo well if you can't think of any Sounds like that @Jabu Malinga. Why didn‚Äôt they interview Number 1? even a tender to supply toilet paper needs a bribe I believe children should be able to read and understand in any language she speaks beautifully number 1 wil com and say he did not no he was number 1. deny deny duck dive. zuma not goin to say anytin on this comision who is this person? "zuma wil com ter. laugh Hahaha@Jabu Malinga 
44:18,46:09, @Ibo Thabo I'm not saying that common language has to be English but it has to be one language we must all learn. Now reporting these fake accounts fail... Yes.. Fail!! "She is confused they wanted to interview zuma even after the ministers have given their statements mos Why they did not ask this Mr Koloane as to whom Nohe was refering to as 1. SABC sound plz sound is very low yall have no sounds either? zuma was too stupid with numbers.that was his crime "when they told him billions 
46:26,48:04, so they stole billons to Dubai and left him and his son with a few million Ben Martin lied to us "guptas are still flyin high around d world "@Thando Nkutha I understand that - I'm sure everyone feels more comfortable speaking in a language they know well. In a way Ben Martin is a liar Zuma only ever counted how many 000000000 going to No1 @Thando Nkutha It's a valuable skill to learn. "@Makhosi Nobhatyi "but it was opposite 
48:27,49:45, Ben Martin lied to the commission @Khaya Nomoyi They would not dare in case the whole thing points at JG Zuma. JGZ was untouchable within a corrupt ANC. He still is & is bringing the movement down with him like the biblical SAMSON "It makes me question such people's cognitive ability to extrapolate  English - Gave or Sold ? This evidence is defying logic by far; Martins was told by gupta that they are Zuma guests so the no 1 reference is not far fetched @Jabu malinga Zuma and his son have billions at Dubai kept by Guptas they even move their money to iran zuma is not a criminal from only now. did we forget shabir shaik? "@Thando Nkutha Such also "@Zeekat The Anglo-Boer here in SA did very well on many 
50:23,55:21, shabir was conficted of bribing zuma yet zuma was not convicted of takin brides!!! hehehehe (zuma laugh) does that make sense?? guptas wil keep nothing. they used d zumas and left them with wat they hav. ter is no new money for them now @Funicanz I was expecting concrete evidence to him when he says Atul those visitors are friends of Zuma but decided to hide information so he clean himself to be Guptas puppets You don‚Äôt become a Freedom Fighter without the hope it makes you very rich @Jabu Malinga You need to understand the ANC to understand the very thing you are puzzled by. You 1stly dealing with a criminal corrupt organization which will always protect the DON who gives favours "I think Dudu MYENI and crew..will negotiate for a minimum sentence when time comes and become a State witness.Mr number one..will have no where to hide then SABC please get the focus right. Appears blurred "no honor between thieves "@Thando Nkutha What do you imply ""sensitive among us""? Did convey some scathing 
55:25,59:33, @Jabu Malinga The favours keep the DON in power and the need for favours supplies the DON with protectors who will lay their lives to be the next recipients of the DON's favours. That is the ANC! "Zuma is still having his Blue light Brigade  "@Thando Nkutha No matter in Nigeria or SA have 2 or million languages "@Thando Nkutha Really can't remember myself saying anything or a remarks that should deemed ""insensitive.""" hehehe..som guys who never met each other fighting on this chat..hahahah..do they even realize...hehehehe (zuma laugh again) "@Pastor JJ The ANC was never ready to govern. They ought to have given up to Mass Democratic Movement once independence was achieved Zuma will twitted today after this witness finish try to confuse people I can see that coming @makhosi nobhatyi. @Pastor JJ It seems the intention was always to share out the spoils (however those came about) amongst the top cadres.

1:02:58,1:10:04, lol sorry for guys for derailing discussing the today‚Äôs inquiry üôèüôèüôè 16 sorry They will be 'woolly' as there were 4 Indian Cabinet ministers on that Jet Airways plane "President J G Zuma did nothing "In S Africa I will not have 11 languages "@Vukani Mngomezulu That begs the question of why officials would quake in their boots when the Guptas told them : ""This is what #1 wants"". They must have known that the Guptas were tight with Zuma." @Norman Zwane Its strange how this investigation was handle in a very weak approach by the investigators themselves.The first thing the Guptas mentioned the name of Zuma in their request. Zuma cracked the whips and spread the üí∞üí∞üí∏ "Kool 
1:10:15,1:12:23, lol they all trying to protect him "@Khaya Nomoyi Until the DA and others climbed on the bandwagon I wish they call Col Henderson after this because Koloane was not lying.He had to take the fall and got promotion for that. he did ask them. remember the evidence of Ramatlodi? What coerced Kolwane and Anderson to facilitate this landing taking into account the fact that Guptas said they are Zuma's guests. Hope Koloane will come Can we have 13 different languages as sub titles üòé I feel that this Witness is STILL blaming Koloana and Anderson... So why did Mkwebeni put the Waterkloof report in file 13? 
1:13:25,1:15:53, "Thuli said she left it to be completed and reported by the current PP but she never did They made Khoalani and Anderson the fall guys Hope so @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU. She‚Äôs my former DG. Koloane and Anderson could not have taken the risk of allowing the landing of this plane unless there were instructions from above. Anderson took them to court "@Thando Nkutha we won‚Äôt fight on my logic; you as human 1st belong to yourself @Magda Seguin I cannot trust that Mkhwebane whatsoever. Have you managed to watch how dodgy she was on any Zupta related question during her interview for this PP post? Must we believe that Kolwane can violet protocol without Zuma backing; absurd; Kolwane can not do it alone They eventually both left Khoalane to become ambassador and Anderson resigned but litugated against her being blamed 
1:15:57,1:19:56, @Sindiswa Moolman Oh wow.... is she one of the top officials we can trust? LOL I can confidently say so @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU @Keith she appears to be partisan to the EFF and Zuma @lbo Tambo I noticed Truth is not in your thinking üí≠ In fact the whole govt of Zuma was invited to this wedding so obviously it knew all about this landing as gupta already indicated that they are Zuma guests who is next Yesterdays witness gave the most interesting testimony on aviation protocol...there was clearly instructions from very high up judging from what he said @Magda Seguin Spot on! Zuma faction and EFF that endorsed and motivated or persuaded the Chair (Makhosi Khoza) and other ANC Adhoc interview panel MPs that shes was a right candidate for the job. "@Robert Russell that is how the ANC operates 
1:20:23,1:23:22, ??üñêÔ∏è what is wrong now @Magda Seguin She was so dodgy and vague on any Zuma/Gupta related question during or when she was interviewed for this post. And Makhosi Khoza was not really convinced....like DA. "@Keith Malema said yesterday in his press conference that Mabuza will soon take over "@Sindiswa Moolman Okay @Thando Nkutha pls stop being negative & consume by bad habit. what I am saying won‚Äôt be wasteful like the trillions R we are currently wasting try indoctrinate our minds with foreigner cultures 1/2 "It hurts to see people not wanting to take ownership of their lives "The PP closed the Estina case where poor people were conned out of their livelihood @Magda Seguin wOW... I didn't watch his presser cause he confuses me. He say this today and the other tomorrow. Hope Malema is not serious concerning this. Our country needs leaders now 
1:24:05,1:29:34, @Magda Seguin She closed it cause Zuptas were going to be the one in trouble... obviously. She is protecting ACE @Magda Seguin https://youtu.be/wtNK6J07v7s Ace does Zumas bidding from Lootfreely House "@Robert Russell since evryone of substance is a crook in the ANC @Robert Russell Ace is pulling the strings I said it before and will say it again that this country is not safe with the ANC being at the helm. @Naledzani Mashau Too true - corrupt to the core.

1:39:52,1:42:22, Chairman telling the witness her report is not worth the paper it is written on.... Zuma will deny he is number one "guys 15th @Kevin my sentiments exact Their religion has Karma as an attribute to what they do as practitioners of said Faith. These Gupta sleeze bags must have missed that class.. Karma WILL come for them if the number one didn't do it the minister didn't do it so who's to look at Misrepresentation of facts was dealt with. They promoted him...... The Guptas had another multi million wedding and another is coming up 
1:42:28,1:45:29, In most Countries around the world refer to their leaders as #1..... going to be difficult for Zuma to defend that "judge zondo is missing is: It's human nature to be influence by some forces particular by someone with authority #1 is heresy This witness has just proven that her investigation was a sham to protect Zuma Agreeing she bulshitted‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Wait for the suppressed PP report. I think she cut through all the bullshit. Head will roll. ATTENTION HERE COME DE JUDGE Dont give her excuses DCJ!!! it was a violation of SA protocol and funds Misrepresented his knowledge... I call it LIES

These people are too indirect in their dealings. Just try to avoid leaving a paper trail. this witness is not talking the truth... we need to extract the truth from the so called facts... Well said DCJ now we know how she bought that big fat jacket. 
1:47:52,1:49:32, In a court of law Adv. Trengrove will bury her "So this report is inaccurate Any advocate would bury her It is simple they were instructed to protect Zuma at all cost to save their jobs; @Anne M True Ha ha DCJ Zondo just told her she is full of sh.. in a nice way! You don't deal with dishonesty of comrades. NEVER This witness is so useless and wasteful I wonder if she volunteered or was summonsed 
1:49:46,1:50:57, R Hunter the chairman said no such thing. @Nelson Musoliwa I am with you Get Anderson and Kolwane. Cut the crap. They breached the security of the country jail time for them. sell SA to the cheapest buyer. sick She stutters way too much... trying to find the correct words bla bla. Someone please sue this DG and check her bank accounts fast human garbage "@Sindiswa and @Thando "besides he he he this illegal landing of civilians at our military airport could NOT have happened without anyone senior in government authorizing it. NEVER!! 
1:51:12,1:53:08, @R hunter She's a former DG Typical whitewash. Yet you chose to do a half baked investigation Madam and you not one of them. joking they went to the wedding @Granny Mokwena she knows it but is obfuscating You might as well wipe your nose with that report! What about your behaviour of not doing proper investigation.The report did not even suggest dismissal of people involved.There was no rush of the moment pls. it was a sham of a report 
1:53:20,1:55:26, Yes The pressure was Zuma.Who are you fooling here. "nonsense DG cover up Kolwane was rewarded with being made ambassador in Amsterdam. That was his punishment for misrepresentation. She seems forget that facilitating a friend/s not necessarily mean the facilitator have to get some money. Judge Zonda is upset he 8s very quiet @x. .x reopen Robyn Island and we can all go and visit these crooks as tourists i m waiting for mr msholozi to come This advocate is so soft with this witness. 
1:55:46,1:57:46, We need Ms Hofmeyer In the short time they had to do this report they made it too broad. PP was laser focused. Got to the root. This individual is a pathological lair on this event. She has contradicted her own testimony so many times and it is very transparent she has been schooled in her evidence. I have to honestly thank the moderator or the responsible of this live feed on the fast reaction to remove these annoying ads. Wow indeed @thando report of what now from pp Yes age needs to come bullshit *she 
1:57:56,1:58:54, yes @Ibo Thabo I'll second that @Ibo Thabo anyone can get rid of the spam by clicking on the 3 dots to report it. We can all do it. good people lost there jobs. Guptas had a quest that defecated on a public area at the wedding.. could it be one if their guests or a Zuma minister?? Lock this women up and teach her a lesson. Lying under oath that woman is a puppet of Bra Ace and boti msholozi DCJ Zondo does not beleive her version of the events if you read between the lines of his questions. there is no sound here 
1:59:12,2:00:08, @Dominic Przybylski The only problem is that they use different user names so you have to keep blocking each new one. They all running their responsibility nothing shocking when it comes to money This Zondo is putting word into her mouth Probably covering up for a minister since the Guptas have to pay 50K The DCJ is schooling her in how serious it is @ Clive White yes agree.

2:00:10,2:01:35, "only 2 people took the fall @Born free Easy for them to pay that with our money. @Dominic Przybylski Today only I did it over 200 times.

South Africa had 2 cabinets. One that was based in Cape Town and the other in restaurants. @Dominic Przybylski Oh I see. Not sure. Gupta wedding was a national calendar 
2:02:47,2:04:14, Zuma can answer that question The Cluster and Zuma are responsible for the Airforce base plane landing.

Thanks Zondo... she can't express herself easily

2:34:52,2:35:47, Concourt Chief Justice Moegoeng and bench ruled that only English should be used in court.Recently Zumas lawyers tried for him to testify in Zulu but it was rejected because he can't speak English you call him an Idiot... Niyanya nyi work at airport and can not speak English No wonder SA is in a mess @Sindiswa Moolman Don't you think this guy is just toying around and just wanna exploit his full rights? He sounds like IsiXhosa is his first language kodwa...Haw! He looks very hostile No because he answered in English... doh! This witness is prepared to lies again "I was in the air force "he's right mos 
2:35:47,2:37:08, No translation for brigade? he is just populating trix and people are taking the bait @Thando Nkutha i agree with you This guy is toying around the commission .... he's avoiding something This man can not speak isiZulu properly. Major Ntshisi can speak English. yoo this landing he speaks english this is confusion he is a criminal nje. im sure they gave him a large amount for the landing @Magda Seguin Very hostile... this interpreter issue is just a trick 
2:37:22,2:38:45, @Clive White very interesting this is gona drag "Check his facebook profile This will be an interesting testimony. I assume a lot of ranks are affirmitive action posts. he is trying to hide something he can't be the mejar and he can not speak English Who screened the interpreter? Wheeeeeeh!!!!!! ü§î But you have to submit in Zulu "@Thando Nkutha 
2:38:49,2:40:27, Shifty eyes "how can he be a Major "it it ""yo ship"" that im hearing????" "Delay tactics I would not say hostile but scared. he has info boring @funicanz HAHA...But also the guy's accent and type of isiZulu he speaks sounds like that of a Xhosa speaking person. Let alone the funny voice of the interpreter @Ibo Thabo I don't appreciate the racist undertones. The judge speaks English because SA law states that all judicial processes are to be conducted in English. Not any other reason. "@Magda Seguin please share that ""very interesting"" ruling ü§î" 
2:40:33,2:41:38, I have never @Magda Sequin and the interpreter is not a perfect or near perfect isiZulu. "@goolamv no Zulu speaks like this tjo mara Isicela (request) came in English.... "the interpreter just said the request came all the way from India I was responding to Clive White about studies required in the Airforce DCJ ngenelela ngoku tolika ngathi isasaza ibhola üòÉüòÉüòÇüòÇ 
2:41:44,2:42:53, english is our de jure official language .... "Leading question - should have been ""What was the request for?""" not been nasty but sounds like funigalol used on the mines @Millicent Shozi Said so from the beginning. Something wrong with this iSIzULU Your Worship? mara how come someone hold high position want the interpreter.....haaai maan our tax yoship @Michael Wild lol @ fanakalo @Lex Luger lol 
2:43:00,2:44:21, no Michael Wild @goolamv I agree let's hear what he says :) This Officer sounds like he's bringing some new 'nails' for No.1's coffin.. "YES @Ibo Thabo We've already been through the debate of why we have to have a common language. I'm not going there again. His body language gives him away he understand everything which is being asked of him. This guy is just trying to make things complex i wander they wil allow him to testifying by his language. kikiki eish 
2:44:37,2:46:00, Maj Gen: Bulala Inja; Interperter: Kill the dog @Derek Main I guess now it‚Äôs the right time Why does interpreter translate english into english? His English sounds perfect The witness can speak english rather he chose to give evidence in a language of his comfort ANYONE CAN BE A SELLOUT IN THIS SITUATION.. @Ibo Thabo Scroll back in this chat then. I've said what I have to say on that. Sgt Maj to Major in 9 years FFS the translator can't even say it in English 
2:46:27,2:47:49, @Clive White Maybe he is exceptionally talented. @Clive White A sergeant Major must never become a commissioned officer unless he is so distinguished so much that speaking in English in any forum will be cheese He is right to choose his first language and tell the truth and not be confined to English.The judge knows the language. May Hebana zikhiphani here??? Or s Major TOKEN @Derek Main Translatorüò≠üò≠üò≠ Extra costs for the commission @Dominic Przybylski Clearly he is not. Was he promoted for his Zulu proficiency? 
2:48:03,2:49:52, MORS VAN GELD EN TYD He knows English but he is not comfortable testifying on it. which is fair. This guy can clearly understans and process English as he must by necessity process official papers and communicate with others officials in English. Izoxoka le chap üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è "I am happy nonetheless lost in translation.... your warship The interpreter is misrepresenting the witness. Zondo must have known this interpreter to be hopeless Wait translates until he finished sentence? 
2:49:56,2:51:50, SA has 11 official languages and IsiZulu is one of them the witness must speak direct to the mic Is the translator accredited? INTERPRETER is on point mos!! @hoolamv many Afrikaans speakers testified and a lot of them struggled but they spoke Englisj "@Magda Seguin no it not Has this inquiry become a farce? "Amen "2K viewers 
2:52:09,2:54:03, @Thando Nkutha I think you meant isiZuru. WORK FORCE EXPERIENCE DOES NOT REQUIRE YOU TO KNOWW ENGLISH.. Why bite your tongue while you have your own language It means he was promoted 8 times and officer training in 6 years.. @carnoth ngomane Yeah - why lie in English when you can lie in your own language. Interesting to hear the similarities between isiZulu and my birthland language isiXhosa. English almost slipped out there Your worship. how did he commucate with foreigners or staff in general if he couldnt speak english 
2:54:13,2:55:42, @Clive White how do you get to 8..... I get 5???? Your Worship Chairperson This is becoming a comedy duo act. He has every right to talk in his mother tongue "This discussion right here @Thando Nkutha Been through the language debate already today. See above. How high is the commission paper trail now üìíüìíüìí "PROBABLY HE KNOWS ENGLISH HE JUST WANTS TO BE COMFORTABLE "@Derek Main you can lie in any language that you are comfortable on 
2:55:42,2:57:19, break please He understands English but he felt he could do justice in his mother tongueüôÉ judge will ask for that paper. Insistence to speak in your mother tongue does not translate into a conspiracy or sinister plot. unelungelo lokukhuluma ulimi lwakho kokukhululeka eSA @carnoth ngomane Exactly is it an example GO Girl üõ¨ Chair will correct the interpretor if need be 
2:57:27,2:58:47, @BK UNYANISILE UMTU NO MTU UNELUNGELO LAKHE The Chair is Zulu @ thanks Sanele "No problem with him speaking his language of choice Maybe he has an interpreter As English isnthe langauge used worldwide in aviation. @Derek Main theres no need to bite your tongue while you have a language you are comfortable on @Ben Cole for a person with such a high rank he should be fluent in Englush especially working on an international platform He was very happy to steal in English just saying 
2:58:54,2:59:46, "Look at the physical appearance of the general Hope it‚Äôs not sign language üòé @Sthakathi Khumalo OlovaüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ The Chair is umZulu not a Zulu Zuma is also going to testify in isiZulu zondo is acting like he is dealing with his daughter (the advocate) "Major wants to give us a clear picture in his home language!! You guys are intolerant THE INTERPRETER IS SAYING WRONG THINGS DAT ARE SED IN ZULU AIBO This is gonna drag on 
2:59:59,3:00:42, this guy is just frustrating the commission purposely She's better than Buthelezi "Lex Luger Dude It fine if noZuma ekhuluma ngesizulu ulimi lwakhe vele @carnoth ngomane Agreed - I said already that SA law allows for interpreters in legal cases and anyone should feel free to use one. Usually as I have already statedü§óü§óü§óü§óü§óü§ó Where's the original NV?? Speaking in his mother tongue gives him time think about the question. Not a bad strategy. "its a bit disturbing that all the major tv channels do not cover this inquiry in full or to have a channel dedicated to this given its importance 
3:00:47,3:01:45, @Ibo Thabo You've just promoted him. @Derek Main well said @Sipho Hlophe is it perhaps not a case of dialect? judge getting upset Lols.. Kodwa ke kukabilihehe @Derek Main not only him but them and i will always do "Magda Seguin Two fold haha yhoo usile lobhuti

3:03:53,3:04:55, Ikhasi ngagcina nini lamaGama isiZulu Ian nice yazi!!! """That was what I was referring too"" I rest my case" There is no seat for the interpreter in a mirage fighet plane amaqhezu He should get a swift Demotion soon Thanks chair. It is KFC for me now Nice opportunity to learn isizulu. Practice by trying to understand what is said before the interpreter say his piece. And he also does numbers in English.....way better than Zuma üòÉ I wi=onder when he learnt to fly 
3:05:14,3:06:42, Zuma is a numbers guy Desk Jockey no ways I'm flying with that brother at the wheel! HELLO Guys! is it over? Is it Adjourned till tomorrow? "Lunch break the interpreter should be replaced with a competent person @Derek Main Now you trying to twist my words but must warn you that I am the very wrong person to be play with. I am promoting every African to be taught & let only speak his or her mother tongue.
