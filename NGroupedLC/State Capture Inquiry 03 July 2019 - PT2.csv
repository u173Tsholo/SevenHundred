56:48,59:17, This interpreter is killing the flow of evidence and the adv is not systematic how is she leading this evidence.Can see she is holding the documents now. spider that was my point "This witness is the scapegoat as ne was a Sgt Maj and would take and execute any order from a higher rank. Even if he disagreed and in exchange he was swiftly promoted to the rank of Major was he deployed to the job? @Zolani Hoza apologies - IsiZulu accepted .. It is not about the language Zondo has just asked the crucial question This is critical response whose this guy 
59:31,1:00:41, The interpreter is irritating die moer in. He could not make the decision as he was new in post and would have been guided by the witness @Rina Erasmus HE IS just being a CU*T Interpreter 🤔 he’s sometimes doing a direct translation No doubt this guy is in Zuma train ".. but that Col just got there I won't be surprised if Zuma sits there and testifies in Zulu come the the 15th 😂😂 how he became a senior while he can't read English or speak looool .. interpreter guys .. 
1:00:44,1:03:17, hey Just live the guy alone😏 maybe its a dialect from Namibia😅 "Exactly .. hiding behing the military protocol .. He can give him his opinion mhhhhh! NCO’s are never listened to by higher ranks. when is Zuma making his guest appearance in the gallery? @Clive White what is NCOs?

In the army you comply and complain later unless the order is illegal.The Col said to him the President knows about this thats why he complied as well as the email from Mr koloane. Because they have their own agenda He assisted the Translator LOOOL transcipt is both in zulu and english @Khulubuse Z why should I shut-up BUT NOT YOU?

"Why appoint someone in a senior position if he can't speak English? Did he always used an interpreter when communicating with people from foreign countries by phone "@@Khulubuse Z In that case 
1:09:35,1:11:12, lol Now he doesn't need the interpreter. It does not matter Interpreter is doing the worse .. he is so eager to deny .. @@Khulubuse Z OK - when's the big day? zondo: ndikufumene😂 deny deny deny forgot even the fact that he doesn't understand english ..

"1st of all Hosia Modiga you calling this man a fool by speaking his native language He is lying under oath and he is going to fall hard Can’t they get better translation The man is laying now 
1:19:57,1:21:37, that's not Zondo style to allow it Hostile witness. now he will be caught.. LOL Crooky eyes! now he is looking shocked "books? rumors? lol give us a ""Pule response""" That is why he is so evasive and closed with evidences; promoted SPUTUPUTU 
1:21:42,1:22:05, it now make sense. Sbhudu bhudu kanjan? Zonda is getting upset its getting hot now I really like the interpreter finally chair. tell him in Zulu Two ranks inbetween. a moderator! .. please do CJ

1:22:44,1:24:04, please ask him how he went from non commission officer to officer Quick. Quick... Nyasimi Geoffrey Looos... its means flimsy way she's not hitting him with the question. no confidence in her voice 3 ranks from warant officer 1 Thank you Khumalo HAHAHHAAHA state capture or pure hatred for former President Zuma? state capture... next "@Nyasimi Geoffrey like abruptly  
1:24:05,1:25:26, "Zondo One big eish - he has no idea what Myburgh actually says about him @Prudence Mokoena Mokoena Do you think is okay to Hate a corrupt man Does he not understand even that ? 🤐 page numbers even need to translated ? Ulahlele amaehlo khona lols... Interpreter why kodw!! Zondo is not entertaining the book hehe perhaps the sections of the book need to be translated for him Thank you KEith am watching from Egypt lobaba kodwa 
1:25:34,1:26:39, Myburg must give eveidence mxm Agreed Call Myburg right to the pointn He must still explain how he became a Major so quickly. dCJ not entertaining hearsay point This book is now hear say yhoo lobaba lo Seems like he was promoted for his role in this debacle. 
1:26:41,1:28:29, Moahi Hlapolos The3 eveidence provided has not been tested on the book hehe 😂 Ndiza mshini lols... iBhanoyi 😂😂😂😂 Judge Zonda is correct. if the author is not there to state where he got his evidence then it cant be used. but does not mean it is nit true or correct. This man is a trustworthy person to defend president I still have issues with the quality of the investigation hostile witness😂 some people like to take us as fools..am sure there are some fools who rushed to go buy the book just to read hearsays and enrich an individual in the process..i will never do that.. 
1:29:11,1:32:01, dart this thing between his eyes ! The book has no legal basis for inferences!! Pure hogwash some say 😛 I don't blame books.. ppl will not turn to write books if the state would actually prosecute somebody This chap is lying The book just opens your eyes. if.it was not true why is there not 100s of cases of the author been sued. makes you think Why was the book brought to the commission Many of the things Myburgh wrote about we already had a fair idea they were happening. it was a reference only on rumours Prevarication always means lies 
1:32:11,1:33:28, .. because .. Henis the first "...He is obligated to Military Code of Law and Conduct this interpreter hai The Major can sue the author if it is fails judge is going to catch him The author is also not prepared to appear before the commission he should have just stayed as a warrant officer "He is the first witness to the commission 
1:33:33,1:35:40, 🤔🤔🤔 And for that he was swiftly promoted through the ranks. The poor Judge he listens 2 times. once in aMaZulu then English and it probably changes in between me too - I was following orders when I raided the bank the other day - where's my promotion to billionaire? .. he coming to the bottleneck .. they almost have him🤔 He is the scape goat Yep - the fall guy But why this witness not explained how he got promoted from the position he had to the one he got after that plane incident? I think he was asked but just ignored or played. 
1:35:53,1:37:56, 100% they must ask him about his promotion @Ibo Thabo Yes - exactly. He hasn't answered that question. yes Zondo wants him to name the person who pressured him uthe usangoma wakhe akhulume isizulu lobhuti "DCJ becoming serious now 😂 .. because .. 
1:37:57,1:39:40, He deliberately ignored or played with the question and I am sure he knew about the book. bu why he is here is about the landing of the gupta plane not about his position..so zondo is right to brush aside the book @Felix Muyoba The question still remains regardless of the book. He is now in a cage😨 "...He must follow Orders from a Superior Officer like a hare caught in the headlights @Felix Muyoba but there have to be follow up on what he is here for Phaaa "On one side he has Zondo and on the other side his masters 
1:39:46,1:41:25, Being caught Tjoooooooo!!! gotten "agree Counselor is out not even getting involved question 🤷🏾‍♀️ she must go Hoffmeyor take over .... the judge is onto him. SUCH AN IRRITATING WITNESS ! Major is burning... Why you give the number if you are not satisfied? 
1:41:27,1:42:18, akajiki lomuntu He could be disciplined when he gets back to Waterkloof ...Here is the Interjection of Authority(President). lol don't play with Zondo That is the question Reply bra chickens are coming home to roast. "name 😀 
1:42:23,1:43:22, Tjooo whos that person Enter Deputy Chief Justice Zondo!!! this guy😫 The judge does not play.try somewhere major Interpreter please shut up "No Yes yes yes ZONDO lomuntu udlala ngathi uyasazi isilungu 
1:43:35,1:44:38, These juniors are giving Zondo tough time as he has to ask questions himself to get clarity. Bust Boetjie....bust ...At this point the Officer is being persecuted for an obligation to Military Codes of Conduct. he should have followed the protocol. Following orders... So you can ignore military structures in favour of DIRCO always do the right thing! Zondo is being disingenuous he wants a name... Should court marshall this guy. Took orders from DIRCO 
1:44:46,1:45:52, The army does not take orders from Kholoane "@Nyasimi Geoffrey Wow...from up North This OKE is he worst soldier in the world - he ignores the rank and file - and listens to outsiders Now that im a major i can push back lolzer Giving the Col Van Zyl the blame if they say kill people so you have to follow the command even if you know its wrong woow i give up We about to hear what happened.. Court Marshall him! that is why he was given promotions. 
1:46:01,1:47:21, ".. shame van zyl What happened at the NURENBURG trials t the Germans after WWII This guy must be fired "@fikile mbokodi that's exactly what soldiers do Van zyl will be testifying? we are going through a maze with this one So the senior cleaner at the department of trash can have a plane land in South Africa - just contact Zulu boy and he will organize in zulu Van Zyl was told after the fact if I understood correctly Lessons of the Nuremberg trial have been forgotten. Everybody is responsible for their own action. Following orders is not an excuse. 
1:47:23,1:48:31, @Tsepang Ranneileng But they shoyldn't follow orders from someone outside the military. wooow so that means when you are a soldieer you dont have your own brain "agree @Derek Main ....spot on Some people here clearly have never been in the military.. Tou break protocol on Zuma side you get promotion for you have taken it that you protect him "this bloke understands english Ask the Audience? 50:50?Phone a Friend? Did he blame colonialism? 
1:48:33,1:49:38, In any force anywhere in the world @Derek Main that someone outside the military was himself taking orders from the commander in chief AKA number 1😂😂 money changes police orders That was a lie @Tsepang Ranneileng Now you are getting closer to the truth of it. Nobody wants to say it though. so he is just an EMPTY BOX up there ? He was never forced - send me an email - I will send you some airplanes and a batajon hahahaha The guy rehearsed this evidence 
1:49:51,1:50:42, "@Derek Main they've been saying it @Khulubuse Z Pay your workers what they're due. SANDF officer material. is he reading? This gentle 'check collector' thinks he will be off the hook. Everyone in the value chain has a role to play. He is stupid and still covering up for whoever. I don't believe this Is anyone whom higher than you at soldiers when you are not satisfied? Eeeeeesh...this major is sure covering up......another Jacobo fall guy... lol ".. but what other sense can one make from this poor witness 
1:50:43,1:51:41, He is speaking in tongues "He did to a point ayeye poor processes A Crystal Ball will give us more satisfying answers ! @Khulubuse Z You must go to jail for your crimes. You're part of the state capture rot. The magic 8-ball will give better answers The power of number 1 great 😂😂😂😂 "...@viva padre pio the interpreter ke moleko straight 
1:51:47,1:53:36, Yes....Uncle Donad's marines are coming.......... "corruption can make you not to decide on your own "@Clive White inevitably Is somebody watching the sub-titles on this - it is hilerious Probably by military court @makiwa very correct. Interpreter sounds like Leon Shuster So after all this - did you do it ? Claster... 
1:53:37,1:54:59, Give the interpreter some Bells "With the previous witness today she said ""they did listen some telephone conversations"" by people who were discussing the authorisation Yes men get promoted. People with integrity get fired. The flight was not supposed to land. WHY DID IT LAND THERE? how on earth could you get that senior position The chair must understand that there are staff that above yuour pay grade This now implicates the Indian High COmmissioner for being an accessory. @Dominic Przybylski It's the ANC way. The likely he will be called back. 
1:55:20,1:56:27, Unless he is posted away from Waterkloof When is Kolwane going to be on the stand? Now the ambassador wants to place position This week I think Sergeant Major .....heyi kunzima!!! Rule 33 is what? .. tshini la kaka ifuna ushiyeka .. Why people are laughing on the background? LOL hahahaha he is proper bullet proof vested with his laywer entourage 
1:56:37,1:57:39, @Zolani Hoza Hahahahaha So in SANDF all documents are in vernacular since a whole Major can't articulate himself in business language.Or is this a strategy.Great to hear only if the interpreter could do him justice. @Ibo Thabo Infroming people they will be implicated by witnesses testimony. tactic Anyone higher than you sir can do something you are not happy to do will you just do it because they say do it 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ @Ibo Thabo Rule 33 is notification to a person where evidence by a witness may implicate him. that's tactically bring him .. kwenzenjani 
1:57:44,1:58:37, and this guy was promoted How many generals do we have in SANDF? . m. ow noooooo tomorrow???? will adjurn .. Dominic Przybylski - enough to change a light bulb it was enough with this now witness 
1:58:46,2:00:00, Heh? @Derek Main thanks and that white boy is a lawyer for who? @Dominic Przybylski Checkers ya all Zondo is exhausted @Ibo Thabo For Kolwane "Ha-ha @Moahi Hlapolos He's not happy at all ok thank you all Lol
