I noticed him even with Adv Notshe Who is this evidence leader? @Salone seabi they'll have hidden smallanyana skeletons i don't knw his name the guptas brought eskom to its knees. only 1 family Evidence leader looks like the late Steve Tshwete yaaa The guptas had lots of help loool 
28:56,30:33, @Xolani Nhleko he skips critical details. Minister not mentioned by name and neither the then president of the country. """ WE SHALL LEARN HOW OPTIMUM COAL WAS SUFFOCATED IN FAVOUR OF TEGETA.""" "Let's give the Advocate time  I am missing Kate dealing with swissport Ndzeku eh...eh zuma will be implicated heavily 2day liar "Kate "I don't know 
30:46,33:45, @ sandra yep. the Gupta family and political figures. I agree. Notshe also looked wobbly in the beginning but rose to be a star. Seleke is just acclamatizing agree Mr Notshe was resilient on Friday 👏👏👏👏 "@Salome Seabi Well not quite it took a corrupt lieing president and the entire African National Corruption party yaaaa I read article written by Khaya Sithole regarding bizarre testimony by Ndzeku it's a jaw dropper lool "zuma was behind all forms of corruption in the country 
34:21,36:08, "@Angelo Doubel at first I was worried that he would not be up to the task zuma is a billiornar in usd i wonder if he still has that money @Angelo Doubel Yep and I hope Pule brings the same! Ben Ngubane...... there's it the usual suspects.. "Zuma was not behind all corruption in SA exactly @ sophie demmings what an unfortunate name... Mr Tsotsi🙈🙈 
36:10,38:09, "our problem is not Zuma Ke Tsotsi That reminds me-greetings to all the thieves and liars watching at Lootfreely house and once again thanks for the rolling black outs they are NOT appreciatedPS where do u guys park your Austin Martins This Board removed CEO Matona because he was going to be an instruction 🤣😂🤷 gupta extradition must be expedited as a matter of nation emergency. they must return the money asap @linda 😂😂😂😂 of of of of This man out here barking like a stray dog "Even Cyril will not get rid of corruption 
38:16,40:23, full of anger "The only way this country is ever going to prosper is when the ANC government has been removed. Otherwise Gigaba must be called again because is highly implicated. @Sophie Demmings as per usual 😊 Was Gigaba the Minister? Tebogo Sibilanga I agree with you "zuma has hurt lot of ppl ANC replaced by who? "@Wesley stop confusing me. Where do individuals start and end 
40:43,42:14, replaced by anything available my vote is going to Herman Mashaba @ Salome Seabi ​ sadly so. at least he not anc My vote is getting closer and closer to Herman Mashaba... """she"" the minister the ANC as an organisation is corrupt. We have poor quality opposition parties which do not really give the ANC any sleepless nights. And the mushrooming of new political parties is not helping either. Zuma was the beginning of the ANCs corruption 
42:33,43:59, The Prez should have acted earlier on fraud to maintain credibility. He has however treated the whole State capture like a fart and hoped it would go away. Alas . .it will hang around for a long time I totally agree @tgebogo Divide and rule strategy works for the ANC Mashaba is bringing what? Molefe Singh and Koko need to be brought in front of the commission. @Rita Scalone it actually dates post his tym. corruption was there even during mandelass tym. we hv enquiries for this that took place in the late 1989 "@Tebogo Sibilangam Sadly its to late @Tebogo Sibilanga So right... too weak 
44:00,45:32, waste if money. Koko and gang must go straight to court. if all the guilty parties were to be called before the Zondo commission it would cost us tax payers a fortune as it would never end "Molefe what worries most people is when this corrupt people will bring the money back "for the health and safety of South Africa The ANC might have a chance if they could send all of their cabinet to prison and replace them with young Professionals. @ramonyana ..never anc has fail all of us So true Thami Ngwenya by who nyani🤔🤔 
46:02,47:42, "vote for whoever you want if anc can win next elewction the i dont know. no 1 must vote anc plz I personally have no faith in these endless commissions of inquiries. How many were held before? What happened to the implicated? Evidence of corruption are buried in these commissions. "ANC stands for ""Always Notoriously Corrupt"" !!" ZAGA "ANC must clean up zondo and eeeeehhhh anc does not own us nononon what 
47:51,49:13, Andre Ackerman only the word of the Lord shall stand forever!!! cmon plz matona has always been an honest civil are civil servant since i knew him in DTI nobody says the anc own anybody PS5 price please we need to suspend Anc maybe for 2decades for the sake of our grandchildren "@Kariba All departments are excelling with corruption . We should punish ANC and teach them a lesson. Show them as we made them we will also destroy them. Theres NO # TILL JESUS COMES *** As they claim ... Since 200 = 16 Commission of Inquiry. No person is wearing Orange Overalls 
49:14,50:26, PS5 you are in a wrong stream Its useless to have great policies for showcasing when they are not actioned. ANC has failed us all and it will continue to fail to to an even worse degree than Zimbabwe. "the ANC has delivered us from the yoke of apartheid Since 2001 = 16 Commission of Inquiry. No person is wearing Orange Overalls "Unfortunately we still have people who votes the ANC because they ""ended"" apartheid. I don't owe them any favour I'm still gona cast my vote for the anc for the last time if they don't change exactly @theo "PS5 SUCKS "The word of Lord never helped us for about 4 decades. Why should we rely to him. We freed ourselves 
50:47,52:33, No! @xolani why... you giving them the licence to continue with their corruption PS5 > RTX3090 "@ Tebugo that is not true..WNC was effective in the struggle tea time again Yes to Housekeeping 😁😛 We should not let our country to go Zimbabwean way. Not in this South Africa. Zondo loves his JOKO tea the majority of corrupt civil servants are ordinary employees who dont get caught 
52:33,54:25, ANC I meant to say 🙄🙄 Rita this is a free country you can vote whoever you are comfortable with. it's your choice "no its this dream we are sold of conspicuous consumption that poor and ill educated will do anything to atain. Ppl gotta realise you can only drive 1 car at a time and live in 1 house. We are sold greed. this commission is not going to finish in time The fish rots from the head. The whole organisation is paralyzed with corruption thiz commission is only wasting.lot of money Honestly SPEAKING this Commission is on for two years do these new evidence leaders not watch or listen to the proceedings if we listener's know more 
54:27,56:23, yes we can vote whoever we choose ....so let's keep voting for the thieves and don't complain. I complain bos its my tax they stealing My parents and my family suffered under the previous regime and I had to stand up to fight for our Freedom. But I won't let ANC to be captured by clear rascals. @dada ngova : corruption exists globally with a certain limitations. The ANC grabs the whole meal from your table and then continues to force their filthy hands down your throat to extract everything. Well you will learn when you visit your library..put any party in power there will always be bad ones i might be wrong but the commission is very informative yet useless you right yes James made us aware of more looting than we anticipated "@ Kariba I disagree Bring bad the DEATH PENALTY. Hang every ANC fraud star like yesterday... 
57:23,59:31, lol It's going to be bad before it gets better..that's the continent's style yeah i guess so @Thabo you SPEAKING like your entire family is doing well under these thieves "@dada ngova : i am based in Saudi Arabia and anyone found guilty of such crimes i had seen my father full of blood beaten by white bosses of that time and i have seen him rejoice under the first democratic president unfortunately he did not leave long enough to see this katiba...ANC will never do that bcos they will all be in orange uniforms go and vote for your own choice that will free you from your misery. your vote counts yes your vote can visibly bring you misery too 
1:00:53,1:08:21, "@ Kariba the King's bad boy jumps into other countries to kill his adversaries @ Kariba lol the only reason there is almost know corruption in Saudi Arabia is because all the thieves are enjoying there money there keep an eye out for the Gupta's I live in a so called first world country and they fight over corruption all the time..no sort of zondo commission to display such cases exactly..the commissions are a form of payment to comrades too? too many commissions no outcomes "This is trial enough and throw them all in jail. seize assets is Zondo going for the Second cup of tea? Can someone plz call him back.. I wonder how many times a day he removes and replaces his mask Tebogo you assertion is very correct ANC thinks that they made us a favour...... Gerhard if it was u or I that's what would have been done 
1:08:51,1:16:32, People come to these commissions and lie under oath knowing very well that nothing`s going to happen to them. Why then would one have faith in this very expensive circus? the ones who will continue to vote for the Anc have faith in them unfortunately Just jail the lot and save the taxpayer a lot of money. Thanks to JZ and his crew and the trillions stolen blatantly everyone involved needs a new Orange Jumpsuit care of the South African Public . "The president cant waste taxes payers money Jacob Zuma and his friends sold our country to the highest BIDDER and they dont care as a long as their families thrive @ the expense of the country. this is unfair Destroy the anc and eff! Be gone anc! Be gone eff! H A L O two useless organisations 
1:17:26,1:26:48, Which one`s are useful Lebza? @Lebohang Mofokeng share the proof of how J ZUMA sold the country Tebza none ....this country is doomed Musa he acted dumb to the Guptas bra. @musa to the Guptas Musa what do you think ....why were we worse during his tenure???? his choice of civil servants in the strategic SA public sector companies. The aim was to destroy this country musa stop defending zuma he sold our country finish and klaar bra oh Musa how naive you are...such a pity. how much more proof do you want Petrol bombing by racist EFF ....JULIUS Malema 
1:26:52,1:32:11, wow Anele Mkwekwe indeed I dont care what Musa he sold us sinjenje due to his wrong choices He sold the country but putting uneducated corrupt people in positions of power who cared for nothing but greed. He was Pres so swindled his thieves in and took big back hands. Head of the snake! jail musa how do you feel when a child drowns in a pit toilet. how do you feel when you see people living in 3x3 shacks with bricks holding down bin bags to keep out the rain. corruption musa!!!!!! Effective Civil servants were frustrated and repressed to leave their employment people suffered because they did not acceed to corrupt "musa and you still defend the ""snake"" who wanted his day in court but is never available to appear. I smell a rat ..in the ANC talking very cheap" @richard don't you know what clicks has done to us any idea what times is zondo coming back I hope the investigation team performed the lifestyle audits of these ECOs subsequently suspended.! 
1:32:55,1:36:10, those in shacks check where they come from .....just see what house they have there they renting it out Amen sister I would have bought it myself I have dry and fuzzy hair grace you 100% correct they have mansions in the rural areas and live in squalor here for the world to see. Rita Scalone yes indeed that man is a slow learner he is short sighted I mean JZ....he just says things for sake of saying them .. day in court the day is granted/// he wants want to appear. confused Who this ADV OF STATE CAPTURE """ GREAT PURGE OF EXCELLENCE Rita are you white? @Owen Nyilika Pule Selena problem with clicks they are comparing race and they concluded that white race is much better and beautiful than black race....... in new SA i think and feel thats was wrong of them 
1:36:38,1:41:37, @LADY T TAKS @Owen Nyilika 👍🏾 @MULISA NKUNA what you say if the stylist for the shoot or ad co was black? "Clicks already said sorry @CanisAfricanis I agree Greetings cousins... I saw that everyone was talking about clicks so I checked it out for myself... "I was traumatised having no hair "@thomas cleghorn So if I understand correctly they compared a black woman's brittle hair with a white woman's fine hair? 
1:41:59,1:44:19, Mr Selena is such a nice calm Dzaddy 😍😍😍😍😍 @a b c 😬😥🤦🏾‍♀️ :stayhome: If that's the case then that's a bit weird... @Samm Lindy Tshuma 😊 Behave🤭 @Lady T 🤭 "@a b c @Mulisa Nkuna oooh... have they apologized yet? @Samm Lindy Tshuma his voice is soothing though😊.Listen when he is reading😛! 
1:44:20,1:47:52, I commend EEF for this one 👏👏 I agree....stick to the subject at hand....corruption. The EFF is looking for side shows to hide their VBS Looting. Bring them here and get Adv Kate Hofmeyer onto them. "John stop with those dictatorial tendencies of yours @Samm Lindy Tshuma I am even attentively listening😊! "Ntate Zondo...hao o tlhalositse earlier rra why do people like John feel the need to be bossy and issue instructions everywhere they go. they should limit that behaviour only to their homes If Judge Zondo was less pedantic we might actually get somewhere. Sometimes it seems like he's deliberately slowing everything down. Or am I imagining it ? @Mike You're totally not alone on that... I've noticed this too very often... @Mike D Fraser I think most times wants to get clarification which is fair.Today his booklet of evidence is numbered with both red and black instead of the usual black!! 
1:47:59,1:49:14, Law is pedantic guys You are imagining things...at the he will alone compiling the report and coming with recommendations/ he avoids confusion I wish Moseneke was appointed for this tusk Mike he has to make sure the question is very clear for obvious legal reasons Jan van Riebeecks fault with his long flowing curly locks. The CEO of CLICKS *questioning "only stupid people vote ANC. 25 years and still kids are schooled under trees  Bulali you are correct brin back Notshe 
1:49:43,1:50:56, "@erasmus we should have had interim report already lol @Elton Josea you want Tshotsho😊 Give the guy a chance. It’s the first time he is leading evidence at the Commission - pretty much like his first day on the job A suggestion; by its very definition; has NOTHING to do with being dictatorial .... 😇 Lol so he's a greenhorn... he speaks well though "no more reports  "Slowly slowly .....I would be very interested in the number of hours charged for the recurring topic of ""Pagination""?? don't they ever learn?"
