Remember this is my view or opinion. lets agree to disagree Zondo needs a wjisky whiskey "Not at all Double shot on ice thanks Hallo Registrar *wink* 
31:28,33:33, Kenneth that's a reach Hahaha. This is funny. I can hear everything on this whispering "@kenneth mampa I do not disagree with your view that ""he is not fit to chair this commission"" What they were saying Gambu His thinking of CIC Malema.. "ha ha ha you don't wanna mess with that guy white boy especially if you're representing the foreign criminals... Hahaha. Malema is a black racist. But worse is Mngxithama. 
34:14,35:52, mxmtama is a bloody agent. tried to set up EFF members the dog that barks the loudest is the scarest = mampoenpaan malema but the foreign criminals here are the Guptas. true Louis racist means to be for your race criminals must go to jail sample as ABC @Bronx Wavy - thats the stupidesnt thing ive ever heard but I'm black too Brobx.

Can someone help me please. The submission that they presenting here. is that a closing argument? are they still going to call more witness or what? 
39:40,41:09, @Desmond Masilela the establishment doesn't want to allow cross examinations because it will kick up too many names they want to hide thats why we are having an inquiry not an inquest or a trial ya now guptas are tapped at source when you talk of gcis money come from there tna and ann7 to promote their propaganda "Am standing by my truth @Norman Zwane "cross examination of some witnesses not all is a proper move "Nomthetho. ..the BLF must rather stay away from the Zulu  All witnesses should be allowed to be cross examined 
41:45,43:27, Thank you @Steemit OneAzania... lifestyle audit????? does he owe taxes? been bribed? stolen??? shedding tears cannot be equated to being emotional on a commissioners stand I hope Zuma doesn't expect us to pay his legal fees for proceedings during this commission. we waste our data to listen the letter from the criminal which witness What Time is the witness coming "@kenneth mampa Ah well maybe you know the judge that much more than I do. In which case I have no argument. If you do not @Desmond Masilela I think the publisc will support the commissioner denying cross examination - this wouid be unfortunate. The establishment wants us to buy the narrative of blaming foreigners.. Please call me once he‚Äôs there 
43:52,45:06, Who is this man standing? and who is he representing? ^ "@kenneth mampa Whilst you are entitled to your own opinions "@Desmond Masilela It's  guptas he is representing one of the Guptas JJ Tabane last night sad on air that he is willing to come and testify if Faith comes out in her defence against Williams. He even apgsd to miss williams for burning a blind eye when she raised issue Ajay Gupta I thought so... but i'm not sure @Steemit OneAzania 
45:17,48:27, we were raped standing by guptas "mngxitama is racist "@Desmond Masilela a cross examination may call into question the honesty of a witness Is this man from Dubai or SA? his also been Captured by Zupta too@Steemit OneAzania who is taking the stand today @Desmond Masilela I believe he is a lawyer and his submission is calling for the opportunuty tyo cross examine a witness It seems ridiculous that anyone should have to submit an argument for something so obvious This submission will be denied. Itis a means to swep the real story under a rug Nomthetho it's like that...all experiences proof it. Very sad in these times. 
48:48,54:01, I think that will be fare too @Steemit OneAzania . but also they need to call Ajay Gupta and hi brother to come testify and call Jacob Zuma too. dont you think so Steemit? "Iam not worried about guptas come here to sell shoes  I want to hear Faith's version of the truth. Why this guy is still talking may draw a blank here. The accuser's version must be tested. But the implicated must also their version across as well. "guys after this commission of inquiry than their investigation do u think  @Bronx Wavy I doubt if Faith has a version since Pottenger is no more. Let's apply GODs required version ALL OVER THE WORLD. We have been around long enough to change everything to Suite GODs requirements @Desmond Masilela most definitely - A prosecuting authority should bbuild a case against them and prove it in a court. Instead of this silly inquiry 
54:10,56:22, "School him Justice Zondo @Thando Nkutha You so right! Viva Zondo viva news 24 No one will be arrested. @Norman Zwane. What happen at Life Esidimeni. No one was arrested instate they Dr Cedani Mahlangu was elected back to her duty. @Tshepo Mahlangu I respect Justice Zondo... this Gupta representative should not take the whole day trying to protect the crooks like Guptas "Faith has her version of employing family in her dept with out relevant qualifications Is this lawyer South African? he seems to be unfamiliar with the country's justice system. "@Tshepo Mahlangu Yes 
56:30,57:41, zuma must go n rot in jail Who is this guy speaking here? He is from Orania@Tshepo Mahlangu guptas advocate "@Desmond Masilela The judge Moseneke almost pleaded with our NPA to prosecute the Qedanis @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU he needs to go back to the law school.

I personally don''t see where is this inquiry is taking us to. The question i have is that what happen at Life esidimeni where by more that 100 people die under Cedani Mahlangu @kenneth mampa Kwaaaaaaaaaa!!! This is Ajay guptas lawer. He is prescribing the guptas participation. what a load of crap! face the music Ajay you coward im with Ajay gupter here you can ask any question s @Desmond Masilela my brother - we are the same in questioning that "@Tshepo Mahlangu Hahahaha! I guess Zondo is too professional this is a whitewash just like the esidimeni inquiry this is just time waisting 
59:28,1:00:37, There is no justice in South Africa "he is requesting ""The milk of human kindness"" for the guptas! Bwahahaahahahahahahaah" @Steemit OneAzania So you following this whitewash by choice. Why? No one can be captured unless their minds are weak. These guys sold the people out. Simple. Capture is an excuse This Guy is Wasting time Actually this guy should start by telling us when is he returning our land "Hellens sc @Norman Zwane just like you I follow it. Would you like me to stop following it? "@Paul de Bruyn Hahaha. Though 
1:01:05,1:03:20, @Steemit OneAzania Each to their own. I think the only way to get people arrested its only when people can appear in court of Law. That we can say yes people will be arrrested. @Steemit OneAzania "If his submission wins the day yes sellout is the right word not state capture @Desmond Masilela that's correct. The prosecuting authority doesnt want to build a case against their own people you are playing for time malungu...get your Gupta groper in that room man!!! @Thando Nkutha do you want me to go eat curry and be quiet too? üòÉ Then this is a waist of money and time @Steemit OneAzania this inquiry is turning into journalists workshop. 
1:03:52,1:06:36, @Desmond Masilela it is a waste of our time and money - but it serves the establishment very well. so they will spare no costs They need this inquiry so they can argue they ware not pressing charges because there is an inquiry "that white guy he waste our time will we see Faith today? This guy is trying to delay the proceedings of commission of inquiry we want wetness here and bring gupters Thank you @Steemit OneAzania . Do you perhaps know if today will have someone to testify or tomorrow? Tea time "luthuli house

Guys marikana things we butter Ramaphosa who was in charge then in government isn‚Äôt Zuma? Have Zuma ever went to marikana? All CR was saying no more killings after those whom killed by strikers True that @ Ntuthuko "Ajuy Gupta said to Mcebisi - ""you don't want to help the DA but he's using DA laywer"

Very bloody arrogant and it must be stopped. We cannot expect this commission to go and sit in Dubai. Is this a banana republic... how can we ask the implicated to dictate to feeble justice system ? @The Edge Search not really. They used Zuma to control these institutions and now Zuma is no longer a president and they talk lies.

1:52:55,1:54:20, Guptas through the toothless hwks should be extradicted to SA to answer "LAMA GUPTA UYADELALA Is the Judge breathing okay? Its all a joke. wasting time and our money "@Desmond Masilela my brother they know they are 110% guilty. The evidence is too strong "Where is ANC MPs who sad Thuli was working for whites and she is a spy? Zokwane is first J the are fugitives and theives and thugs "if Gupta's they say they done nothing rong in South Africa 
1:54:27,1:55:02, "It very hard to be a lawyer because this man knows very well Guptas are guilty international community to arrest the devils Dead arguement from the fugitives. How did the gupta know hawks npa are incomplete and reckless? Under mine Judge Zodo these Guptas want to be cross examined in Dubai...maybe they have a Saxonwold shebeen there as well "Is it maybe the Constitution which allows them to dictate @bonnie mazzie. They Gupta are disrespecting SA and its Law. want to meet outside SA why... gukty 
1:55:04,1:57:11, @Paul de Bruyn I wish Trump can order arrest against them in international court now. @Tulonga Henoch üòÄ I think the judge needs to go to the gym... How does Duduzane feels about guptas utterances now; reckless incompetence ja ne "Incompetent of police its time to refer them to interpol Guptas undermines our constitution laws.....Incompetent is understatement. im tired of this person yaz why he says the commissiom is not incompleted They must have been informed by the old Sheriff at that particular period that they are incompetent. Guptas are basically using Section 7 (a) of the Euphonik Act of 2016 Msunu yenu Nonke 
1:57:17,1:58:44, Am so disappointed with you South Africa by supporting the Gupta in wat they say about state that is mess so what they are trying to say to the world about us He is also arrogant and must be put in his place by the Deputy Chief lamaGUPTA LAWA HEE "The Guptas knows very well that J Zondo is going to put this guy in order just watch Why Guptas don't hire black lawyers? iam glad that guptas are brutally honest they're scared to be arrested üòÇüòÇüòÇ We Will Arrest them.
