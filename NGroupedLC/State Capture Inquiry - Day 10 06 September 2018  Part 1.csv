Zondo is the very same man who cried during his interview for DJP. his voice is scary @Lorna Kavanagh - u mean bad teeth Maleka? I wasnt rude Kenneth he was telling a personal story of a man that sponsors his education just block @Ganasan from the chat commons doing NPA work for the last 10 years*** 
26:52,28:49, Zondo is a real man I understand but my point is that he is emotional and for him to Chair a commission like this...... commission😳 yes @Zigi The African - he's also a big man . Probably 250 pounds or more Maleka can do better comrades give SAns a bad name jimmy manyi he just want to waste our time he khow its a criminal He doesn't have that thing 
29:05,31:07, Is not this the same lawyer who represented JZ recently? your looking for entertainment. this isn't that @kenneth mampa don't you think it is presuming too much to pre-judge another human being state emotion? Remember this is my view or opinion. lets agree to disagree Zondo needs a wjisky whiskey "Not at all Double shot on ice thanks Hallo Registrar *wink* 
31:28,33:33, Kenneth that's a reach Hahaha. This is funny. I can hear everything on this whispering "@kenneth mampa I do not disagree with your view that ""he is not fit to chair this commission"" What they were saying Gambu His thinking of CIC Malema.. "ha ha ha you don't wanna mess with that guy white boy especially if you're representing the foreign criminals... Hahaha. Malema is a black racist. But worse is Mngxithama. 
34:14,35:52, mxmtama is a bloody agent. tried to set up EFF members the dog that barks the loudest is the scarest = mampoenpaan malema but the foreign criminals here are the Guptas. true Louis racist means to be for your race criminals must go to jail sample as ABC @Bronx Wavy - thats the stupidesnt thing ive ever heard but I'm black too Brobx. "mnxithama still needs to learn more about politics 
35:58,38:28, Bronx did i hear a fart...could be my ears...lol look up etymology gamu. racism was a term for ppl eccentric about their own. turned into hate by wicked countenance people or chairman usual sounds mngxitama wants shares from ingonyama trust Andile is the clawn mxmtama said on tv openly that he wants GUPTA money lol Hello Africans and Americans 😃 what do we say - will this inquiry allow cross examinations or just nice and polite examinations? Can someone help me please. The submission that they presenting here. is that a closing argument? are they still going to call more witness or what? 
39:40,41:09, @Desmond Masilela the establishment doesn't want to allow cross examinations because it will kick up too many names they want to hide thats why we are having an inquiry not an inquest or a trial ya now guptas are tapped at source when you talk of gcis money come from there tna and ann7 to promote their propaganda "Am standing by my truth @Norman Zwane "cross examination of some witnesses not all is a proper move "Nomthetho. ..the BLF must rather stay away from the Zulu  All witnesses should be allowed to be cross examined 
41:45,43:27, Thank you @Steemit OneAzania... lifestyle audit????? does he owe taxes? been bribed? stolen??? shedding tears cannot be equated to being emotional on a commissioners stand I hope Zuma doesn't expect us to pay his legal fees for proceedings during this commission. we waste our data to listen the letter from the criminal which witness What Time is the witness coming "@kenneth mampa Ah well maybe you know the judge that much more than I do. In which case I have no argument. If you do not @Desmond Masilela I think the publisc will support the commissioner denying cross examination - this wouid be unfortunate. The establishment wants us to buy the narrative of blaming foreigners.. Please call me once he’s there 
43:52,45:06, Who is this man standing? and who is he representing? ^ "@kenneth mampa Whilst you are entitled to your own opinions "@Desmond Masilela It's  guptas he is representing one of the Guptas JJ Tabane last night sad on air that he is willing to come and testify if Faith comes out in her defence against Williams. He even apgsd to miss williams for burning a blind eye when she raised issue Ajay Gupta I thought so... but i'm not sure @Steemit OneAzania 
45:17,48:27, we were raped standing by guptas "mngxitama is racist "@Desmond Masilela a cross examination may call into question the honesty of a witness Is this man from Dubai or SA? his also been Captured by Zupta too@Steemit OneAzania who is taking the stand today @Desmond Masilela I believe he is a lawyer and his submission is calling for the opportunuty tyo cross examine a witness It seems ridiculous that anyone should have to submit an argument for something so obvious This submission will be denied. Itis a means to swep the real story under a rug Nomthetho it's like that...all experiences proof it. Very sad in these times. 
48:48,54:01, I think that will be fare too @Steemit OneAzania . but also they need to call Ajay Gupta and hi brother to come testify and call Jacob Zuma too. dont you think so Steemit? "Iam not worried about guptas come here to sell shoes  I want to hear Faith's version of the truth. Why this guy is still talking may draw a blank here. The accuser's version must be tested. But the implicated must also their version across as well. "guys after this commission of inquiry than their investigation do u think  @Bronx Wavy I doubt if Faith has a version since Pottenger is no more. Let's apply GODs required version ALL OVER THE WORLD. We have been around long enough to change everything to Suite GODs requirements @Desmond Masilela most definitely - A prosecuting authority should bbuild a case against them and prove it in a court. Instead of this silly inquiry 
54:10,56:22, "School him Justice Zondo @Thando Nkutha You so right! Viva Zondo viva news 24 No one will be arrested. @Norman Zwane. What happen at Life Esidimeni. No one was arrested instate they Dr Cedani Mahlangu was elected back to her duty. @Tshepo Mahlangu I respect Justice Zondo... this Gupta representative should not take the whole day trying to protect the crooks like Guptas "Faith has her version of employing family in her dept with out relevant qualifications Is this lawyer South African? he seems to be unfamiliar with the country's justice system. "@Tshepo Mahlangu Yes 
56:30,57:41, zuma must go n rot in jail Who is this guy speaking here? He is from Orania@Tshepo Mahlangu guptas advocate "@Desmond Masilela The judge Moseneke almost pleaded with our NPA to prosecute the Qedanis @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU he needs to go back to the law school. Thulani @Thulani Bukani The guy is representing the crooks that stole your taxes 😀😀😀😀😀 orania 
57:53,58:35, "When an expert witness under corss examination is shown to have been coached to give testimony in favor of the state for instance Yes @Steemit OneAzania. I personally don''t see where is this inquiry is taking us to. The question i have is that what happen at Life esidimeni where by more that 100 people die under Cedani Mahlangu @kenneth mampa Kwaaaaaaaaaa!!! This is Ajay guptas lawer. He is prescribing the guptas participation. what a load of crap! face the music Ajay you coward im with Ajay gupter here you can ask any question s @Desmond Masilela my brother - we are the same in questioning that "@Tshepo Mahlangu Hahahaha! I guess Zondo is too professional this is a whitewash just like the esidimeni inquiry this is just time waisting 
59:28,1:00:37, There is no justice in South Africa "he is requesting ""The milk of human kindness"" for the guptas! Bwahahaahahahahahahaah" @Steemit OneAzania So you following this whitewash by choice. Why? No one can be captured unless their minds are weak. These guys sold the people out. Simple. Capture is an excuse This Guy is Wasting time Actually this guy should start by telling us when is he returning our land "Hellens sc @Norman Zwane just like you I follow it. Would you like me to stop following it? "@Paul de Bruyn Hahaha. Though 
1:01:05,1:03:20, @Steemit OneAzania Each to their own. I think the only way to get people arrested its only when people can appear in court of Law. That we can say yes people will be arrrested. @Steemit OneAzania "If his submission wins the day yes sellout is the right word not state capture @Desmond Masilela that's correct. The prosecuting authority doesnt want to build a case against their own people you are playing for time malungu...get your Gupta groper in that room man!!! @Thando Nkutha do you want me to go eat curry and be quiet too? 😃 Then this is a waist of money and time @Steemit OneAzania this inquiry is turning into journalists workshop. 
1:03:52,1:06:36, @Desmond Masilela it is a waste of our time and money - but it serves the establishment very well. so they will spare no costs They need this inquiry so they can argue they ware not pressing charges because there is an inquiry "that white guy he waste our time will we see Faith today? This guy is trying to delay the proceedings of commission of inquiry we want wetness here and bring gupters Thank you @Steemit OneAzania . Do you perhaps know if today will have someone to testify or tomorrow? Tea time "luthuli house 
1:06:41,1:08:50, Kenneth...two sugars please haha They started at 10:00am and just now they go for tea time. All we want people to testify even the one whom may be implicated must come to the commission to say their version Coffee @kenneth mampa Kenneth bwaah..tea shot haha Coming right away @Desmond How du u like black or white? 😁😁😁😁😁 @kenneth mampa. Thank you will be waiting. This hearing should have been a full blown high court case where the jury would arrive at guilty or innocent verdict. 
1:08:55,1:10:31, "@makhosi nobhatyi this is the nail you hit on th head sir - the fact is "Why they want to cross examine witnesses but they don’t want to say their story? Country has no money Gupta please pay back our money please "everyone who comes here is like the people in church LOL.....@Steemit OneAzania this men are wasting the state money Does this lawyer want to argue that no money was stolen from the country? "How much Joseph? let it be calculated first "@kenneth mampa As colours I don't have a problem with black or white 
1:10:35,1:13:25, henoch! he is arguing the law of south Africa "Steemit I understand brother Gupta won’t come here gupta saw and opportunity - a country being led by sellouts. of course he climbed in. the people are now looking for his head butthe guys who gave the keys to him - they will vote for them What is playing now is just ideological games... it's a charade like the trc and esideimeni and every other inquiry so far. I don't have a prblm with a word Orania but intended connotations @Hon Mbatha former EFF member of Parliament "Commisions  "meanwhile all implicated will have there day in court. 
1:13:27,1:16:05, Steemit Zuma and his buddies hide behind the laws and it clear that state capture is real happened "problem with people losing faith in these commissions is that there have never been consequences correct me here if I am wrong..this commission is costing us R 200 million for six months of enquiries? ?? @makhosi nobhatyi these guys minds are captured by greed. thats the only capture here. its like I give my keys to a gangsterthen claim my car is hijacked LOL Yes Steemit.. our lawyers make a killing out of all this but no one is convicted...sick society @Enoch Dipela the people in charge should have gone straight to jail while we make a case againstthem "@louis is going yo take twoo yrs All we know lawyers lie a lot as politicians @makhosi nobhatyi these lawyers here - 50%o f them and 50% of the journalists will be in parliament in ten years time 
1:16:15,1:18:35, Kenneth. ..that is a toilet full of money brother!!! So you charge people witout a case? so what would be the charge? you implicated in a state capture...really? "@Louis i agree with u "Jonathan please you must not be negative this will help country moving forward not being blinded those who claim they fight for poor but for themselves  "a Marikana commission set up by Zuma freed ramaphosa thgis gentleman is making strong arguments - the question is WHY a notion of capture and not - they are sellouts Aaaag am going to walk to Union B to ask a burden from minister of energy Maybe we need to give them the benefit of doubt this time around because they are aware of the impact of state capture and looting that has and continuing to take place in our country. here it come. Tea time. 
1:18:39,1:22:43, cheers people mayibuye Those lairs must be cross examined. @Desmond u can take a walk cause urs is finished... lol "@Kenneth. ..I agree The worst thing about elections are that the politicians always win. There is no clean governance anywhere in the world but when a government does not deliver then that is not acceptable Even white people were captured by the idea of apartheid. Guys marikana things we butter Ramaphosa who was in charge then in government isn’t Zuma? Have Zuma ever went to marikana? All CR was saying no more killings after those whom killed by strikers True that @ Ntuthuko "Ajuy Gupta said to Mcebisi - ""you don't want to help the DA but he's using DA laywer" 
1:22:46,1:33:16, brb... "Ntuthuko we can’t allowed that happen in front of us "i will invite malema and his colleagues to come and dance his song of pay back the money  "@makhosi nobhatyi Even without Zuma Makhosi khoza was strictly strong in view held officials accountable after she said Zuma must go and she was hunted "Norman Zwane I know wat you say it is because of people like Zuma and his allies DA is fighting to stop state capture but their laywer is fighting to disprove them @makhosi nobhatyi .ANC has no choice but defend him.Because if they had do admit to their faults the vultures that are circling would surely pounce "you can't aim on spending an ungrowing economy 
1:35:10,1:43:40, @Nkosikhona Ginya - what an idiotic statement "ANC was too afraid to face truth look where we are now? Still they want to use Zuma in election campaigns am lost here we want them here Sieze their assets in SOuth Africa "They dont want to supply their clients for interrogation "every single anc member Why these Guptas dont want to come and clear up their names. ? hahah reckless incompetence and an embarrasment - cant fault that statement 
1:44:50,1:46:09, "If we cant get this commission of inquiry right ok do it by video link "#Controversy... Guptas used black people to steal money Gupta knew exactly that will be arrested denial of laws so they get to call the shots again.. @Mpho Kgomotso - ffs - stop ur ignorant racist b/s Guptas are rude. they want the entire commission to move from South Africa to the area of their choice? They dont want to be physical appear to an Inquiry. "eish mara these guptas hey 
1:46:09,1:48:05, "Dlala dlala Guptas the steal the state money and they wanna call the shots This must just shut up now this is nonsense They (Guptas)claim that the very Hawks and NPA that they captured is now incompetent. Guptas are bloody arrogant they want the entire commission of enquiry to move outside South Africa to their own personal chosen place? ukudelela lokhu madoda. These are guilty without no doubt. Why are they running away and not want to come in the inquiry live. They want to bribe them now mxm The audacity of these Guptas to want to dictate to the commission That is becourse Zuma make them what they are 
1:48:06,1:50:20, But Gupta's are 100% correct Hawks and NPA reckless incompetence and an embarrassment to SA Why our judiciary have to treat these Guptas with romantic hands...Why not extradite them back here to face the music why the Guptas are not in court? Very bloody arrogant and it must be stopped. We cannot expect this commission to go and sit in Dubai. Is this a banana republic... how can we ask the implicated to dictate to feeble justice system ? @The Edge Search not really. They used Zuma to control these institutions and now Zuma is no longer a president and they talk lies. They know very well that they wanted people who can be controlled "Whites continue to reap the rewards of their previous privilege under this so called new economic system They must Stand before Zondo here in South Africa!😡😠 "The Guptas they trusted police 
1:50:46,1:52:54, "Let these criminals come here. Why are they running away if they are so innocent. This is not their country now Exactly my point King... Guptas Must stand before Zondo. here in SA😡 "So if they did not do anything Gupats know for the fact how useless they have rendered the Hawks ayasidelela lamaGupta bafwethu. companies have the same name but not the same company?? This language of incompetence is foolishness. How can you capture an institution and come back to say it is incompetence. Zuma & Guptas employed people they were working with in these jobs. Hawks and NPA was changed by them and former president 
1:52:55,1:54:20, Guptas through the toothless hwks should be extradicted to SA to answer "LAMA GUPTA UYADELALA Is the Judge breathing okay? Its all a joke. wasting time and our money "@Desmond Masilela my brother they know they are 110% guilty. The evidence is too strong "Where is ANC MPs who sad Thuli was working for whites and she is a spy? Zokwane is first J the are fugitives and theives and thugs "if Gupta's they say they done nothing rong in South Africa 
1:54:27,1:55:02, "It very hard to be a lawyer because this man knows very well Guptas are guilty international community to arrest the devils Dead arguement from the fugitives. How did the gupta know hawks npa are incomplete and reckless? Under mine Judge Zodo these Guptas want to be cross examined in Dubai...maybe they have a Saxonwold shebeen there as well "Is it maybe the Constitution which allows them to dictate @bonnie mazzie. They Gupta are disrespecting SA and its Law. want to meet outside SA why... gukty 
1:55:04,1:57:11, @Paul de Bruyn I wish Trump can order arrest against them in international court now. @Tulonga Henoch 😀 I think the judge needs to go to the gym... How does Duduzane feels about guptas utterances now; reckless incompetence ja ne "Incompetent of police its time to refer them to interpol Guptas undermines our constitution laws.....Incompetent is understatement. im tired of this person yaz why he says the commissiom is not incompleted They must have been informed by the old Sheriff at that particular period that they are incompetent. Guptas are basically using Section 7 (a) of the Euphonik Act of 2016 Msunu yenu Nonke 
1:57:17,1:58:44, Am so disappointed with you South Africa by supporting the Gupta in wat they say about state that is mess so what they are trying to say to the world about us He is also arrogant and must be put in his place by the Deputy Chief lamaGUPTA LAWA HEE "The Guptas knows very well that J Zondo is going to put this guy in order just watch Why Guptas don't hire black lawyers? iam glad that guptas are brutally honest they're scared to be arrested 😂😂😂 We Will Arrest them. They must come. We've been waiting for them. "First they corrupt the NPA 
1:58:49,2:00:34, That is the big question. Well-said @Werner Opperman. Exactly... 😂😂😂 They will simply switch the video link off if they feel in trouble.😂😂😅. They used our courts and won successfully before they put confidence in the very same system... so now what changed ? "hau bt Guptas won't be arrested They probably mst have managed to corrupt these Institutions This Advocate is been captured as well. This is logic. How on earth have someone appear in court or Inquiry via video link? Too late for them "@Thando Nkutha they made it clear in their wedding they hate blacks and racist 
2:01:01,2:02:33, 😂😂😂😂 Never has it happened before. video link. Desmond Masilela. Zuma will fall in the same stance as Guptas This advocate is talking k@k and he knows it govinda A lot of nonsense Dololo logic here He has been paid well by those fat cats Then they want to capture this inquiry too via the link maybe. @Gambu LOL "if we allow the GUPTAs to do this Rubbish 
2:02:34,2:04:06, This is a bloody joke "What we witnessing now is exactly the damage which these Zuptas have caused. It's more than the R100 billion + they looted. They rendered our institutions They must not be allowed to have anyone representing them if they don't want to come pleaseeeeeee! this advocate sat at home & thought this will be his argument?? Zondo is being taken for granted "You must wait for breaking news "we will not be dictated to by the bloody Guptas Thank goodness for an independent judiciary "Now it should end 
2:04:17,2:06:00, @Desmond Masilela. These busteds want to be able to simply switch off the video link if they feel offended during the cross examination. Guptas know the ineffectiveness of the hawks and npa as they easily ran away from their shenanigans right in their nose so no surprise Barry went get away with this argument its I'll logic period! Then his argument and thoughts is useless then. @Tozamile Funani 😁 "Why is it so easy to say Indians hate Blacks #paybackthebillions 😂😂😂😂😂@Gambu 😂😂😂 Barry is been all the time arrogant now is talking about been respectful cause is not able to get away with this stupid argument 
2:06:34,2:08:02, Time wasted yeses No offence to Zondo but swear I miss Judge Moseneke (Life Esidemini) "I’m not surprised They want to continue undermining us as a Country.
