Karma is bad bro "@Pastor J If the US government is capable of doing that to their own citizens "@Pastor J if i look at all the shacks and 27 %unemployment and the few who stole there should not be a comparison 
46:39,53:39, @Danie Nilsen You are spot on Danie. But the crooks dont care. Exactly - the ANC government feels absolutely nothing for us citizens and our suffering. They only want the money. @Derek Main I have over my many many years of living refused to travel to the USA or the UK. They have been Partners in all the crimes against so many innocent people. @Pastor J Yes - also have no interest in travelling there. They have a lot to answer for. "...Morals are not managed by the law or the church @I Am Free A beeeeeeeeeg one SABC please correct the date - is NOT the 3rd Sep!!! @Lee Hendrix A Might Big Amen to that dag en mag dit n vrutevol dag wees nie te goed begin nie 
54:34,57:05, @Gee Peex he sinking down and Zwane is running away leaving him in the mud whereas he directed this guy to do these decisions. I don’t feel anything for him now coz he is lying i ha ve theoretical qeustion is this Mavuma Mabung a foriegn language for stealing No wonder I was unable to pick up State Capture this morning..3rd September 🙈 Gee Peex1 The woman did not create herself. this guy don't want to implicate himself "the coomissiion started at 14 "@ Gee Peex he need to tell us who send him to implement the decision if no one said then he is guilty of looting money @Danie Nilsen They wanted to make sure you and I didnt understand what was going on behind those dark doors @Born free Commission wasn't sitting this morning - only started at 14h00. 
57:27,1:00:21, Evidence leader is on 👌👌👌👌👌 Da da da da wa wa wa wa @ Derek Main - the date is still wrong OH thanks.. Derek "@ Danie Nilsen ​ it mean ""grows from the soil""" @Neo Mjavell Yes - it is. Well spotted @Gee Peex1 You are confusing what @Lee Hendrix is saying. He was speaking spiritually and not physically @Phillip Cwazibe ty you fot that info in what language is it Swahille oe arab Hawks must arrest him 
1:01:51,1:05:21, "today's testimony is sooooo boring "...Genesis is not understood concerning Man who was the last creation and there is no 8th day "@ Gee Peex1 it Mohuma mobung. I am Zulu but if wrong @Lee Hendrix You are 100%correct. @Phillip Cwazibe thank you isisoto is the place where the milk pallace was going to happen This man is scared of mr Zwane "@Phillip Cwazibe Perhaps the intention was meant to be understood as ""from end to end and all around"" I could be wrong" @Gee Peex1 i think i did lol Zwane will get away here 
1:05:27,1:07:08, This man has no qualifications 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ it is so embarrassing @ Pastor J ​ the intention was excellent though it now seems as if was in fact a disguise of a nefarious agenda. 🤣🤣🤣yes VREET PROJECT almal het gevreet behalwe die koie hulle het gevrek @makhosi nobhatyi It's called cadre deployment. ...This guy is not going to admit his guilt. @Phillip Cwazibe Absolutely. Great project if they had implemented it instead of stealing from it. @ Danie Nilsen ​ mense ook. 
1:07:08,1:10:06, @ Danie Nilsen - Hahahahahahaha "@Derek main I agreed with you @Lee Hendrix By tomorrow he is going to be squeezed like how they should be milking those cows. baie waar and that is so sad he is under the wrong impression the judge mean he should be excecuted Thats cause the money was stolen "Pastor J..He took the money shares by instructions @ Danie Nilsen this man think we are playing here he supposed to be in jail coz money is not there No opportunity because they stole from the project from the onset. 
1:10:27,1:12:27, @makhosi nobhatyi he is heading there one way ticket hopefully polsmoor Ch ch ch chair eish @ Danie Nilsen I worked a full 5 years in community development. The poor people on the ground get misled and robbed off their projects because of poor education. polsmor with a Gucci orange suit 😂😂😂😂😂😂 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 my favorite is Buffalo soldier and it seems it is cr too lol @ Danie Nilsen I don’t understand how did this man not arrested he cannot make any sense about operation duties so he saying the money was never spent 
1:12:51,1:16:10, @Gee Peex1 surely meant as a joke the WMC Now he must explain what happened to the money eish 30 million ayear What more opportunities need to implement? "@Phillip Cwazibe I hear you. I once was asked to do a funeral service in a squatter camp. The Govt paid R1500 for a coffin but when I got there that they will not pay for the grave It could never have been one of the greatest projects because they kept stealing from the funds so it would never see an Implementation. The seat is getting 🔥🔥🔥 "...The article was written to expose the theft of funds Because the money that was allocated was not used for the project. 
1:16:20,1:19:32, lol amanga ayabambana and a small gate This is the reason poor people remain poor so how much was stolen before the article was done on waterkloof the witness is confusing and implicating himsel i went there as i am in freestate odendaalsrus and i was in construction many years what i saw there at most 1-2 million and that will be overtime rate The witness is already implicated Today the Evidence Leader is active... Big ups to The African Sister... agreed she is on the ball .... the witnesses kwaaks 
1:19:51,1:24:33, Instead of Milking the cows these BUGGERS milked Treasury. The couldnt read the script right @Diss & Dad Yes they have killed before. They run the FS like the mafia. Gangster state. they milked the poor cows so dry they died bone dry It was all an idea to steal allocated funds from @Diss & Dad That's more or less what he is in the FS. Zondo is now no longer standing on neutral ground. why would treasury quote the article if the article did not have influence on their decision for withdrawal? why go to india for that we have black dairy famers in kroonstad mafekeng and more in kzn but not one of them was asked @ Gee Peex1 I think this gentleman is trying to say that the illegal landing of the Gupta landing brought to light the illicit involvement of the Guptas in the Estina matter. @ Gee Peex1 ​ I am with you. 
1:24:46,1:27:43, the whole rotten apple here is spelled ACE @Danie Nilsen No - it's spelt A.N.C. This guy will implicate Ace The truth shall set you FREE. when is Mr ACE Magasule taking a witness stand? I'm anxiously waiting for that day. Doom doom Or lock you up @Diss & Dad Magashule is still acting with impunity. The Ace of corruption is Next 
1:27:55,1:31:08, doom doom for Ace the fly 😅😅😅😅😅 "...The Gupta s and clan are not coming back to Africa to answer questions  @Gee Peex1 true i agree with you there are rotten appels every where in all cultures on the flipside at the bantu.s braai and black label the same thing is thing this criminality of state capture is not helping our tax money as culprit are still enjoying being liberation freedom even after stealing from poor @Raven Penny I recall that in my youth we used small fish as bait to catch the bigger fish. Not sure still if the big fish was stupid or i was clever.hahahahaha no he's pr and lawyers are watching @Diss & Dad He should be in a jail cell where he is not able to watch. It's not helping our Country at all. The rand has devalued. prices have rocketed and more people are unemployed. @Dakalo Netili Exactly - that's their only interest - their own pockets. They feel nothing for the people of SA. Thanks for that you ANC voters. 
1:32:07,1:36:11, Those who voted the ANC should all pay back the money i think the cows commited ciucide @I Am Free Not even the Prison Farm? The cows died of starvation there are no more to give back and no one will lend us a cent @Born free no they have gone one a hunger strike @Diss & Dad I'm smart enough to know that the entire ANC is corrupt to the core. that is called cross exsamination ssshhhh Danie 
1:36:28,1:38:32, "take him down guys  lol He's knotting himself here. you don't want to say what you know "@Diss & Dad You look at every ward he did found a probono one @Diss & Dad You've been in Germany too long. You lost touch with what's happening on the ground. this witness is ducking A liar is a Lawyer. Best he does not have one. 
1:39:00,1:42:04, "@Diss & Dad As for your ""agent"" comment "@Gee Peex1  a regime change who will look after our country and its people it is not a bad idea He chose not to have a Lawyer because it would make him look guilty. "Bornfree That's exactly what a spy would say. i am a spy i spy on my wifes use of any cards even cristmas cards "@Diss & Dad Of course "@Diss & Dad You know the story of the boy who cried ""Wolf!""" 
1:42:30,1:44:41, Derek they are in denial they know that the anc can't run a spasa shop "Gee -peex. Take a chill pill or smoke a joint "in this instance it was crying ""cows""" enjoying the interview like on the interrogation panel @Diss & Dad I'm glad you are able to make that concession - it's plain for all to see. i miss it this guy and Ace got tail between their legs in court yes Adv Gcabashe is my best evidence leader. 
1:44:58,1:47:11, hofmeter she has got him by the tail😂😂😂 hofmeyer Molefe what tail lol Driving and watching State Capture at the same time is quite a skill plz stop and watch we do not want you to be watsoned @Born free Thats a skill that may or hopefully may not need my services.hehehehehe 
1:47:16,1:49:05, lOLS... THABETHE IS ASSISTING HAHA 😂😂😂I have time commitments. @Born free ... and typing!! You're gifted. 🏋️‍♂️🏋️‍♂️ Ace must be shaking now 🤣🤣🤣🤣Luckily I am ambidextrous they play with us "Chair Zondo is ageing very fast now @Diss & Dad I absolutely think so. Particularly those held in the Vineyards rather than the Graveyards Ace the thug 
1:50:31,1:52:19, Ace remember you next that is a truthfull lie Mr Magashule should be invited or rather volunteer to appear at the inquiry The lawyer representing mr Thabethe will run away too ace will never go to prison batholi is spineless and her boss Cyril is without any courage 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 """hit the dog till the owner comes out!!" @Kevin Davis I totally totally and respectfully disagree with you. It is going to happen. Very soon "Ace Magashule will never come at free will 
1:52:28,1:55:12, Cyril is letting due processes play out. magashule has a apartment in Dubai if things go appleshaped and of they go pear shaped as a apartment in kokstad Zondo is digging deeper now He did say he will come to the inquiry if invited. c max in kokstad Magashule needs a quid pro qo 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 orange suits for all 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 go zondo go 
1:55:43,1:59:33, Derek in the early 80s did you frequent the YMCA on joburg Mr Thabethe got mixed up with the wrong crowd and now he is in a position of be eaten by crocodiles or lions. shasha eaten by zulus all Zulu s love corruptuon he was on the table then but now he is on the menu It was clean until now. Really Kevin Davis a man walks up to a porch puts his gun in the window says to the driver give me all Your money and the driver says I happen to be a zuma The robber then says well in that case give me all my money 
2:00:10,2:04:06, thando am I wrong then all cats are animals therefore all animals are cats Kevin .. in kzn all the Zulu wanted Zuma ex wife to continue the state capture zondo is frying this guy😂😂😂😂😂😂 thando who are u to tell me what to type the truth is the truth Nowonder Zwane didn’t gave two forms to sign by this guy fault and proper thando tell me who did u want to take over from Zuma Cyril or dlamini zuma thando are all black people racist Dlamini not out the hook also😁😁😁😁😁 
2:04:16,2:06:30, What has racisism got to do with corruption I think this Kevin is a stupid person agreed Zulu s all love Zuma its a fact difficult question agree with Kevin... Race got nothing to do with theft nonwhoevwr u must be zulu where you got that all Zulu love Zuma thando lol the truth stinks 
2:06:30,2:07:37, "@Pedro P. The opening salvo from Kevi was ""all zulus are corrupt"". Do u agree and find that statement appropriate?" no Zulus are not homogeneous in their thinking is this the level of expert running our country ! nsa mabitso topis Thank you @Pedro P. Only Zulu’s I must say @ Kevin Davis South Africa starts to turn against Zuma 😂😂😂😂 Only Zulu’s I must say @ Kevin Davis South Africa starts to turn against Zuma 
2:07:38,2:09:02, mr thabete must answer a simple question all Zulu s run like this agree Zulu don't like corruption or I will block u no wonder u like magashule Judge Zondo's questions 👌 lol bambamba And I myself love Zuma because for the first time I saw white people mashing because of the pressure there were under "Leave Zulus are alone "Hhahahahaahahha "the witness is equivocating This guy 😂😂😂

2:12:40,2:15:24, When kids learn that the government do crime and steal they think its ok Greetings to you @Jane .Blamire he must just tell the truth and seek to be protected simple who is the guy stairing at the witness? zwane gave affidavit that what ahe relies on at thus point kevin get a life Kunuka ukunya apha qha this man makazikhulule please give me his number I would advice him achaze wathunywa ngubani is it the and position if you are south african maths is not important as long as u can steal now he is busy going in circles trying to protect the people that got him into trouble

Sasha 👍👍👍 pastor trust me the entire nation cannot do maths Only people named Kevin cant do math ask Helena to multiply 7 time 9 and he just looks at u and he has a degree 30% pass 😂😂😂😂😂 anc make the ground rules of ruining the country and the people all say we will vote for u mahendra I am from the UK not from kzn 
2:18:26,2:23:02, @Kevin Davis I find it troubling how you so easily belive that you can insult an entire Proud Zulu nation simply because of how you feel about Zuma.? Dont you think an apology is necessary? pastor who voted for him even after they found about the crime @Kevin Davis But that does nor represent an entire Zulu Nation? or does it? Really!!!!!!!! @ Kevin Davis looking for mr Thabethe number proud Zulu nation is long gone its now crime and yea they were a proud tribe but when the entire tribe supports corruption what impression do u want me to have makhozi kids the exception makhozi koza the exception this guy is in deep trouble @Kevin Davis I am saddened that you still do not see the need to apologise or withdraw your earlier hurtful statement. Very sad indeed. End of this line of interaction for me.

I can also point at Dongote HE HE HE 
2:46:18,2:48:51, @Kevin Davis. Just like Steve Hofmeyer Im the one questioning is India better in farming than SA??? 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 😂😂😂😂😂😂 now they will need to investigate the fish business and the cost going through it. @Pedro P. India has large small scale farming but is not ideal @Mangalani Mangalani And lets not forget the highly successful farmer Uncle Eugene Terreblanche.hehehehehehe Pedro P. ​is India better in farming than SA??? They feed over a billion people with very little agri imports. So yes! Mangalena you are speaking rubbish showing your low IQ. 
2:49:31,2:57:04, India got 1960 technology in farming "I've visited India many times before. Yes they may use dated technology and labour intensive methods but they do very well Indians are starving now... sad but true The scale of the population matters. The number of obese people in India is greater than SA total population. The number of poor probably exceeds RSA population many times over. India is milking buffaloes more than cattle 1 billion 300 thousand live in India. and Rat eating is done in the countryside. population could have grown even more. but note India has the top ten growing cities in the world. hard workers. sam soto ​I'm a scientists PhD? we not doing well at cricketing against India right now cientists in opening shops 🙄🙄🙄🙄
