35:28,42:23, 😱 RRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Former DA Gauteng Chairperson has become the latest former DA leader to join Herman Mashaba's ActionSA John Moody joins ActionSA Mzalwane Mzala what is your honest view about Mashaba party It disrupts the DA's foray into townships @Elvis Malakoane they all have memory loss 😑 Mzalwane Mzala But do you think it will make it as a party Music Maimane should join Herman it will be a real force 
43:14,47:35, It will gain local government seats in Johannesburg and possibly Tshwane. Mzalwane Mzala I think so too . l So it will survive as one of the small parties. It will not be at the EFF scale. Mzala if these 2 guys form a rainbow exec. they will draw a lot of votes Mzalwane Mzala But I think I most municipalities eff will work with Mashaba Than work with ANC Which 2 guys @Eddie Reddy? I dont think Herman will work with EFF after the Thawne problem. Herman is very refined @Elvis Malakoane The second biggest party is the DA and not the EFF. Is Mashaba prepared to work with the DA? 
47:37,50:34, I'm interested to know why zondo is so pedantic in his questioning around the timing of zumas entrance at the meeting of the 8th Back at last There is nothing wrong with him checking the timing its his job 👀 Mashaba is principled he won't work with da 🌵 I know dudu says he wasn't there. he probably has a strategy for when zuma comes 🍄 Dudu could have misled the commission 
50:37,52:20, Mashaba is making a mistake by not personally contesting the Mayorship of Johannesburg. He can still lead the party from Johannesburg. He is popular in Johannesburg I cant wait will have to book leave 🍣 sabc must not deprive us of engaging. yes now we know that she lied. tsosti placed zuma in the meeting and now linell @Gundo agree! ☔ 🌩🌧 "so Dudu Myeni lied under oath 
52:36,54:48, 🎃👻 oh yes she did Dudu next arrest of course she did Hawks must arrest this guy tonight pls he's wasting time .it's clearly that he knows everything was happening there . she said why would the president interfere. she denied it Dudu can pick up the rand afterwards Dudu start organizing your bail "So Zuma and Myeni 
54:58,56:41, is this man in trouble Lizel of course Dudu is protecting JZ what's that called? perjury? no doubt guy's what about BRA Ace ? This men knows everything. lock him up oh hes going down. just a matter of time His day is coming we are close to find him @Khena which one Lorraine ? 
57:38,1:00:02, "Seriously we tired of this corruption  Ke le batla One by one ~DCJ Ray Zondo 2020 "going to jail at this age dudu myeni lied and lied and lied some more Now i understand why EFF called her Dudu Myeni Zuma. "@Lezi...she lied a lot This guy is also lying. Leizel to garner evidence if Zuma influenced the ridding of the exec. to bring in the Gupta men how old is Gugu Myeni now ? 
1:00:05,1:01:43, He knew the targets before meeting @Lezil they should call her back @blake I'm sure they will. to tie things up state capture enquiry is a waste of money..evidence is there already we didn't need this commission. if i was a seating President i was going to issue notices of arrest myself with no Batoyi. "That why former commanders called meeting To let her tie herself up in her own lies "Dolan please tell me who is this guy giving evidence she thinks shes smart 
1:01:49,1:03:43, MK veterans trying to distract citizens from the current issues this is mr linell dudu myeni legal adviser she still young and rich she's must prepared to go inside Nicholas Linnell Thank u zolile age does not matter when someone has to go to jail. look at Richard mdluli and his Co-accussed. @ALTA jy nog hier? "Lorraine this guy is Linell Eddie thanks 
1:03:44,1:06:24, you right Dudu they must go Linell is the fixer bob hewit correct Antoinette This Dudu hands was really all over in the cookie jar wow interference with weather they must call jabu wow ENCA is also off "And she didnt had money to come to the commission 
1:06:25,1:09:16, inoba ebenento yokwenza noBaba I have some questions for him is it not towers because of the storms or something This zoom commission is not working for me swak!!!! Haibo Is mr Linel still alive? @Elvis i think is the storm i passed Parktown and Auckland park an hour ago the weather there is so bad 🤣🤣😃😃
