The sassa grant could've been more than R350. Sekgololo we juju the red brigade thats our only hope. Juju is the future 350 is an insult Mayb we got de wrong person Makwanazi

51:09,51:56, the ANC see R350 as a reasonable amount for our majority black poor population Some vote for ANC due to lack of suitable opposition. DA would probably bring back apartheid principles.
