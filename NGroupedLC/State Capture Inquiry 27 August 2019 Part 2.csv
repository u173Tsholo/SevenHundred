He put all these state capturers in SOE's Ooooops! am here... @Lucricia Vorster Wasn't the business outside of South Africa - in the rest of Africa? Business is business "CR said if his kids ever consider doing business woth government and he so much as get a whiff of corruption Bossasa in SA....Bossasa in other countries....what is the difference? We all knew that they were crooks by then but still CR Junior took their business? "@ Gee Peex1 it out there public "@Cerebis True "@Cerebis you are correct 
34:32,37:22, Mr X "@carnoth ngomane As a private person yes their voices are very soft coz of the nice food they've eaten 😜 The chair is losing his hearing ES aka X is just scared Andile admitted that he did not pay attention to obvious red flags when he entered into agreements with Bosasa can't wait till ANC has to appear. Wait until I appear When Andile concluded business with Bosasa they were already n redflag institution..eoth regards to fraud...Why did they change their name to AGO??? 
38:04,42:14, Funny how they speak so softly here but at rallys and secret rendezvous they are very articulate and LOUD "But Andile never slept at Gavin Watson’s house "@Cerebis i here you but he cannot stop living simply because his father is the president transpired not expired but were they not naughty lol caught eith their hands in the cookie jar...

55:10,57:22, He LOVES the sound of his voice this guy if they instructed to come forth with possible fraud/corruption issues why are we still having this inquiry one year later with no one brought to book.people are rather dying(dissapearing)mysteriously He's out of order now he is hovering around He's already defending himself since he appears in the CR17 files...he takes us for fools this corrupt cadre. Socialism is so wonderful "thula bo Me2 I agree @Thando Nkutha. He is jumping the gun. cCR17 is still coming here. 
57:33,1:00:33, yes you can ask again what was the question Defending attitude now.... ai He is out of order ngoku This guy should teach history this is verbal diarrea "@Sindiswa Moolman ...his name already appears in the CR17 is this people getting paid for just talking?we will never get closure for all this...

1:41:19,1:42:42, ewe "Poverty was too painful. Nothing we say will make them understand. This is deeper than our micro government. IMF and Stellenbosch Mafias get final say kushubile la Sanitizing forensic reports. Shots will be fired here. interesting now .... Am i the olny one concerned about how Watson died while the NPA is sitting idly by having not even prosecuted or begin to prosecute a single case. Who is next on the hitlist? DCJ? okay ...here we go popcorn time yooh this guys are here for a mission yoohh they dont want to leave anything 
1:43:27,1:46:15, Number one as glorified by his stooges destroyed both ANC and Free State economy we thought at the time he had brains....tjo low blow Manfred Nkonki ​Am i the olny one concerned about how Watson died while the NPA is sitting idly by having not even prosecuted or begin to prosecute a single case. perhaps @Boikutlo Manogi It is called the end of times....revelations """this man has brains""" @Cerebis ya true story. Jesus is coming back soon. this is proof. Amen @ Concerned South African what if there was a meeting between Bosasa and the NPA investigators? little ditcheee...little did we know 
1:46:52,1:47:49, now he's speculating "Am I the one who thinks that Zitha Even the judiciary in Free State is in their pockets.This needs urgent attention from the Chief Justice. malema was right the judiciary is captured ..but chef justice dinnies that "@Siphosethu Nase  this commission would've been done by now if they investigated the people that is not implicated @Cerebis Unfortunately we are incorrect! ITS called AFFIRMATIVE REPOSSESION (haha!) wow in Bloemfontein you don't lose a case Judge's in Freestate work with ACE ? 
1:48:16,1:49:24, ppl in free state and bfn have been saying this all along no one listened hahaha skwash the case mogoen mogoen uthini "@Yin Yang If our constitution is so great Now he's spilling the bins... Thando Nkutha ​Judiciary is captured. He is saying just that. what did you do when you saw that things are wrong this guy is factual and i think if he was lying he would have slipped up and not once has he stuttered or said he doesnt know So even the courts can be captured 
1:49:28,1:50:11, Before pastors 😂😁😂😂 "According to Dukwana Rumors where is the proof @Derek Main Nah thats the NPA and the ANC protecting their own the Free State is indeed Free not rumours! he was there to see it @ thami nobela "This is very Serious what did he do then I am worried about this guy.He will need a 24 hour protection. 
1:50:12,1:50:53, Mmmmmm judiciary The truth will come out!!!!!!! the Judiciary is compromised. the Police compromised. The NPA compromised "@michael ne ke batla go utlwa ka bo Pastor pastors yah he must be protected The Commission is coming for Free state Court """If Tshidi from Generations the Legacy was a person""" Judiciary is captured and media also captured @Manfred Nkonki I hear you but our constitution allowed all these things to happen when it should have protected us from them happening. 
1:51:17,1:52:34, so far there's no proof @David cele Unfortunately that is Incorrect! its called Affirmative Repossession my brother. Welcome to Communist-Capitalism! new gavin watson = ace magashule He's saying the judiciary in the Free State is compromised. He didn't say the whole country. This man turns Agrizzi's testimony to Sunday school picnic. Even touching Pastors and judges in their studio. lol yes now agrizzis testimony is a small fly """If Nomatshidiso was a person""- Mr Watson" @Derek Main The constitution provides us with the greatest degree op protection. e.g. section 9 institutions. However these institutions are run by people who are only looking out for number 1 
1:52:52,1:54:45, @david cele Yoh baba @Concerned South African Absolutely. Of course it's bad not information Zondo. proof this testimony is beyond Aggrizze testimony @Manfred Nkonki But that is my whole point. Surely the constitution should make it impossible for the cadres to defend and protect a constitutional delinquent? He's looking for a plea bargain!! Pastor Lekota "@Derek Main It allows for a motion of no confidence. And will all those motions "Our constitution is flawed. The political parties must not appoint MP""s but the people should directly vote them in. The MP's serve the Political Party and not the people." 
1:55:01,1:56:25, @Siphosethu Nase ...and Papa Leshabane be MamZondiwe hahaha hirinng someone older than 65 woow "@Manfred Nkonki And if the speaker of parliament and corrupt cadres decide there should be no motion of no confidence @Manfred Nkonki ...you are spot on Bra..... the old age committee a 67 year old is employed while the youth are just roaming the street @Derek Main Thats where the judiciary steps in. Jooooooooo Ntate Moruti Lekota banna @Manfred Nkonki If they are not compromised ala Seriti 
1:56:31,1:57:59, Linelani sounds like Faulty Towers? "@Gee Peex1 it does lindelane @Derek Main thats why our courts make it possible to appeal and review a court's decision Eeeesh...the cancer that set in has really made the ANC rotten...ne..... What's the name of this honorable man testifying? hulle is lendelam system "@Derek Main Im not saying our constitution is perfect 
1:58:00,1:59:18, And its called....Money Cancer...heheh Innocent baba why lindeni not straight home Agrizzi no 2 please tell me guys what is he holding in tha hidden hand halfway stop Supernumeraries. And the State doesn't have a wage bill problem. "@Manfred Nkonki I'm saying considering where we have gone to as a country dukwa = agrizzi 
1:59:39,2:01:52, What is the problem with these technicians. Ntate Dukwana is Aggrizzing us yhoo!!!. Akanavalo tu!!! nix This political discussion @Derek Main That is on the shoulders of the NPA. The couts cannot force the NPA to institute chargers or not to drop chargers. Zuma is facing his charges as we speak. Poor soles.....the ANC has brainwashed da peoples.......true story.. @Manfred Nkonki Then the constitution needs to be changed so that the NPA can be compelled to take up some cases and not fob them off like Abrahams did. Do you think he will come @ David cele how this man becomes SG 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ we really have problems @Derek Main which aspects of the costitution do you believe should be improved? 
2:02:12,2:04:10, This comrade is spitting fire🔥 This guy is maybe aiming at putting Ace at the centre of all shenanigans happened in the Free state province? Cadre deployment.... cornerstone of ANC policy ---and Corruption "@Manfred Nkonki As for Zuma Comrades and credit cards....eish maan @Thando Nkutha soon. "The free contact numbers 0800 222 097 of this commission are out of service and many people are unable to access the commission. It is the government today is a reflection of whats happening in churches stru Mr X 
2:04:11,2:06:12, "@Manfred Nkonki There are many but off the top of my head @Derek Main No doubt. I fully agree. Zuma appointed people in powerful positions. NPA. So maybe if the JSC appoints the NPA? Dukwana is having fun @Derek Main NDPP i meant @Manfred Nkonki We should have regular referendums to vote on important issues. @Derek Main 100% Agree! collection area 😅😅😅😂 "@ kay kay he is highlighting how the problem started caused by them protecting those who done wrong let the man speak 
2:06:36,2:07:47, @Manfred Nkonki I don't know - don't have those stats at hand. I know that less and less people are voting because it's futile. People are disillusioned with it all. Dukwane is dropping names 😂😂 It seems Mr. Dukwana and Ace has a silent fight like Cyril and Zuma had theirs in the past. Penny they stop him its really getting hot bring names tomorrow Zondo is waisting time sowaar @Derek Main exactly. Thats why following the american system will not be beneficial to us. Whole day was short time only? 
2:07:50,2:09:47, @Manfred Nkonki Not sure I trust the JSC - Hlophe is still there. That is the gist of how he state was captured. Ace Magashule will deal with the poor witness... @Manfred Nkonki Sorry? I don't get your connection to the american system. "@If not the JSC @Bonke masithembe bazakumkhusela kuninzi asekuthethile really is this commission a joke or part of the system @Manfred Nkonki Which is probably why we need to adopt the Chinese model for dealing with corruption - death! If you never did corruption please type Not me? 
2:09:59,2:11:03, Not me @BONKE XAKATHA Not me yor this is a farce #iamcorruptionfree not me @Derek Main Wrt electing our president directly.( i presumed that you meant the way they do in the USA) So i am saying because of our voter turn out that wont give results didnt you steal sugar? hahaa not me "@Derek Main LoL constitution protects everyone's right to life
