time,10:11,message will the implicated officials ever held accountable? Prosecution will only start after the nèxt general elections in 5 years when the EFF takes over government and then all criminals will be pardoned. Could anybody explain why (Showerhead) Zuma has not been asked to attend? This Chair lady is hot😍😘 😍😍😍 They are already pardoned. look at the ministerial appointees in government. Gwede Mantashe etc. really "When are are they starting 
10:32,16:27, "Mantashe is crap "Zuma is not here cause they say they are still looking for evidence. they themselves are the ones who said Zuma was eating money It's not Mantashe's age that bothers me - it's his lack of moral integrity. Zondo is going to be nice today i can promise that! who is this prisoner? what has she done? @Lutholwethu Nkohla Mzantsi She is loool😍 who's that now advertising And how long before she noticed the thieves had taken-over the department?
