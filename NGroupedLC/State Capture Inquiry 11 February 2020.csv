time,8:18,message Does RET change WNC into BMC. Sure seems that way from what I've seen and heard in this Commission. Gorgeous outfit beautiful as the outfit may be however it is not suitable for the witness's arms Nice outfit Wow! I don’t do fashion policing. Each to his or her own Zondo is bullying Adv Memela oh my oh my...what a disgrace to appear at the commission dressed like it was a party outfit not appropriate! 
8:31,12:08, dont judge her on her clothes. eliot chauke please wake up "well her attitude is despicable "Looks beautiful exactly party😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I think the outfit is amazing too @Corlé Jensen needs booom

14:33,18:22, @Paul Buchel the head piece looks like the the emblem for SAAF exactly kitchen is getting hot for some people so early It is becoming quite obvious why SAA is in the doldrums today. Incompetency of the SAA Management and the Board. Ms Mbanjwa uugh trying to run around the facts that Mamela is guilty...fact true Stop beating around the bush!! indeed yes - no question resulting in an overly long defense 
19:09,21:57, Ms. Maimela. Just be honest This lady is wasting time....! I wouldnt want her to be my lawyer chairperson must tell her to sit down she is wasting time. "This advocate is meticulous If there was no tender which was won by JM would they still have paid the R2.5 m for her house drop Mike !

35:12,36:42, "well these ""few minutes"" add up" @Cedric Man Yan Maybe its the dodgy curry break they are not going to come to an agreement This is not how innocent people behave.

"This mamela women is something else This woman must go to jail she had captured SAAT. "Michael Rijsmus ​ Is she cringing because the ""bribe""money came through her firm." This is now ridiculous.

1:38:50,1:42:27, please leave her outfit out as a subject of disrespect. its nit what is on trial and is disrespectful to make comments that may lead to arguments. let's rather focus on the role she had and debate it. More importantlyly Z knows she is lying blinking eyes too much is a sign of lying @laura lee kruger 🤣🤣🤣 More water please chair!!😂😂😃 @Michael Wild -Agreed. Her attire is her choice and her taste.

She wants to draw corruption from withdrawal of a tender and the partnership as signed. she wanted to make sure bee people got tender at all costs! @Gareth Hellyar.. she knew exactly what to do and that is why she manipulated the processes. 
2:10:38,2:12:59, was there? simple question "What controls the actions of a company Here we go can anybody advice me which party to vote next local elections please I am partyless she seems to be interested in convincing the public that she is not corrupt It's amazing what she can remember when it suits her. the dagga party "True that Rob Nel "@Gabisile Mabuza
