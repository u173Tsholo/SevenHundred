17:58,20:41, "why don't the lawyers just say ""among others""?" among other things.

Guys why Tom Moyane want to Cross X Gordahn morning guys Moyane is still bitter for being fired from SARS . So he is trying to get back at him Is one not suppose to put their story first before they cross examine someone who has put their story forward

Gordhan must be cross examined Gordhan..will have right of Reply Mpofu is flip flopping as usual Moyane grabbing at straws 
25:14,28:42, He is of course the chair of the Extreme Flip Floppers "Prime Mister Gordhan is running he keeps losing Wally correct What is Pravin hiding? when is this clown going to win a case? Pravin fear being exposed So are going to waste time instant of question the witnesses. Ahw shame he won one ya Supra 
28:58,31:07, This pravin guy also isnt as clean and innocent is we are made and meant to believe. let Pravin be cross examined.. I dont even understand wt is he saying.he dont finish the setence. The thing is we are going to accuse people without any evidence I agree ...Let them Face Off against each Other Why don't Monyane take testify himself? Moyane must also come to the party. Moyane is guilty -you can see the way he's fighting Eish.Mpofu is silencing the Chairman 
31:09,33:19, Moyane has to put across his version first BEFORE cross examining Gordhan . Gordhan is the devil of black leader bring him on and expose him.Let him run to India He dont know wt he gonna kick Mpofu being schooled here . True @Uncle this is a storm in a teacup of the EFF...They like to spread discord Chief Justice vs SC this has nothing to do with the EFF now... Mpofu is over zealous...a mistake why is this zondo protecting gordhan? 
33:19,34:55, I dont think he is one of the best advocate we have.can he stand with mr Malika? EFF are promoting corruption Deputy Chief Justice vs SC EFF = Extreme Flip Floppers . zondo protecting gordham Musa. why do you say Gordhaan is a devil. Mpofu over power the chair heheheh What did Gordhan do but go against the EFF and Zuma?That is the crux of the matter.They are being exposed as thieves and they don't like it "Why the EFF Guy is protecting the corrupt Moyane 
35:17,36:24, "Chair we are watching  Mr. Moyane will ask the judge to recuse himself. Mpofu don't disturb the chair The EFF says Gordhan is the devil and their followers regurgitate the hate This application will fail simply. because Moyane has not provided a version of the things he disputes. The chair enjoys listening to himself "@Magda Seguin who is the thief EFF followers are the biggest sheep . They believe EVERYTHING their leaders say . and the advocate can help 
36:26,38:06, simple Prince K..wats his version Again this has nothing to do with the EFF can Dali listen please . is he trying to bully the chair. disgusting. Mpofu is too over emotional....very revealing shame on you exactly @ Singi clearly gordhan pays this judge @Singi Mathebula don't worry Zondo is a competent professional YouTube legal experts are the funniest 
38:08,39:01, Singi since he started talking did pick any facts from him.?? Spha Nkosi are you saying this judge is a crook like Zuma? ANC using EFF....how can this be @Slindile Ngcobo maybe EFF using ANC who knows @Uncle the EFF is a quasi military outfit perpetuating hate and violence...They are a disgrace in parliament I like the red tie "Guy Mpofu is a member of EFF Prince K. Dube Agree holy inter alia 
39:40,40:40, After the commission Pravin must leave South Africa .India will welcome him and his daughters.I know what happens in trains of India. Dali banna Dali = Extreme Flip Flopper . untouchable Joshua doore Musa I think you must shut up. you know nothing about politics. What is the EFF standing for-No corruption and other things Dali ...dont speak for DCJ hands off our Chair Dali Mpofu why does this idiot keep interrupting the judge..he is so overated as an advocate..what a joke 
40:55,41:56, you not in his league Dali Mpofu is the best history will judge This time you wont be successful Dali Adv.Mpofu....no decorum at all...interupting and talking over the Chairman The hatred that even Juju has and that they are using moyane to further their cause Dali his on our timeline daily u like it or not Malema tax money.he hate Pravin bcz he is the one who gave him the bill. his chaowing this money for free 
42:05,43:52, I like Red tie the people's Advocate Dali get all this top cases all the time I think the illegal cigarette mafia is happy with Mpofu today Mr Mpofu is ill prepared. Michael Michael it was time not about gordan Magda he will pump more millions 1652 mob niyadina yazi.this has nothing to do with EFF Adv Pretorious looks very embarrassed for Mpofu this guy mara 
44:09,45:39, Dali got this one So Ou Moyane still have chelete to fight things like this? Even if is a case between chicken and a cat never hire Dali he is disgrace. "I was trusting mpofu Pravin says we must connect the dots ...but he doesnt want the commission to connect the dots mpofu is the best ive counted about 6 personal attacks on Gordhan so far...this is what they wanted..a forum and podium to try and change the narrative..hopefully the judge will see through this @Michael Michael go hire your Adv....Dali get all this top briefs for your info...doent deal with light matters I am surprised that a professional expose himself like this for someone who has been publicly exposed as a captured crook 
45:48,46:58, he can't give the chair where moyane implicated. Semantics @1duanef.. I agree with you. Moyane is wasting our time Moyane must grow up now. "gordhan ONLY complained about state capture after he was fired by zuma Michael Michael hates Mpofu are an Indian bra? race card expired now Funani you are wasting your own time.Moyane doesn't know u 
47:07,48:03, Grow up Mpofu. Youre ridicolous. Mpofu Mr. Moyane wants his job back. That is all. Mpofu is not my favourite BUT i like what he is into. to crash that Joshua Door to the finest powder. @Thando Nkutha. This way out of state Capture. Where does Malema come in here Wena Indian RACE...Is boring...Agreed dali mpofu for chief justice If Johnnie Cochran was still alive I would wish Mpofu could go against him in a court of law 
48:05,49:23, Now I'm convinced that this is just an EFF sponsored application to cross examine PG...there is just no grounds and this does not make any sense Judge now giving a lecture. Moody does not acknowledge what the Judge is saying...listening but not hearing Mfofu is lying when he's the chairperson of eff he condemns Moyane now he's defending him News hour: EWN understands that the ANC resolved that only those members found guilty by the court of law should be removed from the party’s list. *Mpofu Dali is doing his job leave the EFF @Thando Nkutha. Tom Moyane want to cross X Gordah. Mpofu doesn't get paid by government 
49:23,50:30, @Tobo Lwandile don't confuse yourself. we're dealing with the law now. testing allegations. @Vanessa...it's very obvious Dali pretending to represent Moyane while it's a clear EFF project. he's the same Dali whether in eff or doing his job if Gordan is so clean why doesnt want to be cross examined is gordhan hiding something? spha obviously "Dali mpofu is in the area @Thando Nkutha. Correct. 
50:39,52:01, VIVA EFF Pravin is shivering 😰😰 halagasha @Thapelo Motabogi ! The EFF tried to implicate Gordhan with false information in Canada @Thando Nkutha. You welcome. The arrogant Pravin must come and be cross examined in 1912 Gordon caught Malemas fingers in the Limpopo prov. that's how he got expelled from the ANC. again Gordon caught him for tax evasion. now Malema attracts the whole Indian race. Zondo too civilized. Stop these Eff skelms. O can see that the EFF 'fighters' are out in force on this thread

Monyane is clutching at straws..afraid to go to jail...all the SARS evidence is in the public domain.I blame the Sunday Times disgraceful journalists if u are implicated in the Commission it doesn't mean u can't Cross-examine someone without testifying. Pravin private ideas not to be cross examined by tom is in direct conflict with public opinion that evidence can be strengthen by being cross examined They propagated take news which the EFF believe Listen to the messiah

"When Gordhan headed up SARS there were maximum tax collection the indian mafia must fall ANC IS RACIST MORE THAN EFF Parliament to out of due to useless ministers within ANC pointed by president even though Tax is increased up to 15% {monitors} LOL Moyane is a liar some very slanderous and outrageous comments by trolls .

1:18:37,1:20:47, Parliament to out of cash due to useless ministers within ANC pointed by president even though Tax is increased up to 15% {monitors} @mbuso sibisi​ANC IS RACIST MORE THAN EFF -tjoooo omaka ngwana batho @mbuso sibisi Stop accusing the ANC of racism and deal with your EFF.

1:21:51,1:23:22, Anyone watching Monyani reactions in the righthand corner of the vid? The ANC led the process of putting together the Freedom Charter that was launched in 1955. That Charter says South Africa belongs to all who live in it black and white. @Spha Nkosi ...ALL the Mafia must fall...Bra Shame all these bitter poor people in the comments defending Tommy Boy Moyane just because he is black . singi they dont love you either no matter how hard you can try to impress them "None Thulani Why should people be making such an effort to avoid cross examination. If you are telling the truth you should welcome any cross examination so as to get an opportunity to tell that truth again. malema's hatred for Gordan dates back to one point in polokwane "@Spha Nkosi wrong. a battle was won 
1:23:43,1:25:09, The EFF's defence of Moyane is unprincipled The Le Roux character is waffling moyane is corrupt finish and klaar Malema: Old COSATU was original compare with this COSATU that was romanticized Zuma "Law is not about opinions or hate for someone @Bubele Vakalisa mhmmmm @Bubele Vakalisa.. How doe one waffle logic and fact? Moyane is corrupt. Gordhan is as corrupt if not worse He can be here Thando. I can go there too if I want to. 
1:25:13,1:25:57, @Myka'Al Daud I agree This woman is weak @Bubele Vakalisa probably not The EFF has got to a point of fighting the battle of Zuma and acolytes. "Monyane should go home and retire in peace...he is wasting public money and time of the Commission Prain threw mud without evidence. Let it be tested @bubele it is so obvious that if you here something that discredit your opinion you go on caracter assasination Pravin is dizzy together with his white lawyers "agreed

Only the matter you are disputing. what's this about. I just landed on it online this advocate know her stuff...and shes respectful @YinYan it is this type of argument that weakens the course for the advancement of women.

Nobody will employ this man .

How can you waste anybodies time with this boy thing. Some people are emotionally adult and some emotionally childish. Eish!tea girl? Malema puppet stuff 
1:47:15,1:47:51, @Thando Nkutha Ufuna ukukhuluma yedwa? Ngeke ayibone loonto. Clearly we saw how one of the lead singers of this commission Vytjie Mantoor sang a different tune under re-examination. Akabuzwe! So the EFF's allegation of racism against Gordan emanates from Moyane. Askis bagayetso. I retract my comment "How do u become SC if u just blow hot air @Philani Madlala .....now...now... Bra.....don't be a naughty Boy... @joseph makofane i agree with you. this is the reason why he failed to give the chair a chance speak Gordon must fall ALL THE LOOTING BY ANC Monyane has put his foot in his mouth..... now all we can hope for is if he now shoots himself in the foot 😃 
1:48:02,1:49:15, He must sit down now. 10 min is finished akunankinga @Philani Madlala mfethu Moyane is a boy LOL "This is not a court right Tommy Boy Moyane Dali...This is a STATE CAPTURE commission...take ur case to Mozam "Uyabhuda uMpofu It was nice when they where eating our money. Now they come running here and dont want to tell us why they ate our money. but dali is overboard 
1:49:26,1:50:35, @Philani Madlala She is not white she is a cheap afrikaaner "wonder if you can name cases 😂😂😂 Personal vendettas between Moyane and Pravin are irrelevant to the Commission. Just asking for more airtime to watch this EFF man. Waste of time. what's so special about Pravin. Sorry people I hate that old man "Best characterisation of Gordhan attitude towards the commission by Mpofu DALi is making him special @Musa Bakiti ....Eeeesh Bra....you really have chips on both shoulders...Ne.. Relax mr Mpofu we have proof 
1:50:36,1:52:22, "In all fairness "unfortunately mr Mpofu the easiest thing is let your client take the stand DALI LOSE AGAIN hey learn to listen dali. a ku na mubvana kwalaho Dali Mpofu is useless. He lost majority of his eff and Monaye cases. @Joel Mzayidume i Have all Indians and afrikaaners not forgetting Chinese I would think that anything that was said in the commission can be cross examined. "HAHAHA Mpofu very emotional  Moyane make himself popular 
1:52:27,1:54:50, Yhoooooo! saze savelelwa nguMpofu. Banyisa umlungu😂😂😂ka Paraffin Mpofu is on the offensive now Pretorious is right PG doesn't want his version tested @Thando Nkutha ...u have 2 ears and 1 mouth...Listen first then speak you must be blind if you not see that this WHITE vs BLACK @Thando Nkutha he's the evidence leader. it's his job. he isn't taking sides "This man should have recused himself long time ago when comes to anything involved Gordhan

Their anger towards whites / Indians / coloureds make them support corrupt individuals . "It is not a court as I said "Mpofu is not the best talker. I'd go on to say he is one of the worst. Hence it becomes important to listen to what he says Ngithe hlukana nathi nge ANC yakho @Phumlani Ranyana The chair can limit cross examination to only what was said here.

Seems like i'm going to enjoy this sitting of today. probably thought its a new brand of biscuits zumas ungasi Are our ANC MPs so switched off that they don't read the news?

"President Zuma was never impeached "Zuma controlled all aspects of government he would have had enough time to delete/shred evidence.Dudu Myeni @ SAA maleka is the best. he has listening skills and is very patient unlike dali no one has evidence on the Guptas... but yey Agrizzi is coming... I don't know with what next week😂😂😂 "You cannot compare Mpofu and Ngcukayithobi with Maleka. At least Ngcukayithobi is still young he can match him in future

YEBO 
2:56:23,2:58:36, I wish the would be another Agrizzi from STEINHOFF AND KPMG 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Maleka represented Malema(CIC) not Eff. and REMGRO Here we go!!...Total memory loss!!??

Morning Mike Lock anything important mentioned? Wellcome Adv Maleke The administrator should block conversations about political parties and race issues on this chat group. No place for it here.

3:11:40,3:14:02, Out of here when is the ZUMAS and their cabal coming to this commission. Do lawyers study accounting too? adv. Maleka is a genius liar... Glencore exported for more money... eskom has nothing to do with that... eskom has a fixed rate for all mines . you not special 😡 He sure is sharp 👍🏻 "@Lesedi  thabiso you know nothing about ZUMA... media lied to you Maleka is a big gun. I suddenly can't compare him to Mpofu This is boring. Let me go back to GUPTA project😂😂. Ndakuva ngani. I cant dzeal with chartered accountants. It is too much for my understanding. Nindibize xa kuthethwa ngamasela. 
3:14:04,3:17:22, "सोच समझकर वोट देना लोकसभा चुनाव में साहब @Ntombethemba Manase Its going downhill "@Santo Ka Khazana - Swami Sharnanandji  "Mpofu and ngcukaithobi is small boys to Maleka "i tend to agree with you "He is very sharp & eloquent "Even if the media lied to me @Frik Brits Is that @Santo Ka Khazana - Swami Sharnanandji Hindi? My laptop at times does that and I tend to take in for repairs. Now I know who to ask to tell me what the message is. witness lying again... Glencore wanted a higher rate for your coal because they lost business abroad 
3:17:56,3:20:48, @Mpho Mashigo are you serious he's lying? They do have a basic accounting course ... even those that do not do Commercial/Corporate Law as a major "Prime Minister Gordan is trying to duck and dive "@Norman Zwane The message was : ""Vote in the Lok Sabha elections Have you ever heard about Mpofu and Ngcukaitobi b4? They were popular in marikana and land redistribution Joel... Koko spilled the beans on Glencore...on Eskom enquiry #Sandile. Prime Minister? They must just thank Eff they were fully deployed by the party "@Norman Zwane  
3:20:56,3:25:19, suspended obligations means breaching eskom contract by not supplying coal... creating a load shedding crisis to get your way nja😡😡😡 "@Joel Mzayidume @Frik Brits So what to do when my lap top flashes such messages (aka a Whiter shade of pale) - knowing the words but cannot make meaning of them - dash for the door or celebrate return of the land? ok @Eslon Eslon I won't @Frik Brits Linux? Ok! "@Norman Zwane  @Eslon Eslon When Maleka wanted to cross Manyi; suddenly Manyi was like a boxer holding onto an opponent for dear life. I found it humorous. I think Pravin feared the same from Mpofu. "@Norman Zwane  @Frik Brits You not selling me something neh? 
3:25:35,3:31:04, WMC corrupt thugs must be exposed "@Norman Zwane  @Norman Zwane Pravin will hold his own against Mpofu since he has nothing to hide. It's all just a matter of principle I would realy like to see Pravin Gordhan here it's amazing how people speak on behalf others with surity as well🙄 @Frik Brits it would be interesting. But I understand if he doesn't want Moyane calling the shots This is the first time a business rescue practitioner testifies. Can we for next 15 minutes listen and comment on what this witness says? exactly that's how business works... honour your contractual agreement... PRAVIN GORDHAN IS A FRAUD!! 
3:31:40,3:35:41, It's sad to see all these CA members implicated in Fraud in the private and the Civil sectors. The CA's also involved in the disgraced auditing industry is very disturbing!! @Trucker do you have evidence Gordhan is a fraud? "Mpofu was not going to respond to wat was on the table @Joel Mzayidume DID THE FRAUDULENT PRAVIN GORDHAN PRESENT ANY EVIDENCE WHEN HE SPENT THREE DAYS AT THIS COMMISSION? DON'T ASK SILLY QUESTIONS. @Trucker are you still here? Ok i missed his evidence. "@Joel Mzayidume You missed ""his evidence"" what evidence is this?" "Mpofu is a chairman of Eff which have fights with him. Now coming here to present moyane which he carries two conflicts i meant his 3-day testimony 
3:35:49,3:41:46, @makhosi nobhatyi Mpofu is a lawyer doing his job. "@Norman Zwane @Joel Mzayidume LOL what a joker. @Eslon Eslon half lawyer that's been winning a lot of cases. the truth is coming out... 😁 Skellembosch must fall with all these testimonies and evidence provided....what and when will any action be taken against the criminals @Myka'Al Daud ...SkellemLathuli.....must fall.....i reckon Dali Mpofu want to use the commission to discredit Pravin bcos of the eff political agenda against him. 
3:42:50,3:50:21, Google Glencore and what it has done in the DRC same story... these people are international criminals 😡 "This is not the first inquiry we heard in this country @Saider Sai Selebi chose bad friends - Angelotti turned state witness against Selebi and so he wasn't prosecuted. "Eslon u accept ppl must come there n discredit other politicians bcos of factional battle Mpofu is a qualified professional. The commission wouldnt let him participate in this if there is conflict of interest. "Malema only hates Pravin bcos he was commissioner when they took his farms What is Pravin running from? "@Trucker I understand he is a lawyer but a politician I m happy that chair will consider facts n not innuedos spread by media
