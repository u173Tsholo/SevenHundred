Treating the witness with kid gloves. He cannot get a straight answer from Zuma. Never heard such cross - examining. What next?

Zuma can remember things took place over 29 years ago and reported them in details here yesterday but can’t remember things happen 5 or 7 or 8 years ago. 
57:41,57:48, These lawyers aint taking crab.... Thabani balande! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 The commision must give us questions as to where is Zuma done corruption WHY IS ZONDO SCARED OF ZUMA'S COUNSIL ZONDO DISCIPLINE YOUR EVIDENCE LEADER!!

58:00,58:15, Attacking Pretorious is a strategy to obfuscate Terms of reference!!!! Exacly Sounds like he's lying. sharp lawyer 👌👌 remove zondo "Ut if he does not remember anything who is threatening the president zuma remembering a person or an event is different from remembering a phone call "Ooops here it comes 
58:16,58:28, this hearing is a farse Then it is a total wast of time. I AM SURE KNOW1 ON THIS BIG HEADS TEAM HAS NO RELEVANT EDUCATIONAL BACKROUND I was also thinking that they are now oncross examination There is no other way Zuma can be questioned than the current method & that's not cross exam. But he does remember what happened in 1990’s who was spy lots of oppenheimer and ruppert slaves on here losing respect for zondo now why Zuma shall respond to the moves of the ministry while he was the president? 
58:30,58:50, his memory is great when playing the victim why is everything about black Pity Chabane is now deseased White Regime Zuma lawyers are very sharp...and they're on point "I'm begging to doubt our ZONDO now lets be loyal to terms and reference💪 Hierdie hulp wat Zuma saamgebring het is onaanvaarbaar. Hy is die oorsaak van die gemors in hierdie land. 🤣 
58:50,59:12, I think Zuma must back to his wives abd hus kraal at Nkandla...we kniw what he did "My leader you are just doing well Sir this white laywer is pushing an suspicious agenda pretorious must ask relevant questions and lead properly 5 words per minute This is a waste of time Akasakhumbuli manje yini inkinga yenu aniyeke uZuma phansi nina Zinja mnxn This commission is a dangerous exercise in general. It is actually victory to those that wish to control the state "rubbish 
59:18,59:30, @ Mariki I agree....whats the point in going on if hes just going say he doesnt remember anything and continue with his denial im sure zuma he is feeling happy in his heart 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ They must call this minister to verify Maseko's statement why one shall be blamed for remembering or not remembering? do they talk like this in the hopes that the other will fall asleep Zulu uyesabeka! @rampolful Remove racists. The lawyer has a point but he what is really doing is to paint zuma as the victim where as he is a perpetrator. one of you give me a date of any 3 calls you heard last month and the details of any calls content. 
59:35,59:50, this capture thing should go to court now... "Zuma's lawyer has a point.. indeed in terms of reference.. 1st test whether the affidavit implicates regarding fraud The commission is captured Selective amnesia Hello I’m divine mbuduma this was a call to fire a dg and he can't remember People don't really don't like uMsholozi.. But Zuma remembered thinks that happen in the 1990's "So strange
