Makes one wonder how many paid-up members there are in the ANC!! @David Tuer 😎😎😎😂😂😂 "@Norman Zwane yOU also believe it is the suicide? Hm @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Any guy who has no access to at least R30000 in cash in his immediate rich is deceiving himself if he thinks he is in the ANC.

1:42:13,1:43:30, Hi phapha zuma👍 she is here for real business 😂 "@Gee Peex1 the former applies here however i wish all the witnesses to be cross examine that is my wish India is over crowded there is no space She will do justice to the country if she can handle Ace when he appears at the commission. but even if Hofmeyer does a brilliant job..how sure are we that anyone will be arrested and jailed???? in the commision it is leading witness no cros examination now only when legal object about any qeustions he migh say this is cros ex Henry Mayambu I agree with you

It's their turn to eat. @Spykerhond go outside sniff around for a place and have a nice crap scratch it with your hind legs and come back as a sane person "the bantus didn't have the knowledge on how to build the country 
2:32:00,2:33:11, EAT? @Norman Zwane are you a tax payer? SABC for all purposes are definatly bankrupt sabc is destroyed by the bantu management skills @rosalind gerber Sadly yes I am.

R100MIL down and the only arrests made was for racism iyho our country was sold for soup here and this guy is talking junk lol He has reached the dead end of his lies. Now he has resorted to anger to get out of the hook. But it is too late. The witness is an accountant by qualification. I hope the auditing firm he worked in are busy reviewing the dudes 'working papers'. This is a 'nearly balanced' accountant. The witness has his team of lawyers to prepare him @Gee Peex1 no white 
2:37:44,2:40:05, He will cry this one Hmmm Mr Natasen? Hayikhona He still has the loot he got from the state @Gee Peex1 i like this advocate her questioning is superb and fishing information out of the guy Is this gentleman coming for the second time? Or is just look alike. tsotsi maan he knows that is government money.... he might pull a zuma here and run away RUN BALDY RUN lol he is coming second time lol I wonder if is necessary to do name calling and drag race on every discussion.
