5:51,7:54, service it's poor today 🔫🔫 @Valencia you have earned the day off lol Its pretty slack that you can spend millions on the commision and lawyers and cant get a decent microphone set up on the witness. Do they send someone to the witnes to ensure they are set up properly? who is MAAKWANAZI? bad sound🙄 On my laptop I can open 2 tabs and I pop out the chat @Valencia J @Douglas Masuku Board Chair @Douglas Masuku Former Board Chairperson at Transnet He looks like an angel on a cloud-morning all

TY. I do worry! The witness doesn't look ill or incapacitated. why's he testifying via crappy video link? Sounds like Barbara Hogan got superceded early by Gigaba who came into Transnet and throwing his weight around "@Pastor J.J Thanks @Sherwin Peters is over 60 yrs this madala 
16:42,21:02, "@Sherwin Peters @Heather Durr Just got a Whatsapp response. They dont see you there but will check with the guys next door....What di you do wrong Dear Heather? sound and picture very bad My head is too sore to remember 💀💀 Picture of the witness left much to be desired Any shots fired in SENEKAL Maybe also trying to avoid the DCJ's upcoming questions face to face @SABC PLEASE FIX BAD SOUND ENGINEERING ON ZOOM CALLS. FIX YOUR LEVELS Hope you confess as much as you are reading 
22:32,25:05, SABC Please let this madala move out of the sunlight as we cannot see his face Dear All I am 3 months off 60 but still feel 16 so no jokes about old folks please except where strictly necessary-Must I leave the Group now as I am too old😭 SABC Quality of sound picture are as result of non payments of TV licences to SABC!!! @Heather Durr I beat you hands down😂😂😂 I this guy trying to legitimise Mr Gama getting his job back? hello "Heather @Tommygun not only that but the contract Gama signed for 80mil to his friend Nyanda hello and bye cause SABC is showing us Nigerian movies on Zond Com

We need your wisdom amongst us. Is he the guy who suggested condonations in the first place ? @Lennon Marks Awww I still think I am 16.But sweet not so much.. "Heather Typical SABC - instead of tapping directly into the zoom feed (or pc) prefer to put the camera on to the projection screen and a mic at the speakers. Amateurs @Tommygun condonation was only asked about 2 months after litigation. They needed explanation as to what condonation is 
26:43,30:03, yes @Tommygun - he was pivotal in the whole debacle another mamphara this one "@SanFran Arnold Oh ja @Tommygun always a pleasure @Shane Ambrosio 😂😂😂 Why are you killing me so early in the morning 🤣🤣 lol it's awful when you look in the mirror and wonder who the old woman looking back at you is @Pheladi Lamola You are too kind. Thank you. @Jenny Whitewaves I always pretended that was my mother who looks just like me until my psychiatrist changed my Bi-Polar meds 
30:40,32:37, @Heather Durr 😅😅😅 thats classic I wonder how he will explain ignoring all legal advice he was given contradicting what the board actualy did. why discipline if you condone? When your kids are grey is when you realise that you're getting on a bit! "Girls you are funny This mampara is already hiding? billions? @Lynn Barnard hello @Heather Durr you are hilarious par excellence

Only the one coould possibly have been affected by the condonation @Tommygun correct was Gama there with Ramos? You’re correct @Tommy... "Looks like he's excuse is just gonna be 
42:07,45:06, "According to yesterday’s testimony "Montana vows to reveal all about Prasa at state capture inquiry I remember msholozi say a ngisabe ejele ngeboya no 12 years manje seoya lesaba manje:yt: This Mkhwanazi...

"@SanFran Arnold - Zuma doesn’t need to worry about Attending the Zondo Commission next month Stupid Board🙈 "Exactly  
1:01:06,1:02:40, Along with the entire Transnet Board.... in a nut shell all these boards are useless. @R.m. B. I am holding out for that day @keeran kerar Mkwanazi is on Skype and they were testing this from 09h00 until the live stream started at 10 and couldn't get it right. The requirements to become a board member on any of these SOE's are very low "Nxa Yep they should at least have a qualification the people who run this country are a waste "@Khanyi. AgeGracefully to an extent for proper governance 
1:02:47,1:04:17, lol comes from a view what a waste 🙄🙄🙄 "Yes Adv. Myburgh thank u Mkwanazi "This guy is falling..... telling a story on its own No “maybe” about it... @thando nicky He lost his thoughts long time ago🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 he can just tell the truth he had no powers it was an instruction 
1:04:26,1:05:22, adv myburgh😂😂😂 "eh Cardboard and Surfboards are more useful and effective than any of the SOE Boards. What a waste So this commission is supposed to be finished end December? So basically he is saying because no on else complained about the process i saw no need to complain. 🤣🤣🤣 @Mbuso Ndlovu 😂😂😂 It should never end... We will actually save money for the fiscus Mr MaKhwanazi🤣🤣🤣 
1:05:33,1:06:35, @Natalie Soine March 2021 the end This man sees that things are wrong...but he says it was correct at the time that they dealt with it😀😀 "22 others that could have done something similar??????? Your excuse dies here papa "We need to “fact-check” all Government employees so-called qualifications to hold office true Sanfran B. Pass the buck all day long im losing my thoughts 🤣🤣🤣 true 
1:06:42,1:07:25, Heaven help us with all this looting at Transnet and others @R.m. B. fully agree!!!!!!!! 😅😂 "@ adv Todd @Russia Magezi He'll say his data ran out 😉 @Khanyi. AgeGracefully Are you related to Khanyi Mbawu?? I love it when Adv Myburgh starts shouting:elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: only... both of them shout when they hear no sense on responses 
1:07:29,1:08:10, Professionals should not allow themselves to be compromised in this way. Now an intelligent and experienced executive is not making sense. Myburg is my Hero @simon kubeka If there are network issues they shoul bring hi in person same time🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Junior staff always fired I want to find the storeroom with all the white paint and red noses. It must be huge and worth a fortune because somebody must have been keeping these clowns well equipped. "Adv Myburgh arrested soon Say that again Diana👍 @Mzalwane Mzala he brought it on himself 
1:08:15,1:09:27, These guys are all sounding confused How about Adv Seleka? Its hot inconsitan......what ?😂😂😂😅😅 🤭 "@Mzalwane Mzala they brilliant thugs Samuel....dont forget Mr Pretorius Line of thinking??????????????? you asked Brian???? really unbelievable

1:10:14,1:10:57, there are too many people who are getting away with murder depending who they are this man is shaking now @Granny Mokwena Adv Gcabashe? Condonation is a defence argument made when an accuser has previously chosen to ignore an act about which they are now legally complaining. It may prevent the accuser from prevailing. @SanFran Arnold helo skattie. Hi everyone.this guy his lost in the mist. Inject them all with truth serum This advocate is an expert Oi Mr Myburgh is getting warm 
1:11:13,1:12:25, When DCJ comes back on he gets much more calm again lol He is getting dizzy now. "@Anne M it could be Would’ve been very costly for Transnet to dismiss 22 managers "This guy should just come out with the truth Adv Myburgh SC is a master at exposing contradictions stuttering Kate Hofmeyr @Masivuye if there is grounds not costly at all 
1:12:33,1:13:21, Advocate Kate Hofmeyr DCJ is on fire I would be furious too. @Zondo has every reason. ubaba lo will end up blaming someone and not accept his role in the frucus that is before us. he says we felt condonation was a fair judgment @Masivuye Peanuts...according to Vinette Klein! "Yes Can this guy ask for a comfort break... Where is this bastaad testifies from?????????????????????? MyBurgh is very brilliant. @Masivuye how so when people are found quilty of misconduct? 
1:13:22,1:14:04, stepk @melds melds he scared Mr Zuma and Gigaba Jail? @Mduduzi Thabede Too late!! DCJ I dont understand too What this board did cannot be justified why this crook have thick lips are you guys noticed that pls I wonder "zero accountability 😂😂😂@wim... 
1:14:06,1:14:49, "Gross (deliberate) negligence is grounds for instant dismissal DCJ is not supposed to attack so much settlement Evidence leader has more leeway to do that @Owen Nyilika he would become a national hero if he did DCJ for CJ position "it looks like he is recovering from stroke. Corruption can kill you flabbergasted! I comment the entire commission hats off to them. we need upright people. @Zondo for greater heights. SALUTE 
1:15:06,1:16:31, @BanditZA Zondo may be bais This Comission is worth every cent stepk "Can the DCJ ask a last question  "Yes @Mbuso Ndlovu Bias???? you cannot be seriou "DCJ is on form "😠😠😠 No need to speculate on what did not happen? he knew that he could apply for condonation. Why then the what if??? 
1:16:31,1:17:06, I understand why Zuma doesn't want to come. DCJ is sharp The subtitles.....condonation becomes condemnation...and now condensation😀 @Mbuso Ndlovu Deputy Chief Justice RMM Zondo is not biased! Please listen to the evidence yourself and come to logical conclusions! That’s why we are here! DCJ is voicing the logical conclusions! @BanditZA Better than Netflix... for free! "Maxwell @melds melds that corruption in Transnet was a White Collar Crime brur all they get money there Who should be the evidence leader with Zuma it's not necessarily DCj for Cj he is doing his job. @wim louw agreed real life emotion and drama — the truth finally! 
1:17:10,1:17:47, @Mduduzi Thabede - Zuma and the Guptas. @grannymokwena all 22 of them charged with the same misconduct @heather i think they should all do him same time 😆 @Heather Durr Adv. Pretorious is the evidence leader Heather.....its always Pretorius with Zuma @BanditZA Zondo is enjoying this🤣🤣 But it’s board who reinstated him...@nkosingiphile... "karma - what goes around @Heather Durr Got to be Paul P!! 
1:18:03,1:18:49, this was a spineless board "@Owen Nyilika I get that DCJ how could the board restated him @SanFran Arnold yeah. Myburgh SC is filling up his petrol tank.😜 @ Ndlovu Kangaroo Board "@SanFran Arnold He probable was carrying board instructions Gama was the Guptas golden boy 
1:19:08,1:20:33, Mr Mkwanazi help the DCJ to understand uBaba Mkhwanazi mustn't complicates himself!!! Somebody had a final say in those resolutions. "External factors not easy to convince Zondo "@Paul Buchel gm "I’m throwing in the towel "we cannot keep putting all the blame on the Guptas @SanFran Arnold Hah that will be fun. @wim louw Pretorius will send us all to sleep @Kieron Sinewave Maybe each one will do their own stream "@SanFran Arnold​ 
1:20:40,1:21:11, Mr Mkwanazi tell DCJ that instruction came outside the board the DCJ will rest the line of questioning what are the 2005 cases? "Me fired? Wait until I tell everyone what the Board has been doing....Ok The ANC cabal fought for this country they are entitled to what they want the chief in command showed them the way. @melds melds agreed all soedistroyed by anc "bubbling He must stop this condonation justification now. during the Zuma wasted years the board members in every seos where capture to perform dirty work. 
1:21:32,1:23:15, And so what DCJ "@Mark Page the other cases are a straw man — a diversion. It doesn’t really bear on this matter 'In fairness to you DCJ' this guy makes DCJ angry////// @Heather Durr LOL 😂 DCJ is spitting fire today "corruption started years before Zuma Mr Zondo is cross today We may need blood pressure meds this side for DCJ 
1:23:20,1:24:05, take everything we fought for it money tenders ours. the illogicality is infuriating Zondo "He didnt apply "Mr Mkhwanazi we are tired of your lies mkwanazi police have found machine guns in the white one bakkie in senekal at road block this morning Mr. Mkhwanazi is not concerned about making sense today. "DCJ thats what im talking about. "" So what""?:elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough:" as a chair mr mkhanazi 
1:24:11,1:24:58, Chair it is dodgy to the core. Could only have been orchestrated😑😑 "Let’s deal with the other charges now Someone lost out on the tender for wheels not ;delivered but invoiced for. So they needed a puppet CEO Gama was the guy. This was a means to steal money while achieving a means to continue stealing "Mr Mkwanazi stop with this condonation... it does not make sense now Those abusive witnesses waffle on and on and just waste all our time some nice hot tea Boere v EFF just now.... Dankie mos chair shower time 
1:24:58,1:25:42, Myburhg Music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! wat is con donation ak47 adjourned 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Who loves tea more than Chair.? scam And SO WHAT🙄 "Please

If I was in his position I would have said as the board we made a serious error while many* That money is long gone they must all just go to jail Yeah admitting guilt and telling us why you did it is better more leniency later 
1:27:36,1:28:10, corruption is brutal z "And it's not they they had stolen a few thoudands @finalcutish - ​Condonation is a defence argument made when an accuser has previously chosen to ignore an act about which they are now legally complaining. It may prevent the accuser from prevailing. @finalcutish means forgive and forget when th money was fresh Billions!!! but trust me they will be caught out its a game SIU will need to recoup the little that they have back into the state coffers that they looted Yes billions 
1:28:11,1:29:12, let's hope he comes back🤣 I hope you are right "There’s no serious error here We must support Hawks and NPA they are trying cool "@finalcutish A exc has signing power up to agiven amount of money Zuma's mandate "Just imagine that @Mduduzi Thabede - Zuma and the Guptas. 
1:29:42,1:31:03, Jenny it’s worse than that because condonation happens after it is signed. If it is done your way there’s no misconduct "You see these african politicians dont care about the rest of the poverty stiken african people thx v m Condonation I condon or acept as reasonable what you have done although you exceeded your auth stricken* "@H A L O that is the truth yes "When someone comes from grass-roots "to recoup that money they must sell everything belongs to this looters including their flies 😂😂But it must come from Mr Mkhwanazi @R.m.B 
1:31:12,1:32:38, cant be spelt con donation jenny We must sell their children also 😂 serious spelt like that Jokes!!!! @BanditZA agreed ok this mampara has no answer to your question DCJ "It would have been a different story if they looted the billions to help the poor Their children and children of their children should be bonded for 10 generations to the state or until the money is repaid with interest. The deal should be so bad they decide not to reproduce... 
1:32:42,1:33:57, what is thid man's alledged sin to society? ...and thus exit the gene pool @R.m. B. - not always true. DCJ comes from humble beginnings in life but has not abandoned integrity and compassion for others corruption u will be caught and at government level they know that and still they dont care This way corrupters will never produce corrupt children and teach they their corrupt ways (All this tongue in cheek) Did yourll see the pictures of one of the looters sons? They posted pictures if themselves holding stacks of cash and showing if their expensive cars of* this executives need proper life style audit conducted by this commission i think its where we can find closure

B His lawyers are busy fidgeting behind the scenes Are you unaware of what is happening between eff and white farmers? "ever seen the dismal conditions farm workers work in The burning of state property took place in the absence of the EFF EFF and Afri-forum members do not deserve our attention. @Roza essack I was thinking the same. It is disgusting the double standards in the land.

Full stop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you condemn EFF and praise Afriforum that tells me a lot about you 
2:43:23,2:44:02, """Now you can add another paragraph in your supplementary affidavit"" 😂🤣 Advocate Myburgh" Focus focus Have we even spoken about the other 3 charges against Gama or still on the first tender irregularity The fact is that calling this country a rainbow nation is all just for show. This country still has too much racism. Deep down inside many know they are racists even if they don't show it. His lawyer is sitting next to him... @Roza essack You've got his size orange suite in stock? @Yolo More 😅😅😅 Connie just telling the truth. "Gigaaaba GAAAMA RAMA

2:46:23,2:47:19, "Imagine what businesses and employment could have been done with all the state ""STOLEN"" resources.....all want a better life......" I just remembered how shameless Gigaba was during the Gupta leaks🙆🏾‍♀️ heh heh this lawyer @johannes mailula - it's rule by fear. "The ANC is corrupt @Ndlovu are u making jokes J D you right they need cooked blood ( bobete) "relax people @Diana Sekatane if not all of them. ANC is just a gang of thugs.

2:51:56,2:53:37, @SanFran Arnold "@Bavuyile if we talk about apartheid the rest of our lives then we give next generation excuse not to account for their live. Im finally here. Exhausted from all the Senekal coverage 🙂 🤔🤔🤔🤔Mkwanazi Mmmm....Zuma must be lucky that people are protecting him so much @Joe you are very correct because our history in Africa is really horrible. this man is a lightweight @johannes mailula totally agreed 
2:53:49,2:55:12, Zuma would rather die before he comes to the commission - what a total coward HOW CAN U PROTECT A THIEF A woman scorned perhaps question the ex wives of the ministers. I would imagine there would be abundance of info...... Im sure they are getting paid for protecting him "@Eric Dom @Sithembiso Nyawo I think its maybe dirty money that caused power for him cause if he gets zuma in trouble zuma will prob get people on him @Cynthia Key I like your thinking 😆 Their are to many puppets out there....how are these people employed.......so much of these State Capture witnesses should never have taken place had the correct employment and screening taken place.. J B maybe he will go hire uno fire to fake his death 
2:55:32,2:57:03, thats true all must get their price its waiting for them Rocks and bottles fly in Senekal amidst tense stand-off between EFF supporters and farmers (Timeslive) i could make an ai laugh i tone it down to a 3 in chat "@Jacqui Baumgardt "@Sthembiso @Eric Dom a thief steals The chief in command repossessed the money and the Guptas the formed Zuptas in Dubai. @Mzala this is not necessary. "it's like he is so brainwashed hasn't he? - more or less @Xolani J Masemula 
2:57:40,2:59:08, loool we laugh but the money they took this country is not poor @Paul Buchel - I'm not holding out any hopes @Diana Sekatane What is not necessary? "@GB reluctantly though The idea that cadres be used to run SOEs whilst having little or no business experience ever is laughable. Most directors lives have been spent in politics and relying on the public purse. Does anyone know of a live stream about what's happening in senekal? @Mzala I mean the fighting. This guy looks funny Is there any chairman of an SOE who stood up to Zuma's illegal encroachment? 
2:59:39,3:00:28, Supplementary affidavit is an excuse @TW Ntshingila kind of and they were removed.... I had my fingers crossed when I said that! Many of these people are unable to stand up against the then Number 1. lie__eerrrrr @TW Ntshingila not one that stayed on the board for long @TW Ntshingila Zuma is no engel These ppl are liars....yoh @Infinite try big daddy 
3:00:31,3:01:36, they interview one protester who does not know why he is there at first place he utter nonsensical facts what was the position of this madala at transnet? @Diana Sekatane I agree it is not necessary and there are two sides to it. he lied so much it was hard for him to sit straight Chair of the board Oscar @Oscar Mautso Board Chair @Person of interest Big daddys up there looking for fish in a barrel...of which there are many @Person of interest thank you "@Tommygun all of them seem to be ""yes "" men hence I wonder about their achievements before being appointed to head SOEs. They all seemed to be incompetent"
