1:37:35,1:40:47, "@Norman Zwane we are expecting Batohi to prosecute them "chair reminds me of my late great grandmother Ms September if she was black would be a very beautiful girl.

Is she leading the evidence for the first time or what? September is septembering us hey!! but she should learn shame DCJ has been irritable since she started leading this evidence. "Commission is exposing all executives who put head into investigation and manipulation of information to demonize public

1:58:00,2:04:55, "After elections you will see more evidence about Zuma‚Äôs panic and respond to the allegations was risen @Michael Wild that s not surprise because he is a legal person and is within the legal ethics.. And the ANC politicians allowed themselves to be used to cover and protect all the crooks and looters of state resources Remember these individuals are not anc employed by government kay kay ANC is corrupt So Richard Mdluli pledge to cover Jacob Zuma's back? "So tell me something people "Anc is not individuals "@Sthakathi Khumalo If they want to clear their names. If they don't testify here 
2:04:59,2:08:22, Anc is corrupt not individual the in tire organization @douglas gwambe Too true. The ANC has corrupted all levels of government - from parliament to ward councillors and everything in between. Corrupt to the core. Remember Jiba was already facing charges that were dropped by Shaun Abrahams on the day she was meant to appear in court corruption is a way of life in the ANC he he he he chickens have come back to roost. "Derek Main Thanks bro!! Eish Derek main 88% of corruption is from AFRICAN NATIONAL CORRUPTION. "Zuma influenced and corrupted majority of the ANC leaders @Od Mod I think they kick you out if you are NOT corrupt. 
2:09:24,2:14:18, Wonder what the polls will demonstrate next week @Sthakathi Khumalo Let her try - then they can grill her. @douglas gwambe I agree 100% Sello Maema not Sello Malema ANC - The Poephol's Choice Now I understand why the ANC Zuma faction didn't want CR to be come president and have decided to plan for his removal @Kay Kay Scary stuff I tell you @makhosi nobhatyi They will be torn apart if they do.

She is waiting for parliament to debate her removal. what is going on? @Kay Kay Can you imagine how she must sh*tting bricks right now for that 'little' lie.? Kay Kay she criticised the report saying Mokgoro made elementary mistakes & requests Cyril to redeploy her to another state institution Ramaphosa stated that Jiba could not be given any public service job. There is one she can get. sweeping the floors in Jail. state pay and all. but behind bars. khoisan.land
