6:57,10:04, "@noko No one a thing is that you are not looking at fact but evidence that tie ZUMA. How? They will just show some bank statements nje. Im telling you it wont go anywhere. No one will be arrested or charged. Its a just a show to garner votes for 2019 elections remember it part of white monopoly it have too say more wrong things Its a network of transactions that will implicate the banks themselves. There are vested interests to protect the real perpetrators of state capture which is white monopoly capital ZWANE@ DOES IT MATTER WHO GIVE THE EVIDENCE OR THE FACTS IN THE EVIDENCE. @mr moyo I agree no one will face jail Guptas are just small fish whom they want to throw under the bus. Which will not happen. This is just Generations or Uzalo with a well written script. They are all actors Mr Moyo T... kindly explain what is white monopoly capital 
10:15,13:32, 5 Minutes into the broadcast and the race card starts.... so sad... Jonathan you know very well what that is. @Jonathan Palivili WMC is whatever Bell Pottinger told them it was. "I dont know.. @makofane it does matter .wait til Duduzani come South Africa has always been about race. Don't come here and act DUMB. @Siyabonga Nxumalo now the whole world is about race. From Europe to America to SA to S. America @Jones race will always matter till the world ends if it will People dont yet realize that Guptas are being all used to cover up the real mess behind the rot in govt. 
13:34,17:19, All the big white owned firms have done much worse than what this fake commission is trying to fool us into believing Its all about race NOW ??/... so im bit confused as to how white monopoly capital affected the closing up the Gupta related accounts jonathan look at the bigger picture Closing of accounts is just a front or a ruse Yes thats what you need to explain .. you are answering in riddles ? @Jonathan white monopoly owns banks "even if that is so  The Banks are public listed companies... go and invest your black money in them and then you can own them Did you guys know that the majority of the global wealth is owned buy 5 families. 
17:42,20:25, "Please note Mr Moyo that the banks have not closed any other companies accounts  Systematized racism is half indoctrination and it is difficult to undo indoctrination. Economic endeavors knows no race. jonathan why just focus on guptas and not other white companies as well if this inquiry can quantify the money got by India family and white monopoly through state capture you real see paradigm shift from hating this India to white monopoly MR Moyo its because of NO OTHER companies robbing our SOEs and our hard earned tax moneys and did not know how to account for the stolen money look how they play victim and point fingers to zuma and his indian cronies. the commision is just a farce until it addresses the real state capture @MrMoyoT ....and I'm afraid to say you are very doff Jonathan you act naive @MrMoyoT That's true Sir. 
20:31,24:50, Robert how so You think this kangaroo commission will achieve anything More of our money down the drain Mr Moyo @MrMoyoT What is state capture? Who is captured? Who is corrupt?

40:40,43:53, üòÄüòÄüòÄso the banks are law unto themselves Billions "nkutha @MrMoyoT if I see any person in government living high off the hog while any black South African lives in squatter settlements and hungry then I have a BIG problem with corruption. so all the banks did the same things so they was definetly something dodgy I agree there was collusion how can you close a account without asking the client to explain Bank legal team line of operation is of legal nature so evidence before the team directs whether to consult the affected client or not 
45:02,46:46, well done deputy chief justice @Thando Nkutha shhh we're listening so interesting to hear this nice questio from Zondo It is very interesting that banks are being exposed now.

The gossip supported what they picked internally @peter pott @peter pott ....you starting to sound lie ZUMA üòÉ this guy looks uneasy @peter pott I agree. Sounds suspicious from Standard "so he is giving merits to the deformation of character case that might be opened incase they are not guilty with all charges
