"@Anne M. and it's our money that's paying him He looks so much like yesterday's witness😯 To welcome Tswana speaking foreign visitors to the country He's right to testify in language he feel comfortable. @Derick Mampuru Correct

I'm enjoying the seTswana guy. 🤐😴💩 mna xa sekubizwe mna ndifuna umntu translate ngesi mpondo ulwimi lwam endiluxelayo The guy is responding in English. It's a ploy for avoid stating much. They are soldiers and work for the Gov not in a Base so how do they run the Gov business with foreigners dignitaries? @Makosi Nobhatyi Ambassador yonke. I wish all tertiary education institutions can ask us prefered language to write exams

These soldiers "@Sinethemba Sakuba The language of office work is usually easy to deal with over time but for most people court language remains foreign. Unless you are exceptionally fluent shem ... 
19:22,20:28, This is going to be a looooooong day!! This guy works in government dept but cannot speak English!?!? Eish!!! Do they involve interpreter services in their meetings also? mzansi for sure "These are soldiers and everything to them is ""War"" and all tactics are permissible to win" It's the new game plan.... use interpreters so that when Zuma appears on the 15th.... they will run out of time before the 19th because of this tactic and he will not answer all the questions Ke tsotsi ye just by looking @ Aniceth De Missamou he is much comfortable with English Chinese ...and Rassians.....when they adress media they will use their language "@Sinethemba Sakuba If you understand English

22:18,23:07, why no video feed? @carnoth ngomane so would it be ok for Zuma to use an interpreter when he appears? video is on dom @ Phumla Setlhoke it does seem so.

I think this guy understands English and can speak it very well ke o o araba ka sekgowa 
27:13,29:11, He will tell the truth no matter what it's not the same guy 😂😂😂😂 Woow I will put my house on it that Zuma will use a translator just to waste time and money as well as frustrate the commission "Believe there is no delay tactics. Language is very important. Let's ignore the language ​He were able to prepare verbal notes but he can't express him self in English Give this guy a chance before criticizing him. We haven’t even heard his evidence yet!! All diplomatic languages are in French or English. All visas are in English. His testimony is in English 
29:41,32:06, @makhosi nobhatyi you're right. The you needs to invade the ANC so they can take over. Was there a translator while he was assisting the Indians? @ Thami Ngwenya indeed "Kolwana is back in the country Guptas didn’t need translators just 💰💰 "The guy just spoke English as the translator is slow. I y not producing note verbale..had enough time to prepare "The ANC is for all language speakers  @Aniceth De missamou hey I don’t think so people like these it is easy to be bribed Judge is taking over leading to save time 
32:21,33:10, @Molly Dhlamini The ANC is for looters and thieves - no matter what language they speak. @Aniceth De Missamou The constitutional recognition of our home languages was to ensure that the principle of equality before the law is not slanted to favour the dominant. Just accept it. he looks know nothing about his work...what is his academics? Derek Main that is not true "People stop nagging about the ""fact"" that the witness can speak English - he is allowed to speak the language of his choice. When YOUR future depend on the facts you share Me and the blocking button again "@Thapelo Motabogi exactly my point it a waste of time The witness leader is seemingly new or intern Why do you accept ordinary people to be applied there 
33:21,37:29, Derek you starting now @Molly Dhlamini.... The DCJ Zondo is also Zulu so why does he not use a translator then..... English is clearly note his mother tongue @Molly Dhlamini It's been proven over and over again. More of that will come out here at the commission. Derek Main do you understand the definition of a thief? @Molly Dhlamini I think so - someone who takes what does not belong to them. I'll answer that for Derek..... it's spelt ANC ha ha Derek Main ​@Molly Dhlamini I think so - someone who takes what does not belong to them without owners permission/consent. So sad.So very sad.The shame I feel is unbareable.Unbareable is the shame i feel 
37:32,39:46, "Derek Main  Robert Russel come on the judge uses english sir in court what is your urgument ? @Deon February I think we dealing with folks who have no idea how frustrating it is to be misunderstood. You get spoken to in a language that is secondary to your instinct to protect yourself. My Note Verbal : This will be a loooooong day for the Judge. @I Am Free that is fake news @ Yose Human What have we done as a nation of Zulus. @Molly Dhlamini All ANC deployees seem to be thieves. That is not to say they are the only thieves but the is looting of public funds by ANC cadres at all levels of government. Does something like this happen b4 or is it just something new? Why would you broke the protocol? this guy is interfering to me he understands English very well but soon he will spill the Beans

42:17,44:18, Jaguar Ftype kind of a roaring voice... can u hear him now will the evidence be different if he was speaking in English? @Molly Dhlamini Are you saying the ANC cadres have not been stealing public funds? Spot on Ibo Thabo- our people need to emancipate themselves in their minds- it’s urgent and crucial anc robberies The big players in the ANC used these small guys and then let them hang out to dry. IMHO @Derek Main .... they stole more than most "@Yose Human. your love or hatred for zulus is noted. say something different 
44:50,46:44, @Molly Dhlamini Please explain what the relationship between capitalist system and state have to do with stealing public funds. @Robert Russell At every possible opportunity. I'm thinking of blocking Yose. always Zulu this and Zulu that. come on bra. We are dealing with Waterkloof here Just study that and then we can talk- use class analysis as you do it I like this young looking evidence leader. But i am missing my favourite Ms September big time @Molly Dhlamini Sounds like a cop-out to me.

Yose is firing missiles and bombs at what he/she calls ""Zulus."" I only know black South Africans with their first language being Zulu." @Tikvah Olam Its not a crime to ask for translation. It is equally not a crime to understand English as well. None is exclusive. I know a lot of people who can conduct a conversation better in both "Ibo Thabo "DP is very smart these people they don't know who they dealing with. DP got what he wanted for now 
49:10,50:44, Yose are u waried about the country or with Zulu speaking people?? @Ibo Thabo.... same argument as yesterday that someone posted.... how about America and the Red Indians.... guess that is not a big enough success story for you International language of communication should not be a 1st language of any country. It should be done in an international 2nd language like Esperanto. @Michael Michael LOL...Yose is worried about Zulu speaking.... i stopped entertaining this months ago Lets learn to love and appreciate our languages and remember speaking english fluently doesnt mean you are intelligent "Hahahaha @Dominic Przybylski Agreed. 😂😂😂😂 "i said it 
50:48,51:51, Irritant is repeating what has been said in English. @Molly Dhlamini Still waiting.... Yose can u suggest any solution ??? @mike molefe Time wasting tactics here lol Are we still translating? Morning my people. no @funicanz Hi mntase he can speak english 😎🤷
