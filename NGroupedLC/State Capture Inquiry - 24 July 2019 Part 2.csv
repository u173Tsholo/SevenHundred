Does that count? hahahaha 😂😂 "keeping up with state capture "It’s not worth even looking at it this estina dairy farm is the one that pp find nothing wrong 
17:08,19:03, This guy is already playing dumb At this rate the commission will go on for years!! ekse ngubani le moegoe? Did the Guptas supply the copier ❓ malinga gv him time did statecapture started with Zuma or did it just continue with him? MR khumalo zondo already have the findings and recommendations in hand Mkwebane is no more a public protector but a politicians protector ans and a constitutional delinquent. Khomba khomba 
19:18,20:56, "David "Yes  For me I don't care as long as this commission will come to the conclusion that all those who did wrong go to jail iam fine @Jabu Malinga i was hoping someone could We hav what we know. Did Prof. Madonsela not start with this and then Mkhwebane took over? She was acting and then won a grammy award for her role as acting director "David So many directors... 
21:19,22:09, Zuma took corruption to a new level call state capture where they wanted to steal everytin..vat alles Where is money coz diary is no more sir @rohan 💵🤣😂 😂😂😂😂@rohan... @rohan barnard and that grammy came with few millions 6 @Jabu Malinga Zuma was probably corrupt from birth. "I do not know of Mbeki being corrupted and selling the country to a family Yes Jabu. They were very hungry these guys and Thabo was slow. 
22:26,23:38, @makhosi money is with guptas and others tjoh i cant keep up so many directors Hod's cfo mec it too much @Jabu Malinga Zuma was corrupt long before the Guptas i think .We know birds of a feather "Like arms deal corruption but the guptas has been there dor a loooooooooong time.... even before zuma "David what a mess Zuma has created Witness is Dr Tankisi Janki Masiteng @Jabu Malinga i think Guptas saw stupidity when the met with Zuma .GAve him money for his presidential campaign and beneifited 
23:46,25:07, @ Mohamed Mia 😃😃😂😂 this guy must not come here to lied The Arms deal was a sort off state capture corruption deal....Sarafina was the first known corrupt deal. ZUMA is going to jail that's why he is spilling the beans Thanks @Ewald Kruger Guptas have been waiting in shadows since the beginning of time. They only came out of the closet during zumas reign. Arms deal advertised JZ as somebody who took bribes so all bribers were interested in dealing with him. "David @Ewald Kruger This guy looks like a local taxi driver where i stay @Cerebis Yes u are rite. And the person implicated there was Nkosazana Dhlamini Zuma the ex wife of Jacob Zuma. 
25:24,26:50, "yes and with the courts for now "@David Jacobs no lol so many position's in one derpatment each has it own role If they were offering R600 million to buy a finance minister I guess a president isn't cheaper. The Guptas arrived in SA in 1993.... When they started meddling in our government affairs is unknown "If you ask zuma to say this number 👍 @Mrs Anderson 
26:51,27:44, jacobs is not a crime hahahahahahaha Ayeye Bro Jimmy ayeye💣 "Zuma proved that he knew nothing about maths "@Jabu Malinga he will start one  He is at the moment the Acting Head from Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Free State This witness knows it all but i doubt he will spill the beans "Foot lol 
28:04,30:48, Foot soldiers are the people who do the dirty work. they must just arrest and jail 1 foot soldier then these foot soldiers will turn easily against their masters @Dominic Przybylski 🤣🤣🤣 FOOT SOLDIERS??? CREATING JOBS??? "ohhh now we are stuck on the term ""folt soldiers"" can we move..." We’re all soldiers that obeying orders from 🤥🚿 "leave the foot soldiers I think Ace Magashule is busy now combine evidence which will contradict witnesses The Foot soldiers must be the guys who delivered the cows to Nkandla??? 
30:49,31:54, "commision waste of tax payers money Who is this corruptionist testifiying here "Officials who must be closer to the people Foot soldiers are normally people with little or no authority. the commisssion hopefully will ensure that this state capture will never again I really like the guy at the back. Foot Soldier = Used people "I’m with you Bedazzled "don't be surprised 
31:59,33:16, Will Ace and Zwane come to this commission or not if yes when i would like to here their side of the story. so as insignificant as we deem it hopefully it will lay down rules for the future if any after this sh&tt. where is mr 10% Do you need to wash your hands sir? ...but implementing agent is sought of Project Managers. Engineers will be reporting under this implementing urgency "but bee was a legal system..unjust as far as im concerned @Bedazzled @Mrs Anderson. Really??? I wonder what you girls are going to say when u see my foto. hahahaha How hard is it to start a dairy and giv each farmer 10 cows? this seems here lik it was rocket science @Pastor J Foto i know that word 
33:17,35:34, We will fall inlove with you Pastor. @Jabu Malinga I agree. How do you become a billionaire as a non-executive director? Only reason he was given directorships was to get inside line on government tenders. "Dominic hahah Mrs Anderson I read on IRR (Institute of Race Relations) site that CR was always late for meetings and always just voted with majority. 100 k @Bedazzled .Thank you but I may be a bit too old for you.@Mrs Anderson .Maybe not Ramaphosa is the better of all evils devil nontheless 
35:37,36:53, "lol 10 dairy cows would be about R120k idk what he is saying Boring Dr boring this guy lieg @Jabu Malinga A billion is a huge number. To count to one billion at R1 per second 24 hours per day 365 days per year will take more than 36 years. When will Timohty Omotoso case resume?? never "Precious 
37:18,38:15, "Dominic "@Mosco...you must follow "Ramaphosa was not getting involved M @Jabu Malinga Zuma had no clue how much money was looted He wont be able to grasp @Precious Ntshangase I hope that they are joining those dots. "@I Am Free Each so called beneficiary would have got 10 cows. Number of beneficiaries are many The dr is hiding some information acting dumb😄😄😄😄😄😅 Andile and Duduzane seem to have similar function. 
39:26,40:47, this guy is a doctor i will never consult Adv. Gcabashe 🔥🔥🔥 Didn't know one can get a phd from a technikon? maybe a spindoctor medical doctor?? #witchdoctor i her call him doctor nope @Cerebis Agri/profession 
40:49,41:55, The PFMA is pretty clear; I don't know what this waffle is about dr as in tittle bt not practicing......not medical dr...like Dr Ndlozi....... "@Dominic Przybylski you may say so but fact is Andile has his own business company Thanks Mosco skelm doctor PHD Studies @I Am Free .You are right. Reminds me of the ducks that the French extract the livers from to make Foie Gras the evidence is to confuse you and make it impossible to understand not by proffesion by qualification he has a doctorate in agriculture if im nt mistaken 
41:58,43:07, @makhosi nobhatyi I sincerely hope they are not the same but we are all suspicious now. PhD more like a pull him down 😂😂😂😂 he got his PhD via CUT guys He has a phd in physics 😂😂😂😂😂😂 phd in milking cows He did introduce himself where were you guys? 🤣😂😁😂😂 This man does sound well educated. so an instruction 'infiltrates down' ... oh ok so if No1 says implement a R1 Million project... 
43:17,45:21, We were working @Mosco @Mrs Anderson fair enough so am I. what is the lawyer wants to know now "He sounds like he hangs out with Zwane. he should have stayed in academia Phd in not paying ... suncity for wedding services... @Dominic Przybylski yes they are different but because he never discussed this to his father I think CR would stop him joining Bosasa if he was aware that he is looking for a contract "hey ppl I am against corruption but I hate anti-black comments that come in as we criticize corruption. Dr masipa 
45:41,47:21, "@Bedazzled thanks Dr Masiteng not sure of the spelling @Mzalwane Mzala 100000% "@makhosi nobhatyi I hope you will not be disappointed in CR? I fear that if he falls tx @Siphenathi Mbombo carry out instructions what a wooes @makhosi nobhatyi Let's hope so. CR is a lot more sophisticated than JZ so if he is crooked he'll hide it much better. He has been inspirational so far and I like what he says but why invisible before "Andile will come to testify here too  have to oblige what crap is he talking 
47:44,50:06, I see anti-black comments from such forums and the government is not involved. "CR will backstab the life out of his comrades. He is devil incarnate lets put it like this... mmm I'm waiting to see if CR has been hiding his backbone. I hope he has one. "@Mzalwane Mzala just like when you agree with Malema I’m Free 👏🏽👌🏾👍🏽 "@Mzalwane Mzala you are correct "@Cerebis I won’t be disappointed what is happening now they are trying to push CR away from his position because he promised us for fighting corruption South Africans need to change their perspective from being a race orientated nation 
50:12,52:39, "and really Chair Zondo Corruption is not a Black or White thing. Its simply corruption. The Guptas are not black or white incidentally @kevindbn007 Won't happen. As long as people vote along racial lines our politics will be racist. "El @Dominic Przybylski have faith man. indirect cross-examination yah this is cross examination all noted zuma was going to stop this ..where is his lawyer "@Dominic Przybylski I don’t think CR would be blinded by those who want to enrich themselves 
52:52,53:33, objection i see yu adv gcabashe yu cross examining dr now we see yu @makhosi nobhatyi I hope so. why this guy is dodging straight forward questions. Something tells me that as this guy develops his testimony he is going to do the Zuma thing Of doing a Donald and Ducking "I mean to speak plainly @Dominic Przybylski Politicians will make sure racism is kept alive - it serves their own interests well. Really his lawyer must intervene The back is out now a real learned adv...at her best 
54:07,55:31, "We area bit rough around the edges in SA does he have a lawyer this doctor? "Dr Masiteng is in the hot seat He will contradict himself this one...we are watching lol he does not think he was around.....hmmmm Fikile i don’t think he has lawyers coz heisin trouble objective adv gcabashe is being unfair on d doctor now "it was singed ON the 26th... certainty... ""but I don't think I was around"""
