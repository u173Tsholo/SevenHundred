"This lady collapsed SAA So why is she here really? she's wasting our time... It was lekker when she was stealing but now she cannot answer questions......What entitlement!!!! 
1:15:53,1:16:16, Come on Barry White Zondo is weak to Dudu shame not like others she treat her with soft gloves she is a ghost "Dudu Myeni has basically confirmed to the nation that she is guilty of theft Think Kate think quickly this is what is going to happen when the head thief comes on the commission on certain questions - like Vincent Smith - he still got arrrested can we just arrest her Let her reply to questions in writing. 
1:16:27,1:16:38, thanks for all your help. come on kate zuma's puppet.

Her position is clear. I suppose she wont answer questions about Eskom or JZ?? MenOfGod if she's not gonna answer on saa what's she here for? See : What Did I TJOON Youse .... * It Is My Understanding * To Completely Shut The Duck Up ! what she wishes...........aga nee "oh...yeah 
1:17:54,1:18:09, I dont want to answer any questions!!! Chair is scared of Myeni she's clearly reading her answers... honestly I think Dudu is right not to answer any questions before the commission because her case is already in court this is the precursor to what is coming with the crocodile this one is playing delaying tactics 🦁👅🐈 Shame the evidence laywer must stop everything and go Zondo sorry Mmmmmm......same story from her...ne
