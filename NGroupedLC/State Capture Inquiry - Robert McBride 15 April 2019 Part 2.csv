time,11:10,message hi makuthethwe klk Hi @Rishu Rishad McBriBE😀 BETTER exclude fairytales These 2 reports have been the topic for three days now ..... Maybe we were expecting much more exposures from McBride @Lorna Kavanagh and they are becoming boring for me.. me too Felix ... 
11:52,14:47, looks like pretorius is not prepared to move away from the two reports @carnoth ngomane 😂 "Aaaarrrggghhh @Lelatsa Raphula Daniel Khang true @Felix Muyoba and here we are waiting for the name of 30 high profile implicated people it appears the Judge and the Advocate are not happy about the answers they are getting as it does seems confusing @Lorna Kavanagh you absolutely correct there steinhoff commission should be next "@ofhie Muofhe esih 
15:21,18:52, 30 people ! but when will he get to that ? taken 3 days on the 2 reports. This is the man I’ve been waiting for 😂 "@Lorna Kavanagh it will take forever @Felix Muyoba Thats where corruption is being hidden by the media "30high profile implicated?? On SABCRadio they've just said 50ppl. Guys "Ex Police Minister Nleko did the unthinkable...interfere with the independence of IPID i feels as though he is taking the Judge and Advocate down the garden path.... @ofhie Muofhe the media wont bite the hand the feeds it @Magda Seguin no one will report on the doggy work that Werksmans did 
20:31,26:47, @carnoth ngomane its a shame to see us believing what the media say as the fact and final truth without proper research "Werksmans were paid millions ...when Mc Bride went to the parlamentary police committee it ended when McBride @ofhie Muofhe you are correct the media cant be trusted @Magda Seguin Why are we not being informed about those millions now. Werkmans sent two emails that Mr Pretorious showed this morning trying again to implicate McBride but the content was rebutted by him...they must becreported to the Bar .... i know that i am confused. i have fallen asleep many times "They conspired to get rid of all three ..but why so long to get clarity on the reports. They should payback the money coz they did a bad job 
28:13,38:29, When Cele did not want to extend McBrides contract he wrote a letter to parliament that heaviky implicated McBride that is why they voted incfavour of getting rid of him. Why is ENCA not covering the McBride testimony? @Lorna...for absolute clarity There was never a 'rendition' the constitional court found it false Now why was is it called 'Rendition' ? @ofhie...amaghunbane and daily maverick has done lots of investigative work...I th @Magda Seguin on what Rendition is a term that describes persons are rendered to another country...McBride and co was accused by the minister to have kidnapped and rendered people wanted by Zimbabwe thank you Magda. 
39:47,45:59, @Magda Seguin your Lawyerish neh Everything is in the public domain.Some political parties accuse investigative journalists to be stratcom thereby informing people not to believe the press so that they stay uninformed "I am not a lawyer is it just who is tired of this report run around. .... is The advocate getting to the nitty gritty. "I've just tuned in now. Mc Bride looks like a lier. I've not heard what he is saying but eeish The Judge has to have ALL the details for his final report and recommendations to the president. ''investigative journalist'' does that mean they write facts and truthful information. coz thats my concern. @phumudzo just looking at a person and deciding he is a liar?You must be able to read minds.The comments here always amazes me how judgemental South Africans are 
47:53,51:46, @ofhie absolute proof and evidence is checked before writing ANY article.It is only fake news that goes under the radar but there is a way to detect fake news instantly ​@phumudzo how did you conclude that McBride is a Liar Ace says he will sue the author of Gangster State but the author has all the evidence...he has lawyers that checked all the facts so if Ace sues all the proof will come out in court but to predict a fact is a false assumption of the truth Where are we vele vele?? Just tuned in and Zondo is posing in many funny lost ways!! I don't know. hence my confession of prejudice. pi would make a bad judge. I look at you once and decide if you are a sgebengu or not. @ Why didnt he put those evidence in front of a judge @phumudzo magidi Tell us what you see when you look at Ace Magashule. That should show us how accurate your decisions are. There is NO predictions...ONLY facts as per investigations and whistleblower testimony that is why journalists will never and can never be forced to name their sources 
51:53,53:50, pretorius always reserve matters for later I see a tsotsi "@Magda Seguin my problem is when you say people have evidence @ofhie Muofhe Adv Pretorius showed a slide on the 1st day of McBride's testimony;. On it was the number of cases sent to the NPA and the NPA didn't prosecute any. @phumudzo...you will get into serious trouble labelling people without evidence "@phumudzo magidi are there any elements of a tsotsi in him or his testimony @Anne M. am referring to evidence from journalist @Derek Main i see a tsotsi when it comes to that one @ofhie Muofhe Okay 
54:21,57:52, Nowhere in the world is it a journalists duty to open cases they are there to provide information in public nterest "@Magda Seguin  @Anne M. that shows that the NPA was 100% captured During Zuma's tenure it is now public knowledge that SAPS was also captured @Canon I don't even listen to evidence. I just judge from the looks @phumudzo magidi looks can be deceiving But is it a duty of a journalist to label a person as corrupt without any legal stand Zondo must remain as the Chair person... Is he talking about his bro now? and conflict of intrest 
58:09,1:04:57, The teacher in me always want to educate but since I dont lecture anymore I should just give it up "...as a Constitutional requirement @Magda Seguin please do ofhie is a troll I could spot a thug from a distance at bree street when I was still young. never got mugged all my life because I can see a nafarious person. I'm talking rubbish but Mcbride just looks like mashaya @Magda Seguin y am i a troll now Dzi khou vhuyesa ngoho It's Zondo via Zondo 
1:05:19,1:10:22, McBribe and Shabir Shaik must share a jail cell. "ofhie Muofhe If people do not want to accept your point of view I amazed at the ignorance of some people...especially those that are previously priviledged....those that benefited from apartheid @phumudzo magidi Excellent! Seems like your radar is working. And are still benefiting I see. @Sthakathi Khumalo Is detecting conflict of interest complex? hello to all my BANTU hi to caucasians 
1:10:57,1:17:02, yello to coolies n hotentots We live in cyber age...the literate have no excuse to be ignorant of theircenvironment Logic and reason flies out the window when you have populist right wing tendencies Hello @Fils de l'homme 😸 @Nelson Musoliwa Should be very simple. "I just think Free Catalonia. @Cerebis What's a Catalonia? I want one. 
1:17:06,1:27:02, And the Basque @Derek Main An Oppressed country by Spain. @Cerebis Yes - I've heard about it. Also think they should be free to be self-governed. Catalonia is still part of Spain (inside Spanish borders) "Catalonia was an independent region of the Iberian Peninsula – modern day Spain and Portugal – with its own language "Subsequent kings tried to impose the Spanish language and laws on the region "@Cerebis I know Andorre is situated between France and Spain...its a tax haven These are the bombshells we've been waiting for. 
1:27:22,1:33:24, Yep! let's listen to the recording. Real evidence Brigadier who... Who are these people Too much codes here.. DCJ is so embarrassed. they are busy eating and dining with the devil at the expense of their own pple shame Cant understand a word 
1:33:26,1:35:16, please someone give us a translation Translation please Patience yoh this is so chilling. "Only thing I understood was ""daai man"" . Tshwane lingo😂😂" @michael mbatha 😂😂😂 Mcbride was to be assassinated wow Jo 
1:35:59,1:51:23, mara Adv Pretorious is lazy! he doesn't want to continue! "No man he is tired Break... To stretch their legs. I saw on Twitter state capture handle it was Mr Khuba and Mr Seseko on the phone "I typed 'state capture' in the twitter search bar and came across their account I follow State Capture on Twitter. It help when I get confused 🤣🤣 "Pretorious was right to argue about next evidence that will come after McBride looks liJoe its getting hot in the kitchen 
1:52:00,2:02:10, "@Madelein most of my reading depends in actual authentic documentation "I not active @Eslon Eslon who's younger brother is implicated? @makhosi the next witness is General Booysen of KZN...he was set up in the so called Cato Manor debacle that the Sunday Times published....all turned out to be false Zondo younger brother whois an advocate "@Lorna Kavanagh hahaha or rather what is he alledged to be implicated in? @ Magda Seguin thank you Jeffrou @makhosi 🤣 
2:03:01,2:07:30, it will be a travesty if DCJ Zondo is recused... Judge Zondo's brother chaired McBrides disciplinary before he was suspended..Mr Pretorious read out that he does not want to testify or cross examine McBride @Fils de I'home.. DCJ Zondo younger brother chaired an inquiry that was set up to victimize Mcbride for doing his job @Eslon Eslon so this commission now runs the risk of being discredited money being given by anc to elders - yikes "Magda Seguin  "I don't agree @Lorna...if he stays it will be fertile ground for the im0licated to say there is conflict of interest.One has to avoid doubt or suspicion Kgamanyane is from the Free State?? I smell Ace here... it's an enquiry not court case 
2:07:49,2:10:23, @Lesego Khumalo ACE is a skelm BANTU "@Lew464 what gives you the right to label me as a victim.You know nothing about me.Be careful @Fils.. .Gangster! What the heck is 'white exclude'? "@Fils de I'home... That's my only concern now bcos there's a potential conflict of interest on the part of the chair A None Black. Clandestine transfer of personnel in IPID during the state capture machinery roll out I am not scared of anyone...least if all white people...my late husband was a white foreigner and I travelled more places than you ever hope to see. "Magda Seguin  
2:11:13,2:15:13, Go away with your crass attitude...there are decent people on this forum...you are the typical troll "@Eslon Eslon considering this revelation @Lew464 Are you threatened by me? You have a false name and a cartoon for your avatar...that says a lot...what and who are you? "@Magda Seguin Calm down. Ignore the race baiters! Please can you refrain from what appears to be some issue with ""White people""???" "Magda Seguin  I will not refrain from anything...they are allowed to say and insult on a daily basis...I never recoil from these worms @Lew464 South Africa isnt a black country don't let small things bug you. we pink and different shades of brown so no white or black crap here. @Lew464 not all white countries are first world 
2:15:51,2:17:24, "@Lew464 South AFrica is a mixed country "with less than 10% euro African I was brought up by educated parents and studied long and hard.Ypu are a disgrace to humanity insulting someone you don't know anonymously...what are you scared of? this can only end badly @Lew464 u r a racist BLOCKED AND REPORTED "Please stop this spat "peace This is how white supremacy acts 
2:17:30,2:21:55, @Le Roux Strydom VOTE for the FREE TRANSVAAL party "Magda Seguin  Blocked and reported Magda "@Lew464 - You don't know Magda @Lew464 u r braking the code of ethics. it is the Caucasian burden to help the BANtu Hi guys you must do yourselves a favour and Google Byron Katie then you can understand why you are so unkind to one another...lets do the work very interesting for personal growth "Caucasian ""BURDEN"". Why?" watch how Rwanda reconciled - great lessons to be learned "Magda Seguin  
2:22:03,2:26:59, @Luvuyo Zantsi... Do not get it twisted. Pretorius raised the issue bcoz Zondo's younger brother was involved in Mcbride's disciplinary hearing. Sesoko never appeared for Pretorius to raise the matter "@Fils de l'homme I didnt know there is such an option but not interested  @Greg Stewart Very True and I agree! But the words used on this forum at times are very similar to what started the Rwandan tragedy. "@Eslon Eslon you are wrong "@Le Roux Strydom - Fils is not well @Le Roux Strydom what do u mean? @Madelein Huxtable u hav really hurt my feeling with ur very nasty and uncalled for insults @Cerebis lets encourage respect - we really do not want a repeat - 1994 is very important to south africans and Rwandans but "@Fils de l'homme - we spoke to you about the Transvaal thing on Friday 
2:27:12,2:30:42, Rwandans have be best economy growth in africa 25 years later @Madelein Huxtable so u dont want me to lobby ppl about a cause that I believ in? I just want to make it clear...white supremacy and fascism is real...an example is what happened in New Zealand.I smell them a mile away.It has nothing to do with my prejudice but reality "Transvaal is gone phew!! is it going to rain in sub sahara africa tomorrow just block Fils it will lower your blood pressure. think he is DZ "@Madelein Huxtable I believe that the transvaal must be reinstated "Fils @Luvuyo 🙏 
2:30:52,2:32:39, I don't see Fils' bile - blocked him long ago. Madelein block the chop everyone else has and font see his comments "@Madelein Huxtable i dont want apartheid back and it is an unfair comparison "and yet we are reminded every day of ""apartheid""...by blacks." The ou Transvaal and Apartheid belongs in the past. Ou Transvaal was run by Apartheid. successfully and peacefully. wow handing out rank here like 123. 
2:32:40,2:33:09, re Judge is reading and listening and laughing 😆 😃😃 the recording Lol it's like committing suicide. @Madelein Huxtable the South Africa we know was run by apartheid and I dont think that is correct whats with the dodgy conversation If I was against white people I would have refused to care for soldiers returning from the border 'war We all deserve respect but respect is also earned mara why hel

Some of those soldiers had such bad post traumatic stress syndrome just like the MK soldiers...I scared for anyone in my care irrespective of who they were *cared @Derek Main - thanks derek

This is why I keep on saying that we have to work as one nation now. come let us hear translation And blind accusations... @Helen Terry well said @Helen Terry - Agree hello hello Exdoms fault

Well done @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Nguni's are BANTUs you guys are whomever wants to devide instead of heal this nation. @Madelein Huxtable u r right but my people are the people of the transvaal I will never say anything here that I can't say to your face so please stop being facetious I hate being addressed as if I'm a fool 
2:43:37,2:45:38, @Madelein Huxtable You are off course wrong in saying that Transvaal comes from Apartheid? The Republic of Transvaal was founded in 1852...a little time before the Sad Apartheid period. "KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU  @Magda Seguin - have you started on biography book yet? "@Fils de l'homme Just like my surNAME? aNYWAY @Magda Seguin - Don't waist your energy on them. It is not worth it "@Lew464 Careful @Cerebis - I know where Transvaal came from. Uncle Paul Kruger @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU yes it means ppl @Magda Seguin thank you for caring... I am one of the PTSS survivors (1975)... and we were expected to do things we might not have agreed with or go to jail..... this has cost me many relationships 
2:46:14,2:48:36, "I know what i am basing my argument from.... from a South African perspective and previous experiences...i'd prefer ""Nguni than Bantu.""" @Fils de l'homme are you also one of bantu since you say it means ppl? not from wikipedia. Just from personal knowledge and a word commonly used from the 50's. I remeber. I will check wikipedia though. "@carnoth ngomane inirectly yes I am a BANTU @Lew464 bantu is not a derogatory word "@Lew464 50s??? Gosh lol @Fils de l'homme what do you mean indirectly? @carnoth ngomane inderectly is the opposit of directly 
2:49:00,2:51:34, @Robert Russell - People don't understand really what happens to a person who goes through Trauma. And yet so many people are suffering in silence. All you can to is take it day by day @Greg yes thanks it's going well "Bantu speakers migrated southwards two main groups emerged @Madelein Huxtable and war as a 18 year old is more than most can imagine.... thank you for relating @Fils de l'homme i know i wanted you to say it and that can solely mean you dont see yourself as one of the so called bantu nation "Agrizzi style here right? Anyway "@Robert I really have empathy for all the men who went through the trauma ...there was never proper debriefing @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU r u working at someone's garden busy cutting the grass? @Robert Russell - I had a family member that was in the Angola war. We all suffered. 
2:52:39,2:55:16, "Europeans also migrated to south africa (dutch At least the Americans are trying and I'm not sure if it wasn't for societies intervention they would be treated any different to the way we were.@Magda Seguin "@Fils de l'homme  "Digitised garden "@Greg Stewart - there was a programme on enca on the weekend regarding migration.

2:55:57,2:59:25, "@Madelein Huxtable - I believe the count is on europeans not zibabweans they not called migrants but illegal migrants but there are thousands of them believe me "@carnoth ngomane Yes He's dumb... am sorry hence the xenophobia problem - love and live SA @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU i can see "@carnoth ngomane Yes "@Robert Russell take care Why is Zondo asking if Mcbride is comfortable with Pretorius's questions? 
2:59:26,3:03:10, "@carnoth ngomane I see in this country I like the translation 😂 "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I was just askinga question @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU he should know that some of us are watching this inquiry in our offices not another man's office Thank you Magda..... much appreciated @carnoth ngomane are u a PA? @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU it comes with a package we dont get to choose "@Fils de l'homme may you could be my PA "@carnoth ngomane Yes
