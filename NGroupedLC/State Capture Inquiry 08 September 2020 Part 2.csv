I dont have any experience and I also suffer from amnesia.... its 1 of the pre requisites..I presume.. after listening to all these losers...

The surname has answers......😂🤣 @Pillay ANC can't pay it's salaries but you guys still want to apply....... lol go ahead TSOTSI...TSOTSI...TSOTSI..:oops::oops::oops::oops:

They dealing with 2015 stuff in 2020 
1:27:20,1:29:31, Tsotsi appears not to have an appetite to take ownership of what was happening at Eskom. He's tiring me actually Shiny but empty head noone has secretary's or HR departments to deal with business. in our country the bosses make the business. mr tsotsi no man i'm not seeing much diversity here Corruption is the only job ANC have chameleon 😂😂😂😂 They got rid of him to make way for Brian Molefe? Thats what made headlines this morning. he was doing nothing this guy 
1:29:35,1:31:10, what the F was Talente doing at a meeting!!!! @KylePGraphics NPA still not ready to take Arms Deal case to court - 15+ years later. waiting for that armsdeal case they want to open the commission again review u ya jola 99 We need Jub Jub's investigators here They don't play awu hamba TSOTSI👏👏 @Tlou they must absorb all investigators and advocates of the commission into the NPA maybe some prosecution will take place. I recommend Hofmeyer to be its director

Where is the IMF US$4.3 billion loan?? if you dont do what gupta say Whatever happened to Afriforum's private prosecution project? What ever happened to those Russian Doctors i Zumas case postponed to 8 Dec "@Riaan 
1:32:56,1:35:03, What happened to those cuban doctors? Only result has come from civil case where OUTA got Dudu to be declared a delinquent director. But she is still director of 5 companies. Nobody takes law or ethics seriously in this country. cuban doctors wil b used for money laundering Why isnt the Guptas and the Zumas in prison for 50 years?? Nobody with political connections gets punished for breaking the law. OUTA make me sick sometimes @Banathi 🤣😂 Don't ask me about them "440 Million for Cuban doctors @TLOU MASOGO OUTA still only organisation which has achieved some results. 
1:35:07,1:37:06, @Dominic Przybylski - please send me proof I want to follow this up which companies?

1:44:51,1:49:25, @Kwo Even worse! Why is the chair putting his mask on though 😂 Soviet training of ANC youth instilled communist propaganda into ANC consciousness. Unfortunately the inevitable failure of yet another communist attempt is being interpreted as a racial failure. "@Thobani Mkananda been asking myself that for the longest time🤣🤣 i think racism is very mean nobidy say hi dutch im dad @Lady T Some things are better left alone 😂🤣 As long as he does the job mara a.a 🤣😂 I've gotten so bored I'm now just watching those Pakistan Memes 🤣🤣🤣

EFF just trying to look relevant awe ekse tsotsi no recording of the meeting khona ok'shizayo la😊 @Akhonamandla apparently they have strong beef between them and anyone who works for ENCA 
1:58:26,2:00:52, Eff thinks that everyone is scared of them...... "@LadyT a meeting was scheduled at the president 's residents to discuss the removal of three eskom executives corruption will NEVER end unless the country has a complete overhaul of the justice system and proper limitations on parties guidelines they should follow ........ @Trevor bee Botes u got issues with EFF EFF struggling with infighting "the leaders @Hlagala Where does Zuma's son feature in the happenings in governance? 😂🤔 "so it's clear joining government is nothing less then a low earning job and the only reason you there is for change  "lol @Krakra that's what I've noticed

"Pie and coke @Akhonamandla Where's my brother @Aubrey Van nton-nton? 
2:25:24,2:28:30, thats why the ANC need there votes. They can't afford what working poeple have ie. wifi etc. so they don't get the info of whats going on in gov Is there actually a party that can change things around in South Africa? @SABC Where are the visuals? Or start sending ANC officials to jail until they find the honest ones? "@Thobani i was wondering the same thing I don't think so. Coalition is prob the only way out :goodvibes::yougotthis::goodvibes: sending ANC off to jail will take another 5/10 years Sounds like a Plan @Andre Gerber 
2:29:12,2:36:18, "@Akhonamandla I hope he's fine. People like him can be seen to be posing a threat Please pray that the people of South Africa see through this corrupted govt 🙏 @Thobani Mkananda😂 I am not leaving without him. @Yolo More 😂🤣 You must do the honourable thing therefore and duly compensate this virtual community for taking him away 🤣😂😅 "@Akhonamandla Gala flexibility baba 😂😂😂😂 True @Gala @Thobani Mkananda never. I am taking back what was stolen from us. No compensation for what belongs to us. @Yolo More What do you say about people who were not involved in stealing him and found him here. We'd be at a loss as community without him. 😂🤣😅 Compensation or death 😅🤣😂😂 
2:37:56,2:42:52, @Thobani Mkananda Who do you want to kill with your compensation or death? just play the recording!🤣😅 We don't have a death penalty in South Africa for croks.

""" IT GUYS SORTING- OUT DE BACK-UP 1ST B4 GOING ON AIR""" but zondo should have gave him chance to go through the audio I mean its fair that way @Andre Gerber It's unfortunate norm. Punishing someone without making them feel any pain 🤔 
2:52:33,2:55:55, Who's paying for this now that all the tax money has been stolen? "Must be amazing working for the ANC  @ Riaan😂 golden handshake🤝 @Thobani Mkananda actually I think you dont belong here as well. I am afraid I will have to take you with me as well.😂 Your family is across the road. Just got home... only to hear Zondo talking reeeaaalllyyy slowly... @Tlou sound technicians are working on it.... Imagine ANC members only got scared when Gupta's gave them a Written warning 🤣🤣 "@Riaan Actually Has anything interesting happened today?

3:00:11,3:08:35, And honestly speaking @Yolo More 🤣😅😂😂🤣 Much love 🤣😂😂 🤣🤣🤣 This madalas surname is synonymous You can't win if you have recordings. In the case I mentioned everything on camera WAR ROOM? = LOOTING MACHINE ROOM?? @Riaan W.A.R watch out for Revolt (any infiltration which might hinder the looting plan) not a physical space 🤣😅😂 He cannot recall anything except PAY DAY and his FAT anc salary they learned from the best Zuma I can't recall I can't remember everything it's a long time ago 
3:09:53,3:17:37, The Lawyer looks like Seal's. take away the hair and glasses reminds me of Seal @ Riaan you right ...WAR ROOM=Theft ROOM WAR (What About Redeployment) Room @ Andre 😂😂:elbowcough: very strange indeed unless corruption and bribes involved it is very strange Mr Zondo when Ms Myeni chairs Eskom board with her son Talent in Zumas residence in Durban......

3:18:00,3:22:00, chair you can finalise your report. you and we have heard enough. very puzzling 🤷‍♀️ @ma Baker 😂🤣 they were showed there cuts The more I watch this commission the more I realize how pointless it is withoit consequences and a follow-up prosecution... The Board was captured. recoddle 🤣😂 instead of 'recording' The Chairman of the Board was captured. The fish tots from the head. "@ William 
3:22:07,3:24:38, commission is a gig I'd choose almost anything other than Net-useless-flix @ William commission I'll never forget Mr nzeku n nomvula makonyane @A b c the prosecutions should be running parallel with this according to mini reports that the chair should be compiling. This inquiry may run for the next 3 years 🤦🏾‍♂️ some Epic moments of reality. But I feel like we're stuck in an endless cycle that'll never end but is costing lots of money... @Thobani I see... "The ANC has been so busy looting over the years these people took oaths hard to believe 
3:25:17,3:29:48, @Riaan from 2007 there was no plan. they compiled a vision and called it a national development plan I think it was Apparteid's fault Above the Law and people of SA mhhh too much corruption "@Ndumieh Mokoena That's a sad truth. . . These commissions lost what contemplated for the love money our country caught fire but what do people want to do with so much money.... especially those claiming to understand the revolution?????.... @abc ANC were fighters who did well and should have passed on governing powers to the civilians who knew how to run the country period. "It's definitely the money's fault

It sounds like ""Itsotsi yaseZola""." the ice is melting ayyy zondo is out of order 
3:48:53,3:52:41, That'll just give him all the time to come up with excuses 🤣🤣 lol "Oh boy... the cycle just keeps turning... and we're all stuck in it... every day's the same old thing ayyy le coconut ye advocate 😂😂 But at least it's better than Netflix... lol miss Duuuuduuu Tsotsi's gonna hit us with all the excuses he'll come up with tonight... he won't sleep...

Thobani Mkananda! The name and surname are fascinating. Not when the ANC is still in governance. or else they will have their own special cells 🤣🤣 @Mondli Hlatshwayo 🤣😂 argh they gave my mind a hard time. Was I perhaps distracted by the chants of the EFF. Dudu-Myeni as one name /Duduzane Zuma in full 😂🤣😅😂 "Evidence leader : Are you a ""tsotsi"" from Zola
