time,-0:06,message what time is lunch time ending 5 minutes late DCJ ended 5 minutes ago Ja & I'm waiting 4 ever 4 him 2b back Late again African time Zondo "It's like the Nuremberg trial eeheeh mmh mmh when are they going to start. 
0:22,20:28, Yes they back Hi who’s in the chair? what is he suspected of doing? N.G. he was CEO at Escom when he was suspended without any explanation and replaced with Molefe. 👀 Only 2 South African Companies have a higher turnover than ESKOM - Anglo American and Sasol. So this man should be around the 3rd most qualified/succesful businessman in the country. If he wasn't then why was he in that position? ANC He was suspended following instructions from Zuma and Myeni to the board. scapegoat 
21:38,30:04, he was suspended as part of the state capture project "Quest exactly. That is when 3 executives where suspended and Singh They understood perfectly. Unfortunately the witness did not serve the Gupta Agenda which was loading at the time. kana how much is this commission costing us? "Aow Kamo papa @Kamogelo Maphunye a small fraction on what is going to be spent on giving free laptops to university students. "if you lie enough you convince yourself it's true. I don't think people can believe what they are seeing at Zondo  Why spent so much time on this? We know he was unjustly treated. the Commission must interrogate the real wrongdoers at Eskom @kamogelo it's costing us peanuts compared to what the guptas have looted 
30:45,35:31, and get the criminals involved in State Capture in jail. That is what the public wants to see. This Commission is costing the public millions and millions and we are not yet seeing justice being done "It seems this is all just noise... Why isn't SARS going after people who get anc always push out all honest people so that its hyena may feed comfortably on our money Yes!@Salome Seabi buenos dias to mi hermano y mi hermana please take pride in serving your nation country and people with lead with love peace release your country from bandage of slavery remember your history adios. Miss Klein must testify "If you don't tow the line Salome so true. We lost great people with high integrity who was discarded because they were not prepared to sell their souls to the corrupt hyenas. Do we actually have a government assuming a government provides economic infrastructure and rule of law? 
35:38,39:37, Ms Klein is a cheerleader for Koko!!!!!! you're right #salome seabi this guy was just an honest hard working person "I agree Ms Klein just another little Zupta puppet. Ngubane a big Gupta enabler "If the NPA can get the best senior counsels in SA to deal with all crooks of state capture Koko was the only suspended executive who retained his job. It is now clear why. "@jw Perow The President signed a proclamation that will enable the NPA to work directly with the investigators of the Commission. There is also the Fusion Center(Hawks 😱 
40:17,43:05, "the whole cabinet knew what was happening Zakes you are right. "Veneta Klein had until her stint at Eskom Even if NPA eventually charges somebody it will be years before they actually get a court date. "thats the question what about if the npa enlists the service of the FBI? Special courts must be established to deal specifically with state capture hyenas Still waiting for JZ to appear in court 15+ years later and still counting. Salome you are right. The NPA was completely destroyed by the likes of Jiba and The Sheep. 
43:19,45:15, yes Ngubani will be in trouble The ANC must just accept this time that they've wronged the country really everything is just a mess. :goodvibes: Mhakosi let us hope so Shamila Batohi does not seem to be doing any better than her predecessor. Ngubane is have dirrheah becos of this witness the ANC & Zuma alway said it's our time 2 eat "ANC has allowed wrong people to infiltrate it 
47:04,49:05, sad that black professionals were treated like this by those who used the WMC bull Huzet chair? Oliver Thambo is turning in his grave due to the current ANC cadres They must charge Ben Ngubane with perjury @HlagalaMasetlale Yes @Ms G tricky as Tshediso 'could' be mistaken. who is this advocate? Yes @Hlagala Masetlale Ramaphosa must act on the recommendations of this commision as a matter of MUST 
50:03,54:25, lol was he also in this murky business? And if they were doing recommendation in each inquiry maybe it will be better Yes Hlagala He sits in many boards of companies. Ngubane must be charged really ASAP wonder if it wasfked? was faked? BOOM! this is the reason why Ngubani was so arrogant 🙄 ngubane must be charged with that guy who doesn't remember when did he get married. 
54:31,57:11, PLZ in next elections NO 1 must vote ANC exactly AND VERY ARROGANT Hlagala apperently he was in a business relationship with a Gupta associate. Salome I Voting anc will be treasonous crime Ngubani was the same one who defended Cloudy Hlaudi and gave him a massive increase. "DCJ this EL always give wrong papers "I hate facemasks uner the nose 
57:18,1:01:28, the DCJ is well trained on COVID-19 protocols...🤣🤣🤣 what a waste of time!!!! Salome sesbi I personally agree with u we must keep our votes yes my br "ngubane is the granddaddy of state capture true on that we must keep our vote Please guys really when voting lets think of the up coming generation really this is set what ANC did to the Nation @Mokadi yes One thing this commission has taught me is that the main crooks are gogos and madalas...... 
1:01:33,1:03:48, "you need to spk to the 30Million there are advocates and aSSH@@les - which one is this evidence leader? We must all spread the word that no 1 must vote anc @dennis oldude today's evidence leader is pedantic but thorough we must canvas agaist anc to save SA FOR OUR CHILDREN people who are not watching this will still go vote ANC I wonder what would happen if Zondo were to fall ill. All of a sudden he's deaf @Carmen James i like him now 
1:04:23,1:06:53, But we must hard to spread the word really Sally you right NO 1 must wear Ramaphosa T shirt during next elections People who will vote ANC really it means they blind You must bear in mind that when the ANC are voted out their new mission will be make the country ungovernable. Just look at GP and EC @carmen yaa started very slowly general salute the ppl are more powerful than anc crooks. dont be afraid of them It is time for revolutionary groups to step aside smh 
1:07:13,1:10:45, not afraid of them just of their ability to destroy Where is ths gping - and why? ok while we are still in Eishkom can someone please tell me where are the so called experienced technicians from Italy who came to help us with load shedding? when is Lynn brown going to appear?i hope she is going to remember everything. "for 27yrs guys really this is too much we need to move on really @BOIKANYO MOLOI hahahahaha """as it were"" - is this just mannerism?" "Hlagala remember how she fumbled 
1:10:50,1:14:13, dO YOU THINK THOSE TECHNICIANS CAME INDEED "we gave EFF a chance & look what happened mind you we pay them exorbitant amount of money from their food to their transportation @Puleng Dikgale Sort of saying the same thing but in anotehr way and looking for agreement Ben ngubane gupta Cuban doctors might be getting UIF they spend more time looking for papers and numbers than doing real quentioning thanks to #voetsekANC As long as we vote on the basis of race we remain captured by apartheid. 
1:14:27,1:16:43, no work no service only corruption..aluta continua The eff are our arbitors of outrage. misunderstand oh jaaaaaaa "DOnt like em Yes @Elton Josea . He is very thorough "Jongi Cayalli the was no miss understanding is Malema's wife wearing her natural hair or brazilian hair? @Carmen James update please 🙈 Racism IS PAINFUL TO THE CORE 
1:16:53,1:19:22, @Jongi Cayalli umuncu sani Dont dismiss peoples reaction to Clicks. The anger is very valid indeed AND UNACCEPTABLE NOW AND FOREVER I think they are the government in waiting becaurs they are the ones who explore the ANC from the Zuma leadership "Hi@Lady T. We are still listening to evidence as to how the State Capture Agenda got rid of the witness as Eskom CEO to pave the way for Molefe Clicks is an overseas co. with a staff compliment of 90 percent black mogau what if it was our own black brother or sister who was making that advert? is it still ras Wow! Must be nice to have such an easy life that one has the time to be enraged by a Clicks advert. @Mogau Mphahlele although ppl in that field need to think a bit more.... 
1:19:47,1:21:52, "@Lady T and the Minister Lyn Brown. Of course all this followed a meeting between Brown racism smells very bad incase you didnt know RACISM INDID SMELL 2 MUCH # Jong.. it doesn't matter who is doing it. "@Jongi Cayalli I had same question. Also Obsession with race stinks. NO EXCUSE IS ACCEPTABLE ON RACISM IF I IS NOT AFFECTED BY RACISM CANT BE OSSESED BY IT Salome agree 110% 
1:22:28,1:24:30, @Mathys Botha being 90% black doesn't mean that the advert was not racist. The people who approved the advert were racist. Clicks promoted that racist act by playing it in public. I concur "@ Carmen I concur with Jordan and Salome Yes @Eddie Reddy . I agree :dothefive: untidy indeed!!! incompantance and no skill or qualifications @siphiwe. I dont think the eff or its damage duty people knows the origin of the advert. it was not even done by clicks... Unilever made the Ad and Unilever is black dominated. 
1:24:58,1:26:29, Our witness is a gentleman. He definitely wasn't suitable for the State Capture Agenda. CLICKS MUST B TAUGHT A LESSON "Eddie the meeting in Durban with Zuma was attended by then Escom chairman is this the Sirkus? And so must the ANC @Salome Seabi Donrt shop there and get your friends to do the same.... YES "doing what is being done to Clicks salome i bet u the first 2 shop at Clicks month end.. 
1:26:32,1:28:37, "@Salome Seabi The people suffering at Clicks are the people being threatened by EFF @Seelan&Patsy Pillay easy baking 101 stop insulting people @Jongi Cayalli lol All corporations and multinationals must also take cue and do away with structural racism... AT LEAST LOSING PROFIT WILL RETURN SOME SANITY How do they even stay awake in there???? At the end of the day the ad was just full of racism WHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAaa Apartheid largely stopped due to disinvestment measures 
1:28:50,1:30:03, @Deanos Rides Only special people can do this job...LOL @salome... do you even know anything about the advert? what the evidence is? dont go judging people without giving them a chance to explain. remember 90% of the staff is black.. LOL! "it's easy for ppl power to close clicks so u don't have dry hair Mogau @salome.. are you or the EFF going to put food on the table of the staff that won't earn an income?? "Not at all "@Dominic Przybylski no sir. We don't ignore racism 4C TYPE 
1:30:11,1:31:11, yey all these media and newspapers are own by white in the country of story NO IVIDENCEV IS REQUIRED IT IS CLEAR AS ABC 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴 management of clicks should have checked the ad before they use it. the re either dom or just racist Thabo🌟🌟🌟 I BETTER STARV RATHER THAN BEING UNDERMINED BY ANOTHER HUMAN BEING "@Mogau Mphahlele You should have seen the sunscreen advert lol It showed a black person without a sunscreen The thinking of put up and shut up is never going to be eternally sustainable @Eddie Reddy i agree with you 
1:31:20,1:32:46, "Those thousands of people who are working for clicks must not vote for eff clicks is a great company I m sure they are truly sorry they just need to fine them like other.... This evidence leader has hit his stride. THE CULPRIT AT CLICKS MUST BE FIRED Evil prevails when us the innocent remain silent. Being employed by someone doesn't mean they can insult you and you should be happy about it @Ncise the disrespect Salome I salute and I concur "@Thabo Ngwenya He cant tell people when and when not to open shops! Hes a politician 
1:32:55,1:34:41, @Salome Seabi . Its a Black man...a certain Mr Mabena MUST B FIRED I think everyone on this live chat got no life... except minding other people's business... take a look at your own life and count your sucess and failure....I'm sure the failure will be more...bye... UNACCEPTABLE Free market allows you to buy from a competitor if you don't like Clicks. "chats are disturbing "So what? What must we do then ? I don’t understand why you fight these companies coz they employed people @Salome Seabi These matters are regulated by labour law. THE LAW IS SLOW SOMETIMES 
1:35:02,1:36:23, Zondo commision is exposing ZA Socialism at its best... "@Thomas Cleghorn again brother @Salome Seabi That may be true. But we can't make our own laws no matter how aggrieved we may be. This was in my recommended.. EFF EFFORTS MUST NOT B INVALIDATED 😑 ._. im out EFF = Malemas private bank account.. Malema aka the original tenderprenuer.. 
1:36:29,1:38:01, Malema se gat @Salome Seabi This is not about the EFF... @Thabo Ngwenya what about when JM asks his supporters to maybe target cockroaches? "So you guys are saying its ok for clicks to disrespect us just like that Neva Eva @Thomas Cleghorn what about it? Was I in the comment section when you discussed that? Please bring me up to speed so I can make informed comment. u can tell those going on about EFF are ama2000 & they c nothing wrong here just like ANC members Exactly. I agree @Jabu Malinga Lets focus on the commission and stop crying over silly adverts 
1:38:22,1:39:17, @Mogau Mphahlele Just don't buy from them if you don't like them. That's how it is done in a civilized society. Of course it may take us many years to achieve that level. "anc GUYS WE MUST ALL CONTRIBUTE TO NATION BUILDING IRRESPECTIVE OF OUR COLOUR @Civilized wow 🙄 😘🌈 Nation building se GAT....:buffering::buffering::buffering: THANK YOU SALLY Mogau plz stop saying US we not at the taxi rank. speak 4 urslf Exactly @Salome Seabi . Nation building not mud slinging 
1:39:20,1:40:31, For those who pretend to care about the black workers at Clicks. Please tell us what is so hard about FIRING THE MARKETING EXEC and cancel contract with the Ad Agency? Whats hard? problems eish @Mogau Mphahlele burning and looting is not considered civilized in the rest of the world. Did you see the video of the EFF people storming in to Clicks @Thabo Ngwenya There are processes to be followed. "Zuma and his faction once CR17 President Ramaphosa should know everything what was going on "@Thabo Ngwenya No he didnt (yet @Jongi Cayalli i never mentioned you so chill @ thabo... the ad was done by TRESSEME... a Unilever brand.... not CLICKS...what part of the ad dont you understand 
1:41:08,1:42:41, maybe tomorrow will be entertaining than this second part🚶‍♂️ @Carmen James they can separate though settlement. Its not impossible to convince an exec to leave. It gets done daily. please dont make excuses Clicks in Queenstown @Dominic Przybylski last time i checked nobody burned anything @Mogau Mphahlele Check again. I HATE RACISM AND APARTEID TO THE CORE @Thabo Ngwenya . I am not making excuses. Merely stating a fact....Settlements come as the result of a PROCESS. BOTH MAKE ME VOMIT 
1:42:43,1:45:45, They demolished shelves @ Mogau Mphahlele True @Carmen James A process which can be conducted by simple meeting of execs Mogau im chilling🍦🏖⛱ with my Clicks clubcard Exactly @makhosi nobhatyi "@Thabo Ngwenya . Be that as it may "@Willie Truter we can multitask these guys can't even grow grass.... how are they going to farm any crops to feed their families..??:oops::oops::oops::oops::oops: ok cool 
1:45:57,1:49:35, "no production "Yes @Carmen James I agree Our evidence leader is on point. CEO was appointed as part of the arranged package by Gov? its long gon that u guys should hav realised that we achieved nothing.. we r dead n gon..no coming back They had a plan to destroy STATE ENTERPRISES is clear "no work ethic.. only want want want. get pregnant "@Carmen James Thanks. He was pushed out of the position but considering the answer he gave in respect of pension package This gentleman has been the best witness in weeks. He obviously doesn't have anything to hide. 
1:50:25,1:52:45, Jabu agree with you @Carmen James Spot on. Hes here to dirty everyone else. Carmen I know the guy shame Mom @Thomas Cleghorn I think that they dirtied themselves. He is just exposing what happened. why is this guy even on the stand. he is not a culprit. maybe he is to give insight on how officials should behave. @Mathapelo Mokadi You do? I am very impressed with his testimony after listening to the lies of Mama Action and Vincent Smith last week..... They fired him bcause they wanted to blow eskom They fired him because he will not help them steal...:oops::oops::oops::oops::sanitizer::sanitizer::sanitizer::sanitizer: 
1:52:51,1:54:53, @Mokgadi Banda They wanted to appoint their chief enablers he was given benefits for doing nothing "@Fred Desrosiers It so relevant to show the Eskom board were a cabal and a very closed club purely feeding like parasites on eskom Malema looted limpopo. looted VBS.
