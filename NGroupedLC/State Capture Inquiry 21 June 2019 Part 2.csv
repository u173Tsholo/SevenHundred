6:36,12:02, thanks guys. so today its NW in the fray. this disease covered the whole country. no one is safe from this flu!!! corruption virus "@Lex Luger  I can't hear a thing will western cape also come to light since bosasa is also have contracts there? So Zuma want to play his delay tactics with the commission like he has been doing with the courts Wow if we do any government work we only get paid a year later. In the private geotechnical Sector and this common practice kills the private Industry. "@Kay Kay Of course "ah ah  the rain preceding the cold front just landed in cape town. it's gonna be heavy rains tonight in the mother city 
12:11,18:41, I am aware of many small to medium businesses that have folded because Government takes forever to pay for services rendered. @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ Don't say that around Adv Hofmeyr 😃 "@Thulani Bukani Yes This transcript is gonna be a mess. Can someone in charge of sound please look into it...can’t hear anything. Use the @SABC Digital News tag and ask them to sort it out. "@ Peter Pott. I can't recall Western Cape involved in BOSASA corruption. BOSASA merely used or bought their Fencing company "eish Prof mokgoro anything bosasa must be brought under microscope 
19:20,22:44, But the evidence never revealed corruption in this issue.. he is the one who wrote this letter they discussing Lot of corruption here from one corrupt comrades to another corrupt one. kuzoba lit. "I listened carefully "I think you'll all be deeply offended that we past the stage of even trying to find anyone clean within the ANC. I suggest it's like any brotherhood Yes - corrupt to the core Corruption exist "With respect to anyone in the ANC or with family in there 
23:37,28:52, The ANC cadres are as thick as thieves. All in it together. @Derek Main It's like looking into the heart of darkness and trying too find a virgin in a brothel Yes just like a pack of Hyenas Infact they are Hyenas It's something that was known by most thinking SAfns long before this commission. Only the ANC voters couldn't see it. say comrade phatudi "As a constitutional democracy we must waste time and money to give crooks an opportunity to defend themselves we got a very astute deputy chief justice here SA 
28:53,36:21, ayeye Difficult question to answer patudi @nhlanhla nkosi Kwavele kwashuba @peter pott Yes we do She is hiding something.Maybe I am wrong. @Derek Main From your mouth to the mouth of the gods! Line them all up & Fire!!! Yes I think she is contradicting herself as she states she knew there was something wrong with the Invoice but she paid it anyway. The DCJ has sharp brains... for lack of a better word It was servicing Luthuli House 
36:28,39:34, she is prepared. Only now before the judge she realise what a mess she got herself involved in The judge is the only bright mind in this part of the inquiry today.. @Born free You kill me. The most truth is told in jest. "make no mistake "@Margareth Waterboer You are so right!!! Cry the Beloved ""Cowntry""!!" Exactly @peter Pott.. GREED "@peter pott You may be right about the qualification That’s harsh Norman... "Yep 
39:40,43:57, "you are right This advocate is soft with her thats why the chair keeps on interupting to get clarity.This witness will be bad under cross-examination. But I agree 😀 "To be brutally honest @Mduduzi Thabede To the greater world these peeps tend to be the standard for how the rest of our kids are judged. I am sorry that she is so slow but how did she get ahead of better kids? @Peter pott the inventers of apartheid were intelligent look at their beneficiaries they are well of. @Tsepang Ranneileng You get the kind of lawyer you pay for. She's been poor every time she was leading.. She doesn't probe..only asks obvious questions as paperwork reveals.. Tsepang you are right.Something is not right with her performance. 
44:19,47:34, @peter pott Never underestimate the intelligence of apartheid thugs. those guys were smart. You dont keep such a system running when you are daft the corrupt peoples lawyers gonna take all the lootet money then nothing left of tax payers money massive downgrade from Hofmeyr so I disagree @Norman Zwane. Its got nothing to do with money. How did she even make it to the team @Hannes Prinsloo If the ANC cadres don't manage to steal it first. @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ .. and politicians. @Lex Luger you should check a video of Louis Theroux interviewing Eugene Terreblanche. the guy was very very very far from smart or intelligent apartheid is the system that in return could have resulted in huge death of a certain minority population . holding back from revolt by majority shouldn't be confused with stupidity She always start slow but I guess it’s because her witness is not up to the task I guess... 🤣 
48:12,54:21, "If you can believe IOL well said Peter @Anne M. Nope - don't believe a word IOL says - Iqbal has an agenda. That was a mistake ????? @Thulani Bukani No. Terreblanche was just a later day buffoon. We are talking of architects here. does this lady have any info "Norman I’m with you This is an unfair question "There it is 
54:31,1:00:36, boaring its like she is scared "@Khaya Nomoyi Like I said speak in setswana mama$😀😀ho thata fano "Zwane ayeye this seat is hot!!!! "@peter pott It's not a language issue. When you are hiding something "wait up until zuma speak in deep zulu Where have you heard of exco i.e political heads taking a a decision or recommendations as to whom a tender must be awarded... R50 million must come back 
1:01:05,1:09:51, Whatever happened to lifestyle audits for public officials? Supra must also come to the commission Translators will be made available...Zondo said so time ago for any other language used at the commission.. As these things are always done.. "and like in Oscars case @makhosi nobhatyi soon he will be talking to the media before they even ask him to come and testify "example Is anyone also suffering from Commission fatigue? @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ I thought you were also on a break because idiot's spam is still here. "I stopped commenting a long time ago 
1:10:20,1:13:51, @Magda Seguin It can be quite depressing at times. I like to watch some Trevor Noah to lift my spirits. I see my buddies are here all the time too Are we done for today? Go Pastor! "I watch animal videos "Yes @Anne.M what do you think of SONA? "I wasn't able to listen to all of it last night We had a 5 plus earthquake here in Western France 
1:14:06,1:20:10, Any damage at your place? "No These ladies are colour coded! Thank you Pastor JJ Pastor JJ 🙏 dumelang.. "I really feel for the DCJ and his team @Anne M. Yes - that's what's supposed to happen but we all know it doesn't. They get away with a slap on the wrist if caught out. Audits would lay bare the fact that they must be corrupt. "Ke gone ke gorogang This is getting complicated 
1:22:41,1:29:31, Ms Tlatsana definitely does not want to be at the commission. @Anne M its obvious I like the way how this lady is leading the proceedings ...no blunders unlike the previous...shes has done her home work very well somehow shes grilling them Som people despise Afrikaans but still use it everyday Lesufi is leading the pack against Afrikaans He is a racist "Racism will be the downfall of SA ANC and EFF...divide and rule 
1:30:50,1:34:18, @goolamv Where did you see that the commission is sitting tomorrow? @Goolamy: start at what time tomorrow "Okay SAA IS BANKRUPT. NO BANK WILL GIVE SAA ANYMORE MONEY. "@ Goolamy did Zuma appear today? SA is Junk status It's getting messy While most of the Zuma/Gupta acolytes are still in the SOEs they will cause havoc together with the Unions.CR didn't even mention disbundling of Eskom in his SONA as he previously promised 
1:34:19,1:36:56, "SAA She is a professional @goolamv thanks @Kearabetswe Ntsane No such luck. He's supposed to attend 15 - 19 July He buckled under pressure from the Unions to appease the Zuma faction in parliament this is koroneka.. her self.. BBBEE IS A RACIST POLICY Zuma was at court supporting his son in Bloem yesterday "SOMEONE 
1:37:09,1:39:29, typical tenderpreneur how did the trial go? PENSION FUNDS WILL BE LOOTED It was deferred to Sept I think hmmm the won't be a conviction there I bet Foes this lady have lawyers? She seems not to understand a contract *does The lady is a hustler Buy documents 
1:39:51,1:42:43, It was rebutted by other experts Blessed🤣🤣🤣🤣😋😋😋😋 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I am NOT Blessed🤗 This is amusing stuff so a defunct company with 3 employees amd zero experience except delivering meat is given a tender to facilitate immigration and transit administration of passengers "She's a street hustler "this tender system must be abolished it is safe haven for a lot of corruption "Red flag @Diana Sekatane What's the alternative? 
1:43:02,1:47:30, Koroneka will show state capture and mafia style gangsterism in action. Stealing by stealth a law abiding citizen's business to give it to the political gangsters. One can easily access government tenders on their website and the relevant email info to send it to government companies because people don't have jobs. "Supra is one of the Premier Team with Ace @Ben Cole totally correct She is much smarter then this its all part of her plan just to be on the safe side. A gmail account ? lame explanation by her so called business associate. Tender tendencies INVESTORS ARE PULLING OUT OF SOUTH AFRICA Supra Mahumapelo is implicated deeply She specifically mentioned Supra...listen 
1:48:14,1:50:50, Indeed Supra had been mentioned @Goolamv wait we are still in the beginning Supra is now a chairman of a parliamentary committee "Mark my words *going He will be fired wait magda Seguin thisla this lady is a hustler @makhosi nobhatyi Who is going to get fired? 
1:50:56,1:54:30, im lost what is this madam trying to say Shortlisted maybe but judging that Frolivk is also there among others tells you that they are regrouping We need to follow the evidence and not speed before it. If you see what Supra did in the NW your hair will stand on end...the health infrastructure is totally destroyed...that's just one example "@ Anne M Supra Mahumapelo Brian Tebogo Van Wyk has been heavily implicated by more than one witness so far. I like this witness. Painful to see how she was set up and how her dreams were usurped by crooks. The defunct Gupta health mobile unit that did zilch comes to mind The entire world can see that the SA population is paralysed by corrupt politicians 
1:55:11,2:00:04, @goolamv there's no smoke without fire @goolamv...check out the Gupta health mobile unit story for starters Or read up investigative publications of the premier league @carnoth ngomane I stopped using that saying after I experienced being a victing of a story that was manufactured about me. Victim "I know the inside story remember I worked closely with the NDOH @Mzalwane Mzala i get you but its usually the case the Chair is enjoying this There is also the new ambulances that never went on the road while people had no services... 
2:00:32,2:05:22, So am I enjoying this witness. One of the few who brings laughter by an otherwise somber affair. she does not want to take the fall for others NW was put on administration Exactly she is agrizing now Zuma still has all his allies firmly in place including the PP "Van Wyk "I think when the prosecutions start SAs will be so traumatised 
2:07:11,2:11:04, "They say SAs must become entrepreneurs but they get sucked in by corrupt politicians "i am baffeld by the scope of this state capture enquiry are we as a country already bankrupt this is scary out of the fact that this goverment just got another 5 years to continue with this crap "how can voters be so naive as to vote in the corupters again What a mafia style invasion of her CC who is next Boswell and wilky siecus sircus I supported PP Madonsela and I give the same support to PP Mkhwebane. The review process is a sound one. "Nepotism ty i just got in an heard the last witness shame she were abused 
2:11:14,2:21:42, This breaks my heart @Ben Cole maybe he thought this will never be revealed This is nonsense deal @Victor it's called corruption life partner?? I'm confused.. These witnesses sometimes they are really moving this commission at a snail pace. @Tsepang Ranneileng Van Wyk is gay and his life partner is a man Eish ! 😶 
2:22:18,2:23:41, The DCJ must get everything on the table as it will go on record for the courts...a snails pace is better to get the details than to rush and they go to court unprepared They are gay lovers "No No chair no. no no Zondo is precise "I picked it up immediately even gays were exercising state capture😨 they were bending for friends lol 
2:23:43,2:27:06, @Some guy 😁😁 SA Express was grounded due to all the mismanagement I think she is the original owner of Koroneka @Thando Nkutha Hello@Thando Nkutha. Ms Babadi Tlatsana "manipulation is a form of abuse "Greed knows no gender "this type of ""busness"" is normal in africa saam eet en saam steel" "SAA and SA Express must be sold She should have been given her affidavit first to refresh her memory. 
2:27:41,2:29:49, why did she sign without reading 😭 Yes Danie.. it would seem that corruption is the order of the day in S A. "Normally all witnesses have their a copy of their affadavits I never read either 😱. thanks Pastor 🙋 "you will sign your soul away "The mafia uses coercion i have been in a minimum sort of state scam dealing with a previous disadvantage contracter for fencing in a small town village and do the sub contracting for him and what a sham it was(tbc) agree Magda 
2:30:06,2:32:43, "She trusted government and parastatal officials You can't win something that is not in a competition. Seguin they do consult with the evidence leaders to refresh their memory before the start of the proceedings "i did the work and did it well but the material suplied from the ""boss"" was sub standerd i asked him about it and was told to do what i signed to do and that was fencing etc (tbc)" Is Mr Van Wyk black or white because I heard Tebogo Brian Van Wyk When this ho yo court any judge worth their salt will see right through the Ban Wyk coercion tactics ehh lekgowa is our for blood A witness rendered to Van Wyk as being very dark "Skin colour doesn't matter 
2:32:56,2:35:05, you must never sign without legal representative @Danie Nilsen Have you told the municipality (or whoever issued the work) that you were given sub-standard material to work with? "This lady was naive This witness looks familiar.. has she ever been a member of Parliament or in the government?? "Eish "at the first inspection from bloemfontein public works they were surprize to meet me and doing the work as they knew me from former work have done as a subcontractor the lady was used as very badly. "I dont think so Bicyor @Victor 
2:35:46,2:39:19, It was a CC!! for goodness sake it was a catering company!! yooooo🤦 "@Danie Nilsen Okay @Anne M. yes at the first inspection and showed the results of measurments i took and the contractor was absent on that meeting. long story short he got 21 day site vacation It doesn't seem like she was a sophisticated business person as she applied for small tenders with only one or two people assisting as employees. the township kind thing Such ignorance shouldnt have given her the business deal This witness is not as ignorant as she is making out to be. Always rushing....there you have a strategy of coercion right there She could have handed Corineca over to Van Wyk. 
2:39:27,2:42:35, @Victor...she was used and abused "that's true... seems like the ""African style"" coz there's usually no one checking. suddenly chief Zondo is here to check 😰😨😱" love them all but trust no one "and i finished the work with the same material and got paid the outstanding contract as a matter of fact there was no shenigans as it is now Van Wyk saw an opportunity to use a person who have a registered business that did not really have work. Even the big tender was suggested by Mr Van Wyk. "@Victor this is how criminals work *Ponzi schemes Van Wyk inserted himself into her business and directed everything That is not how tenders work 
2:42:36,2:44:40, "@Danie Nilsen It might cost you some work in future But who is this van Wyk guy? Is this witness a volunteer or was she supeoned?? Van Wyk was from SA Express There are many registered businesses out there by people who had dreams but could not get work. He was General Manager Commercial at SA Express You are right @Anne M his name was mentioned with the grounding of SA Express But the Deputy Chief Justice is asking some tough questions that make this lady's story very shaky. How do you just sign coz you trust someone? Even if my wife were to bring me something I'd check it I want to listen to her recordings of Van Wyk 
2:45:11,2:46:53, lol it did cost me some short time but then an coulerd friend asked me to become his partner as we were in the same type of construction. i think it was the only time a white partner I can understand why my luggage had been tampered with 🤤 Please trust your wife @Lex Luger my wife makes me sign documents in my sleep. Read my lips @Lex Luger criminals go for the vulnerable and those who are not aware of their rights.According to her he was in authority and she believed and trusted him implicitly @some guy... haha Insurance policy yep as I said lol oh yeah. This poor women was taken advantage of. 
2:46:58,2:49:11, "Read between the lines Guys you can't even trust your mother's daughter/son. Listen to the deputy chief justice's questions. This lady is not as naive as she is making out He is an effing criminal I am getting so angry now poor lady man 💔 "got in as a bee partner my senior was coulerd person in the company up to this day i still do not get it right and he was on the state procurement list and i was not on the list This lady is stammering now. Her story is not convincing. Under thorough cross examination she will fumble @Lex Luger you need to learn discernment and analytical skills rather than criticising the witness Any fool can hear that this lady was conned 
2:49:19,2:51:10, Thanks @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ I can never be as naive as this lady esp when doing business. She thinks she is so likeable van Wyk just liked her so much It's all fishy @Magda Seguin Just listen to the deputy chief justice. There is an experienced lawyer there. Not you and I The DCJ must ask pertinent questions to protect her when it goes to court sounds like a classic scam @Lex Luger you dont know my background.Sit down Exactly it's a monumental scam Her only experience is as a subcontractor in delivering meat. Did she ever get a construction tender? This lady sees the trouble she is in and she decides let me make it van Wyk's story. It's pretty much like me trusting you guys. I don't know you. You could be killers. 
2:51:21,2:53:12, trust is deadly hey Trust leafs Lex😂😂😂😂😂😂 The crookery and deceit goes beyond any bounds of reason. Naitivity and blind trust in people of authority at any level had got us where we are today. @Lex Luger it's your perogative but dont make assumptions on who we are Trust leads to Betrayal @goolamv you are right Indlala this lady is acting dumb.......she knew what she was getting into...i 
2:53:20,2:54:44, well I'm not a killer...... or am I😏 @Magda Seguin You misunderstand me. All I am saying is that it is imprudent to trust a stranger. Just like those ladies who hand their babies to strangers at taxi ranks and the strangers run. It seems like she was being pushed under pressure and the cotract was lucrative. "I work with people everyday of my life in their most intimate lives she puts her foot in it she opens her mouth keep it very short and mostly yes or no R31 million "GREED! The hallmark of all tenderpreneurs! She was just interested in making easy money @Magda Seguin You are obviously not after unearthing truth but defending the witness. "These tenders are usually millions 
2:55:16,2:57:52, I am impartial but I can see a scam a mile away GREED leads us into scams! The contract is more than R 400m "Some people in SA always defends corruption "@Magda Seguin I am worried why this lady did not see it. I also would not sign even what a colleague hands me A HUSTLER IS NEVER THIS NAIVE Semantics @Lex Luger THIS HUSTLER HAS BEEN BUSTED No...she is acting like she's naive...... 
2:58:02,2:59:48, She didnt even know how she was going to be paid. Easy picking for a half baked lawyer "I just came online but I can tell this woman is confused Whatever @Lex Luger "@Derick Mampuru She is not confused She can Bank the millions in her account but can’t read the contract. "@Lex Luger  Who knows whether she recieved the millions? Why is she here? @Magda Seguin Is she your connection? Were you also in the scam? They will arrest you!! I think she playing games. 
2:59:58,3:00:50, "Her business was identified The agmt was envisaged to move R400 million out of North West gvnmt into SA Express and a third party that SA Express nominated to conduct ground-handling services at those airports named Koroneka. @Lex Luger lol I thought she doesn't know what she's talking about... 🤣🤣🤣🤣 look at her glasses lol @Thando Nkutha ...spot on...she's acting dumb.. "This needs to be put in context R97 million of that amount was paid out of the North West government and siphoned off through a “detailed scheme of money laundering” ooohhh uhuh She is trying to avoid jail. Arrest me? Dont patronise me 
3:01:00,3:03:40, "@Derick Mampuru Exactly No no Chair......she knows.... She’s lying😂😂 Contracts equal money for nothing. "@Anne M your friend @Lex Luger needs to read and be informed about this commission and why it exists typical tenderpreneur. just signs documents and waits for easy ANC millions The players are all connected. She is acting naive She is lying.... @Tsepang Ranneileng ...spot on Bra... 
3:03:52,3:05:21, this woman is presenting the front of ignorant. She totally knew the guys where using her company and she was going to get a share without her physically doing to day-to-day stress of doing business @Magda Seguin Unfortunately I am illiterate. I can't read or write. Happy Now? Yes you won!! That R400m was stolen She said she’s done construction tenders for government before. and supplied meat I don't think she ever won a big tender like construction. "okay let me listen some more they knew through that hence they just wanted to use her company She had two companies what were tendering for government contracts 
3:05:35,3:07:11, Please Chair .......she's playing you...... Kunjalo Thando she probably even right the proposal herself write* The only reason she agreed is because this system worked before. Yes🤣🤣 She is what is called a 'patsy' the fall guy for malicious purposes Vuka mawulele When you supp with the devil you must use a long fork. 
3:07:47,3:10:23, @Thando Nkutha my point exactly lol ultimately she was told for every money that comes into your account you get x-percentage She had a drive and van loader for her meat delivery in hospitals later end up with close a half a billion. Pathetic "Liar "@Mzalwane Mzala It is this belief @Zola Pinda That is exactly the issue "This woman is lying. She should have had relations with the then Premier and was co-corrupt @Lex Luger I get you. Yes 
3:10:41,3:13:00, "A blessee thinks she is so lucky R400m no contract 😣😣 Many people who work in government find themselves in such relationships. A break at 6? What time are they adjourning? This is very sad for us as tax payers. These looters must go rot in jail @Thando Nkutha I like this slender but would have loved Maleka or Hofmeyer you will now see how quick the money was exiting her account to show she was just a conduit "With all this going on 
3:13:08,3:15:12, This old Judge deserves a Bells !!! I mean...it is 6 o clock already ON A FRIDAY !!! 😀😀 WOW this lady is unbelieble clever or naive Very clever @HERCULAAS KRUGER You are absolutely right. This judge's work ethic is absolutely wonderful. He was in parliament yesterday and he is making up for it today. Where are our parliamentarians today? why was she in business? To loot @Danie Nilsen This lady would sell her soul and her grandmother's feet for a pound!!! "From the start of this commission it is very clear how peoples lives were destroyed by the Zuptoids they had a specific strategy.People used 
3:15:15,3:23:42, Absolutely Lex !!!! We need more of his type in our country !!! If you are not on the side of justice you are complicit @Magda Seguin There you go with your erudite platitudes Check how JZ operated: Give a senior job to a person who will know that they would have never got it without your intervention. Such a person agrees to everything you say she said she signed for millions eish man throw me a Belss and one for the chair too This lady knew that she owed Van Wyk for that contract and could not question him. @Pastor JJ Pastor JJ 😁😁😁😁😁 rhetoric @Thando Nkutha I don't think she was consciously being criminal but she let go of ethics in order to get the big money. Unfortunately for her she was dealing with a bigger tsotsi. "i think she knew what she was getting into 
3:23:55,3:29:04, "i d not know i know how to spend and more She was used and she allowed herself to be used. Lesson: Always follow processes. Exactly "watch the eye play she is doing and the soft tone as she says ""yes chair""" .. kwaaks "Code of conduct Short cuts are dangerous. 
3:29:21,3:33:30, Wow... these people are hard workers. They are only adjourning now? My worry is that she is not given protection when she talks about lift home. STEM SAAM JOU ...DANIE !! "Thats not South African "i know ground handling  "Oh she is going to have a horrable week end sipping bells and practice for monday yes lets go Seems information is all she lacked.
