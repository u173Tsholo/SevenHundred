time,11:30,message ms dlamini related to dr nkosazana dlamini Are you asking or stating a fact? asking you @Anne M😃 I don't know. Dlamini is quite a common surname in KZN. Revenue improvement by SAA ??? Just from vetting alone? hahahah please please please please in light of her testimony let the eskom employees be vetted to increase renue 
11:30,12:38, She just made that up. She can't back it up The judge has had it with this lady😂😂😂🤣 😂😂😂 😀😂 Just jail this woman He's totally fed up kkk "this witness is not that smart hey but she's being blamed for things that she is not responsible for 
12:44,14:38, This aunti’s comments will not help Zondo. Her idea of higher turnover at SAA is shocking. Forget about building a nation SAVE our nation from fools like this funny thing is that some SAA executives and possibly Gov officials believe her "chair already has an opinion on her I would have been in tears by now if I were here I am now convinced that this is a 20% Graduate. No doubt whatsoever This lady reminds me of SARS protect me from yourself executive I am sorry to say but Ms Dlamini is wasting the Commission's time She's trying to protect Dudu's decision to do the vetting that used iffy questions 
14:43,15:42, they vetted the pilots and turnover went up😂😂😂😂. Moerskont well now we know why we have such useless people in SOEs if she is the one vetting these ones that worry about there nails more than there jobs are really scary..just lik PP Mkwebane @ - agree there is simply NO way this tart has an MBA! Dudu needs to be in orange overalls sje's skipping pages using those kong nails.. The Gupta's initiated this so they can figure out who will be a treat "How do they do there everyday ""work"" with nails lik that? do they really go to their offices to work?" 
15:42,17:10, Total incompetence and misguided Findings were that Dudu got hold of intensely private information on her managers. @Mbizo Slash Dudu definitely needed to know where the threats were. Why is this lady lying for Mashobo? that former minister how do people text with the nails? happily taking a salary for 16 years at the SSA This lady did her job according to a mandate and information she was given. She analysed her findings according to verbal conversations. @funicanz - . I don't think she's lying All the Elite studied at the same Uni..........and great brainwashing success........ 
17:11,18:38, incompetent with a master's degree. so the university must be useless as well she's over a barrel there were no risks period. @Dominic Przybylski..It is called Dunning-Kruger Effect.. @Jacqui Baumgardt Between a rock and a hard place. She doesn't want to cross Dudu Myeni. How com the Zulu guy yesterday never stammered or stuttered around..he was crisp and clear? whos lying is sooo clear I hope the vetting included stool sampling also.. @ - agree "@Jacqui Baumgardt  
18:53,20:54, On that passing her masters dilema we have. I've seen people with no knowledge at all getting their degrees off other student's hard work. Students are encouraged to work in groups "Unprepared but not defensive Grossly unfair "Jacqui Myeni is under two buses now @Jabu Malinga She probably doesn't want death threats. why does she look to her right every now and then. is it because he lawyer is giving her signs Zondo is gatvol now According to SteenHuizen - there will be no arrests before next year. 
20:56,22:17, "ahhh this lady @Ishaad Mohammed Somebody is giving her signs "Jacqui "sad thing about this stAte capture it focus on small fish  @Dominic - not before the Commission completes its work. I can see a great exodus to states that cannot send these people back How can somebody in state security be so naive? @Anne M I am certain of that she flips the hair😀 she is annoyed now shame "Dudu 
22:28,23:42, "But I guess u need the small fish to bring down the big fish tell us the great success ms Dlamini please fake her thats why she cant think Geeez........remember one thing....all the birds of a feather flock and studied together....true ne........ @fuzile dazana I think all the small fish will lead to the big fish this is the result of appointment on basis of race What kind if great success is this?? mmm even the worst fool can see that she's lying i dont think we will find big fish is in cuba 
24:11,24:57, Dudu is hiding under a rock - no court appearances dlamini is missing the point here please give her chance to think more about I believe there is a whole shoal of big fish Big fish are in Cuba and Dubai - only sardines left here. on the turn - come on DCJ Eeeesh...there some big fish in Zumatjie Fire Pool....... there is no way you forget to put all your paper /memo work she lies I think this is one of the worst witnesses so far 
25:49,27:22, she must take out the nails mybe she will know the success Corrupt government human resources departments and the UNIONS are the reason why this country is stuffed. i think she did not prepared well but she defense her self.she has to have more reports "Jacqui @Jabu Malinga - she was acting on orders "Sthakathi "Jacqui she must speak the truth or this day will be like 10yeas "@Jacqui Baumgardt  
27:23,28:16, Is this chop still talking Bull "Whenever i was pulled in to lead a project the first question I asked was ""Why are you doing this?"" The first answer is almost always a lie. Project cannot succeed if leader doesn't know truth." the problem is like the advocate the other day - explaining only makes it worse But there was corruption nje Telll her DCJ.....nail this Gucci one... Pilots association would never allow this intuition Im sorry but Vetting will stop stop the looting "Eish  After our DCJ told that lawyer to sit down it looks like he has adopted a much stronger approach with witnesses. 
28:30,29:06, she is annoying I'm sorry this witness don't no that she did wrong to approve the wrongdoers "what's wrong with this witness Sorry will NOT STOP THE LOOTING Vetting does not stop corruption.. arrests stop corruption to approve the wrong doers @Carryn Meredith Vetting in this case seems to have been to get private info on subordinates to used for intimidation. EEEsh....she's now being cheeky........geeez 
29:08,30:42, "seems to be have been brain washed DCJ is gatvol You accelerate corruption there "@Jabu Malinga would someone rip those nails off her paws please I used to do vetting its a simple backround check on credit and crim she is playing dumb She is yet to explain what was successful about her vetting project that she was asked to vet pilots. not answering the question 
30:52,31:57, it didn't Hof The Boobie brothers sings a great song called WHAT A FOOL BELIEVES. Dedicated to her Cadre deployment yhoo True... Ill bet that we TAX payers were charged a crazy amount to do vetting when it really costs R75pp "@Carryn Meredith Dudu Myeni used the ""vetting process"" for her own agenda tell her Adv Hofmeyr Ok so the whole exersise was a waist of time and money 
31:59,32:58, Exactly... I love Miss Hoff....... Kate my Kate I like Kate Ms Hofmeyr ❤️💕 Kate for President!! Hofmeyr is right. Dlamini can't say vetting was reducing risks when they actually DON'T fire those who don't get a PASS she was deployed bt dudu to do her dirty job What nonsense is this woman saying. Shoooooooo 
33:01,33:54, Geeeeez....this one is really doff....or acting it.. You would ask them nicely to leave... And Zondo as her deputy Was used to figure out who can be INCLUDED in corrupt activities. agree Listening to this lady really hurts. I don't know why I'm still here Spot on @Dominic Przybylski she was used now she s under the bus Thank you all for the wonderful and sweet sentiments extended to my Fiancee Kate. I will share your thoughts with her this evening. 
33:54,35:21, yes "@ Mashikinya I'm here for the Kate vetting of the big fish behind the little fish @Pastor J ur welcome sir 😀😀😀😀 @fuzile dazana if she was placed to do dirty work and what is coming out of her mouth she deserves every bit she gets Totally pointless exercise Why do you did vetting if there would be no measures miss Dlamini yesssssseeeeessss this woman is weak - how was she vetted herself? "Pastor J 
35:28,36:51, @Padtor J u can have ms myeni or memela🤣🤣🤣 indeed carryn Because Dudu instructed her to @makhosi nobhatyi I did not receive the refund yet@Person of interest it's on its way Pastor I gave Memela to Elvis @Immanuel How can you say that you can not dismiss someone for Crim backround UTTER BULL S*&%^ This is looting at the highest order - worse by a young woman who can still prosper in life so vetting was used to to get rid of people. ms myeni was she ever vetted? 
36:52,38:48, is it me or does the witness sound like she's related to Bathabile Dlamini? @Pastor J🤣🤣🤣🤣 Surely if they do the vetting they should be fully informed as to what the law regarding vetting does and dies not say. @Carryn Meredith - 100% "She has a ring on her left hand It must be hard to do a decent job when the hyenas are circling People wonder why not all university graduates are employable? I think the testimony of this lady and the advocate head of procurement at SAAT enlightens me. "If she is not a lawyer This chick has a Masters degree 
38:52,41:40, university is overrated. about time people woke up to this. 👍 @Anne but they speak similar "Yes Do as your corrupt ANC masters tell you break our laws @rosalind 🙌 The ANC think they are the Law.........true ne There biro paper mate may have to match like or as do we Com on guys this is not a matter of having a degree or not. She is worried that she could implicate herself. Any person would buckle under pressure if they are hiding something @MIKE DURBAN The ANC think they are the state. 
42:08,45:39, She says DMini If this is what we hear about things beyond the year 2000 what do we not know?????????/ now she is in Port @Mbizo Slash she does not know what she is talking about "....The head of the ANC is Medusa "She is too ordinary and rather shallow for someone with a masters degree.What university did she go to?Probably paid lecturers for grades 😂😂😂 Masters degree in nail polish Seasonal or Tempt. Combo Work 
47:08,49:59, classified she said?

57:18,58:35, what attitude she has!! ms Dlamini has never been challenged on what she thinks or believes no matter how wrong There are presceibed ways of handeling classified documents in your posession. Surely she was not asked to speculate of current staff following policy ? SA have this woman fired from her job because she is ...... you fill out the blanks. She's obfuscating because she's hopelessly out of her depth sipho the xing science also says that morons are dangerous with a gudget in their hands This one sure has an Entitlement mindset........i reckon..
