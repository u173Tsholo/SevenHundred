37:28,44:03, Zuma chomie "I don't think all is done for nothing R13456788347 million ten thousand five hundred nd seventy two ram you are correct Gladys @Gladys Nombewu i agree with you you need evidence based prosecution not vendetta based one cause it will backfire There you go. First lie. Morning people African Refuge true 
44:50,48:01, morning peeps... gosh this is going to be a long day🙄 "This people should just b treated like criminals that is why commission must be thorough not Rush Rush even this enquiry is used to steal money of this country "so in a ""he said yes very true "@African Refuge i hear you They never recall anything. this white lady looks more focused. 
48:04,51:13, all lies no exciting news .can't remember all these politicians must be arrested period Ready and waiting my brother@Elvis Malakoane can someone please remind me why we are having this commission again??? nothing will come from this!!! This is a commission of Amnesiacs. Van Loggerenberg just to fool us stupid voters nt to remove them coming election.Nothing will happen to those criminals enquiry of justified stealing "I'm having a problem with people who keep coming on here @anya van loggerenberg this commission will recommend that a FORENSIC investigation be undertaken into State Capture 
51:32,54:21, Morning wait and see when this commission finishes and all He'll breaking loose Corrupt people are ridiculing it for their own agenda @Kabelo Katjedi agree they will go scot free You are absolutely right people are so negative They can't remember anything except when they getting paid anya van loggenberg this commission will help that is why it is led by educated people not Guptas "@Robert Russell yes i know thats what we hope for but will it really happen I wonder how much has been spent on this enquiry? we must wonder how much was stolen not how we spent to fix 
54:24,56:07, I wonder how much has been spent on corruption:/ @anya van loggerenberg ...Please enlighten us all. What is the basis for your views that this is a smokescreen.? as we speak more than R40 000 000 @Sam_Q Mbanjwa .....the last I read the cost was R253 MILLION on the enquiry I am not sure on corruption Pastor j some people like derailing us to find the truth by critiquing this commission mornig they stole everything didnt even leave coim coins 
56:17,1:00:40, The money spent on this commission could be recovered by the successful prosecution and attachment of assets of 1 corrupt official. So lets not get hung up by such small things @Elvis Malakoane ....That is so true Bianca Arnold morning Bianca @Pastor J believing that something is being done but no one will do anything to bring criminals too book "@Bianca Arnold He said that he was dismissed The NPA has already said as a fact that they have prepared charge sheets with evidence coming from this Commission. Lets give it a chance @anya van loggerenberg Jommy Manyi did name dropping and lies @ Pastor J ​ The NPA will pursue charges. @Pastor J i know we have to be patient but our patience is running low we need to see some action!!! this process is going too slow 
1:00:42,1:03:58, @Phillip Cwazibe They have said that and committed to that already. Adv Hermine Cronje has been appointed totall for that task. @ Bianca Arnold he said he discussed with Ms Oliphant the removal of another minister. Another lie Advocate Kate Hoffmeyer is so professional and well prepared...... if ever I needed a Advocate it would be her for sure..... "I don't even want to hold my breath anya van loggenberg Soon something will happen from NPA and the HAWKS I have trust in the current NDPP "@Pastor J Most people here comment based on their emotions not facts @Robert Russell she is amazing a breath of fresh air @ Robert Russell ​ Advocate Kate Hoffmeyer is always clear and follows all her arguments/questions in a logical manner. Nice 
1:04:09,1:08:27, @Elvis Malakoane i hope you are right but yes we have to stay positive difficult as it seems @Mshika Mshika ...Yes you are right. I also understand peoples frustrations particularly when corruption was evident and no action during those dreaded 9years@anya van loggerenberg correct Anya She has already implicated Jimmyboy Manyi in Perjury and lying under oath. Pastor J ​ She has already implicated Jimmyboy Manyi 5 times by now. "@Pastor J people must also note that we a dealing with a network of criminals not individuals " @Mshika Mshika ...That is a brilliant assessment of the status quo of the situation. Well said this criminals don't even take this inquiry serious 
1:08:37,1:13:21, LEd Bulps that machine will give up "This is just a waste of state funds. We all know the perpetrators are high profile political figures " "It makes no sense for them to come here and lie. Obviously these advocates follow-up on everything. And Ms Hoffmeyer is busy repeating the question of the letter how many prosecutions have started by this man of action rhamaphosa since he has said a " Overland over again he is a man of action then he is astounded by the lack of investment I don't think Ms Oliphant is a lier I think she is going to throw jimmy under the bus @LED BULPS ...Lie Detector tests are done on a voluntary basis only and cannot be imposed otherwise. Also it is not seen as evidential material in a Court process. 
1:13:29,1:18:49, Elvis no busses here only Mercedes Benz tea with curry served by uncle tony yes it is so Bianca " @ Elvis Malakoane ​I Indeed Ms Oliphant is not a lier. Mr Manyi is already under the bus and sort of direct to the back wheels. @LED BULPS ...Evidence from Affidavits only must be lead by additional evidence being led and subjected to scrutiny. Otherwise it is useless like Zuma saying I will send an affidavit but not be questi questioned about it under cross examination. " @LED BULPS ...Mostly yes...but implicated parties may be forced to do so via a Subpoena if they dont do so voluntarily 
1:19:38,1:36:23, " @LED BULPS ....Because it has never ever been certified to be 100% reliable anywhere in the world. @LED BULPS ...Even speed cameras have been successfully interrogated in court and cases where won. " It is what it is unfortunately @LED BULPS so Raddy Direko wants to cross examine former President and former President is opposing the application --That is telling for a character Jimmy manyi is a liar but I really don't believe Manyie told Lies.. " 
1:37:00,1:43:46, And so say all of us @Marcus Levack jimmy lied and name dropped " Zuma must come back and lie more he will avoid as much as possible I feel that this Aunty is not telling the truth. She needs to tell us that she was asked by the Gupta's and Zuma to appoint him after he was dismissed and she was appointed a Minister. "This people r given weeks to prepare their lies before appearing in commission @Kabelo Katjedi Stop being paranoid "Yes 
1:44:00,1:47:46, @Pastor J ... not a truer word spoken! " "Gupta yes! "Mbuso thats how it is  pastor j so she is ether lying or delaying the truth This Aunty is lying and that is the end of my story on her. @Elvis Malakoane Lying and passing the buck it seems. " 
1:47:48,1:50:06, Nobody lies to Kate Hofmeyer "Yazz “Corrupt politicians make the other ten percent look bad.”Henry Kissinger What I love about Hofmeyer is that is you are misleading her she will fork it out of your smaller nyana conscious!! Minister is struggling here "If a hearing is pending an investigation I will be disappointed because she does not come across as a lier but now she flip flopping mama oliphant seems to be contradicting herself Lol hahahaha Judge is coming to the rescue of Minister 
1:50:26,1:54:42, "I think she's struggling @Bianca Arnold agree..as a YES person.. " Adv my Adv ! Wemmah! manyi is a criminal I hope I don’t eat a girlfriend like Adv Hofmeyer — the women sticks to her acts shame!! 🔥🔥🔥 I have so much respect for this judge 
1:54:49,1:59:11, Zondo sometimes kodwa.. "Wii Granzier @Sithakhathi###Advocate is not Avocado. Eating an Advocate? Adv Hofmeyr is always prepared Am loving Adv Hofmeyr Diwi The Doer I meant “get” not eat and facts instead of act — typos chief😅 " Hola Lady Elephant is fumbling now. 
1:59:42,2:02:21, "joh these people never take accountability. its always :"" Legal services told me Since when has Oliphant been equal to Elephant? They are now calling her appointment to account - state capture inquiry izokunyisa hehe "Let's not disrespect abantu abadala la fool reasons "The question is " "@Rob Nel ...The answer to your question lies with the Gupta's @Bianca Arnold I agree. Or they know their job very well and intentionally broke procedure. Now they claiming incompetence in order to escape liability. 
2:03:56,2:06:08, "Cadet deployment because of struggle credentials - a serious problem in the country as some people feel entitled to anything The new incumbent then simply rubber stamps a corrupt decision and gives it a veneer of legitimacy!!!!! Fool information??? "I thingyou meant ""Cadre"" @Sthakathi Khumalo . Cadets are in the Navy" """ I was going to"" lol sorry that doesn't count" think you @Sthakathi Khumalo The problem is the ANC in our country n we all must work together to remove it. "Pastor J "Even Mama Oliphant was not competent 
2:06:10,2:09:52, @Sthakathi Khumalo ...You are forgiven...hahahahaha Pastor J — 😝😝😝 "CJ Zondo DCJ Zondo 😀😁😂 @Bianca Arnold Where did you get the brick joke?...its killing me 😂😂🤣 Ndlovu eNkulu.. 🙏 Our problem is that currently the ANC is using colour (white n black) to divide us loot more n destroy our country "When the questions get hot - you often hear 
2:10:17,2:12:42, @Bianca Arnold But I was also told a long time ago to plant a few feathers and.........are you telling me my dearly departed and much loved and sometimes annoying granny was lying.hahahaha @Makwa Choma it is not the ANC that is corrupt. The people in the positions of trust Hello all I missed you guys. Ah I see Ms Hoffmeyer is back!! @Brendan Rampath ...Welcome back thanks Sir this commission continues to fuel racism.

2:16:04,2:18:06, The finance manager at Eskom who testified - he is white and he had Ms hoffmeyer as well. Imagine you’ve come to testify and then also your deployment is called into question - this commission will chow you!! "Yes Rosalind or put a bag over it 🤣 no man ms oliphant doesnt know what she is answering @Eliot Chauke ...No more nonsense today ok baba? we still want to love you "Hai Pastor

"You have to help me When the questions are too hot to handle – You often hear repeat the question hehe Ms Oliphant out of her depths. She keeps staring at the ceiling before attempting to answer questions. @Person of interest ...Go for it. I will pray for forgiveness afterwards....hehehehehe "All along we had this sort of leaders 😁 @Mphedululo Mudau lol you only realising that now 🤣🤣 Is she still in cabinet mama Oliphant??

She suitable to be a retired Sangoma not a minister shame ANC person of interest Ohk I see I am doing that The one from that news organisation that we dare not name. Yes @Sam Monkoe.

We all kmew that there was corruption "The greedy CIC must come testify if he wholeheartedly want to assist the commission

I suggested Solitary confinement.Anybody agrees with me?" Uyaxoka lo mama how can you not search what was charged for? How did you withdraw those charges? 
2:34:55,2:35:51, @Mbuso Ndlovu I have a feeling that he will be more civil. Zuma must suffer he brought this country to its knees 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂as the public do you think they will allow us in for a drink😂😂🍻🍷 She wants to disappear hehe "Yes Pastor 🤔 Pastor Olifant We will make him suffer @Lorraine Naidoo . You have any hot chillies in the garden? we should invite the states legal services to the commission. because everyone seems to get bad/state capture enabling advice from the state's legal team

2:43:26,2:45:48, @pastor j what do make of the sangoma killings and the farmer to be a sangoma something very wrong there "@Elvis Malakoane .. There is a deep message in her quoting those scriptures. She seems to intimate ""if only I knew better then""" At least she should have brought Briyani like Hlaudi LED BULPS after this verse now you evidence? @Danie Nilsen That is sickening. Like any other killing. But some strange things are happening in that environment. I am being diplomatic or a backlash will come quickly pastor j yes that what i thought " I hear you The state is still captured 
2:46:13,2:49:41, @pastor j to something evil got into the whole thing satanic or at least demonized first for us here @Danie Nilsen ... I have been told that a lot lot worse happening in that environment but this is being highlighted because of the people involved. Makes sense? These appointees of ministers compromised their decision to suit state capture We need Malema and Shivambu up there. VBS looters. @Person of interest you need to take your pills... its time🙏 he sounds a bit like Zondo Mmusi Maimane next EFF leader? Mmusi is forming his own party.😂 i visited an sangoma in glencoe kzn many years ago he was a white sangoma and had many cultures as patients he gave me muti for deafness and now at 65 i can still hear
