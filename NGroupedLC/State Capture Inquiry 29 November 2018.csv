24:49,27:01, bantu men must STOP bein lazy WHAT A RESUME!!!! "I like how this enquiry is focussed only on the last 10 years.

Oppressors were wrestled and defeated only for the country to be handed over to the Guptas. @makhosi true! Fils needs urgent psychological help. He is seeking attention in the wrong places. I think (s)he grew up as a homeless orphan who was deprived of parental affection and attention. 
34:19,38:16, "He needs professional help from a psychologist as a matter of urgency. Guys Investigation of state capture should start on the year of negotiations codesa 1&2 or earlier than that. "@ Thando Nkutha hey ANC was divided that more corrupt people were most vocal and powerful When is Zuma and Zuma Jnr appearing before the commission? "Yes Thando "@Mokoko Zuma is running away when is Zuma and Son appearing @mokoko zuma is too busy with other Court cases HE HAD TO INTERVENE 
38:31,40:25, Cyril won't do anything to japardise next years elections because he wants to be president 1st then we will see his real colours @makhosi nobhatyi i remember when they would say they going to lead till jesus come or say to their members it is cold outside of ANC.... cocky ANC zuma is running away "Why are these advocates busy with other cases at the same time Cherly?

"there are still honest people in the ANC who can propel our country to higher heights "@Frans Phala. The ANC seems so have disdain against members with tertiary education! For some reason "Why government still thinks owning 4 airlines (SAA So this one is here to press her thumb on Malusi Gigagaba and Dudu myeni Zuma.. Next "mnqobi we gave it to them 
1:02:22,1:09:01, Gov doesnt own Airlink "Tebogo Khaas You will never see that "@Job Mokolutlo Probably because of Zuma's ""clever blacks"" narrative" the guptas are billioneres and yena is a nkandlanere Grigamba grigamba💩💩💩💩💩 @washington nzira You know Cherly's evidence is rich and interesting but the camera keeps on showing me the distraction "I also want to do business with SAA today is Gigaba @Louis Eloff get the ANC membership card first as protection then you can milk the cow 
1:09:35,1:14:57, Hahahaha Frans 😂 Frans Phala His son is the youngest billionaire in the country "Its veri easy Louis... Just submit a written Bullsh#t plan to the ANC on how to milk a cow. they will definitely accept Don't give away ANC secrets "We await with great anticipation the submission of Gigaba in this inquiry @skhakathi yes his educated SON not jacob zuma. "I am just trying to make you understand that nkandlane is small thing The bums on the seats... Cherly Carolus?? 
1:15:03,1:20:12, zondo is getting Aviation education today Zondo couldn't wait to jump off his seat. SAA customers are reffered to as the bums on the seats... @Sthakathi Khumalo he is going to spend most of it in court. ( hopefully ) Do we know which witnesses are impli6 implicated? "At the rate the ANC has messed up the SOEs "Sad to say ...otherwise the outcome will not be significant in the greater scheme of things. 
1:21:56,1:35:39, Lets all those implicated go to jail it will be a wastfull expenditure if they only tell us how it happened and without any actions taken against the perpetrators tea time @Thembeka hi @Mnqobi Mdlethse credible witnesses need to come forward otherwise this commission is going nowhere. sorry I got ur surname wrong Viva EFF viva @Solly 12 EFF = Fascists ➡️Sideline comment: If EFF helps poor white people I will give them more consideration 🤔 Is her name Cherly or Cheryl 
1:36:42,1:40:36, let EFF take over Africa fo Africans... "📣Fun Fact: ""Hypocrisy is the contrivance of a false appearance of virtue or goodness there are poor white people in SA?? mmh what happened Ask Mbeki ✔ "He acknowledged that it was a mistake of government not to address increasing white poverty in 2004 already after all that white previledge 😥😥 i doubt 
1:40:46,1:43:20, White privilege only applies to those who abused whiteness @Noreply Internet Cheryl Poor whites wasted their whiteness 😪😪😪😪 "✔2004: We welcomed President Thabo Mbeki's recognition that poverty among whites had increased in the last 10 years white people i know are all rich may be if ur confusing them with coloured people... at least they know now how black people have been suffering Only rich whites can do business with government 😜 True @Solly 12 So only black should be poor!!!? 
1:43:42,1:47:02, There is time for everything EFF + some white people = solution. #StopRacism Louis Eloff hopefully we can agree on the land question There is a growing divide between poor and rich whites Maybe if we all see each other as South Africans not colour "I have no land sorry Solly So to between poor and rich black people @Louis Eloff "@Louis Eloff your statement is bothering me my guy @Ntuthuko I'm in 
1:47:26,1:49:22, True @Frans Phala @Louis..You say EFF are racist?..I'll tell u something they are NOT racist..Name one racist thing they have said? "@Frans Cherly=Cheryl 6 no9 Eloff They poisoning her! @Kopz I will support them if they stand up for the poor of all races Let’s get rid of that boys club in Cape Town @ Ntuthuko Buthelezi why would you want to do that? 
1:49:33,1:51:08, The wealth and power of whites is built on the enslavement and colonizations of other people..This is the end of that EFF is merely reacting to white racism..They speak the truth..They are not racist There's a boys club in Cape Town? Andrew 🍻 Dont go there Johnno i think it can bring joy & calmness to us black people if rich white people start donating their partly riches to black people coz remember all this divisions we see was brought by this guys. lol "@Louis..Remember that EFF had two white members..Those members left however so i believe white + black=Joy love unity success peace freedom. 
1:51:15,1:53:17, "Is there an administrator for this live chat? If so "Mugisha I think the rich of all races must subsidize the poor of all races "white will not donate to Blacks so true Louis Eloff 👍 for Ben Cole! @Kopz some areas EFF had one vote in the last election. @Maat Community but replacing it with greed and corruption bring poverty and high rate crime. White & Black middle class can do it together ✔ Louis Eloff such as?? 
1:53:27,1:54:40, "This is where the problem begins.. these guys are deployed into positions with business intrests! In all fairness Solly the white areas @Louis yeah..Don't get it twisted I'm not a fan or supporter of EFF .. The Africans carrying out coruptions are following the cultural values of Europeans @Kopz sorry I thought you were EFF Africans values is based on Ubuntu @Maat true = codesa ha ha ha EFF is not doing in white areas Solly because whites are scared of EFF 
1:55:49,1:58:29, @Louis I was stating facts about EFF ..I have perceived them as a party fighting for equality..I never saw them as racist.. Maybe they don't wanna subscribe to the idea of sharing "Kopz me too @Maat Community can i you ask a question? who gave orders to kill people in marikana? "@Solly yes ntiyiso awuhumi "Ubuntu=Maat Honestly white people are gud people & i think the reason which makes them fear to support Eff z because of malema dangerous views on race. are you guy's listening to the communion on your canvacing for Eff. 
1:58:49,2:02:40, lol "Mugisha "Louis Eloff don't be surprised if she has a ""foundation"" like others" Is she witness or accused? state capture is a serious crime lets not let this people get away with this including the Guptas lets build our country with honesty and with capable people. lets fight corruption its killing us "Very true my dear Louis Eloff This whole state capture happened because Africans are out of their minds....Not using African systems of Governance and culture as the foundation for development.. "yose Louis Eloff She is non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Gold Fields 
2:03:03,2:05:13, "Kopz Koape she's not feeling well today "@Mugisha they were waiting for Guptas Throw mama the stone Is Google allowed to witness here? "sorry dear Louis Jigaba Mugisha Bashir You will be harrased on your number.. remove it hehe It’s grigamba 
2:05:31,2:08:02, "Those who want dignity must pay for it in the proper currency @Mugisha thank you but I am not a social activist. I will follow you though in case I decide to get more involved ✔ fu cool dear Louis so this is why Gigaba Resigned... "Thanks bro interesting someone should lock up that Gigaba for a long time We need some more credible witnesses like Ramatlohdi 😋 
2:08:12,2:10:37, "Minister Gigaba was and is first captures in his MIND..disreguarding African cultural and spiritual values..Ubuntu What she is saying is technically incorrect @Zoleka..Yes actually he quit due to pressure Mutual benefit = integrity ? ITS SIMPLY CALLED THE FREE MARKET.... WAKE UP AND GET INVOLVED AND STOP BEING MOANING VICTIMS~! "So if they did benefit SEE A COMMIE< TELL THEM THEY ARE TERRIBLE PEOPLE WITH TERIRBL IDEAS THAT HURT THE POOR AND EVERYONE! There is no such thing as a free market...Just the opportunity for exploiters to extract wealth and the expense of others 
2:10:44,2:12:31, FREEDOM DOESNT MEAN FOR FREE! @G man keep quite "you are so indioctrinated spweing marxism and lies NEOLIBERALISM..the current phase of capitalism wants to force all enterprise into privatisation... I WILL NOT YOU FILTHY COMMIES! Gigabyte is a coward .. private sector FTW END COMMUNISM! 
2:12:45,2:15:59, "END THE MARXIST LIES THAT KEEP YOU BROKE  YOU ARE PUPPETS It is not capitalism or Communism...The right is Ubuntu. This one is a representative of white capital [stock owner even] and so the obvious people going under the bus are Gigs lama Gigs and Dudu Myeni Zuma.. get in or go suffer in silence "Ubuntu=Maat is structured into the fundamental laws of nature "Is this why we needed ""unity""?" A whole minister I bet Zuma and many other top ministers won't be prosecuted that's how horrible SA legal system 
2:16:05,2:19:10, G Man tell that to China So divisions & factional power battles killed the ANC 🤔🤔🤔🤔 jet airways are indians 🤔 Who were the two camps? "Louis Eloff I agree with you "@Kopz Koape I see them being called to apologize WMC ANC vs De-colonialisation ANC 
2:19:59,2:23:26, @Thembeka if that is the case then this state capture inquest is a waste of time they should be punished especially Zuma "Yerrr this people were laughing about our struggles The minister was busy taking videos aww Jacob Zuma officially the wost president evee. Disaster!!! There is a cultural unity of all Africans..based on Ubuntu/Maat/The Tree of Life/Paut Neteru etc All are unfortunately guilty of either 🚩A. primary state capture 🚩B. complicity in state capture 🚩C. turned a blind eye What baffles me is that Zuma was able to get away with it It is not just about the individual..Zuma I wonder how Gigaba is feeling now 
2:23:34,2:25:53, Zuma will be dealt with how can our country be governed by the likes of Zuma & Hlawudi or Nomvula ?? Or the other individuals like Gigaba "He was actually trying to look what happened to his balls in that vid And the ANC had aspirations of having Gigaba be a President of South Africa.... FFS.... just goes to show.... you have to keep looting going from one generation to the next... 3 hours of waiting ? "These people are like dominoes meetings at work i missed the session Nothing really happened @Buyiswa Mnyani the only important this is Cheryls name is Cherly 
2:25:53,2:29:53, African Governance systems is based on those in governement and leadership basing their personal developement and institutions on MAAT/UBUNTU. African are currently following the Europeans system and values...This is where we are all going wrong. What is wrong with the Europeans system Did that lady knew shes gonna be infrontbof cameras...i like the hairstyle Eish it seems there is alot of crazies on this live chat..Weirdos waitse i wander if Zuma will continue with his public appearances.???? SIBUSISO MABUZA Its a key hairstyle right.. THere is an African system of governance that all government in African and the Black world is ignoring Africans leaders are mostly out of their African MINDS 
2:30:18,2:33:14, i mean it is this europeans that are using our african leader to destroy africa@maat community SA Minister assisting a competing foreign airline = treason @Worlanyo Kponor how do you get to that conclusion Can't wait for Gigaba to come pull his wire here at the Commission. Jissas what a useless mthondo. "They have been educated in and with Eurpean cultural values and systems The African approach superior? @Sthakathi khumalo😁😃😂😂 "andrew In the African approach to Government..you dont rise to leadership without been trained in UBUNTU/MAAT and progress ur personal development based on this value system 
2:33:27,2:36:24, Strange the the state is not captured by any European countries You may not know @Andrew marshal Now I understand @Maat Community What was so important about this Mumbai route The original capture is kidnapping Africans to built the European and white world wealth updated version.... @Yose Human how is the world scared of south africa "Does anyone know if Siyabonga Mahlangu and Sifiso Mahlangu of ANN7 fame It made money and that's why the Gupta affiliated Jet Airways wanted it.... 
2:36:42,2:39:35, "This wealth in Europe started and is maintained through the capture of Black wealth Thank you Robert Russell that makes sense. THe capture of the African MIND is needed to maintain white wealth. "I wish all minister's and their deputy are watching this inquiry the can learn and stop been greedy and as president as well We will not bow to such slavery again @Maat Community They won't learn from this Why do you thin Europe and Amerian is promoting all sort of so called leadership programs in Africa? Anc is rotten to the core and it will forever be corrupt @Maat Community i dont understand your thinking 
2:39:36,2:41:27, The JESUS myth had captured the African mind with GREAT success @Maat Community how are guptas related to jet airlines other than being from india @Worlanyo Kponor That's if our leaders don't sell us out like they have been doing @Gareth Morgan They own 3/4 of it @Andrew Marshall for sure ? I wonder how many people the SAA flight carried to Botswana... I bet it's the same as the Gautrain Busses lots of busses but few people Slavery and colonialism is about capturing the MINDS of africans...using Europeanised African religions etc greed greed greed 
2:41:35,2:44:52, sure @Maat Community Does Jet airways still exist? Who owns/owned it? THe foundation of African integrity is UBUNTU/MAAT.. Christianity is the GREATEST victory of the white man over Africa @Maat Community do the guptas still own jet airlines the level of corruption is beyond my wildest imagination. . A full return to the Africa foundation is the real lesson of this capture... 😀 😀 😀 it is like watching a thriller movie @sipho cebo​the level of corruption is beyond my wildest imagination. . @Jean Pierre Ndayisaba - welcome to the world of Youtube chat 
2:45:03,2:47:07, This inquiry is going to take for ever The christ message is an Africa story of the ressurection of the divine principle in man/woman VAVI ANC VIVA Anc is going downhill..Down down Anc R500 billion lost to corrption under the ANC THe divine principle of UBUNTU/MAAT called Shango or Heru that African used to grow and develop leaders. Doha? or does she mean Abu Dhabi? because Etihad would fly to Abu dhabi as it has to touch base in its country before going onto another destination Qatar Airlines flies to Doha "That 500 billion could of been used to build schools 😀 😀 😀 it is all drivel maaan @Maat Community​The christ message is an Africa story of the ressurection of the divine principle in man/woman 
2:48:14,2:49:57, Oh here comes New Age bombshell "any gigupta supporters out there that think he is still and ethical person  We taught the christ to Europeans to then chage thse message to a white jesus and used it capture and colonise being an ANC member you are swimming in a pool of corruption....hang on you might be corrupted too. Conflicted interests between factional representatives. You must support my connection *Control Freaks* Manyi Manyi... pops up again ReAfricanizaion of our institutions based on the Africa world view is the solution 
2:50:06,2:52:18, Please return to politics Cheryl Carolus. SA needs people like you "The problem as a citizen of SA and a voter who do I vote for when Anc is corrupt i don't think Jimi will come here again 👍 agree @Atholl Hay​Please return to politics Cheryl Carolus.

Rams needs the votes of the ANCWL Indeed Atholl she is a real ANC material ANC needs a anti-corruption faction ✔ #NewANC Has the ANC ran out of credible leadership? I have an Indian colleague who gives me her lunch everyday... Am i captured? klaar...lol @Nelson Musoliwa Yip she is an ANC veteran in the league of Gordhan & Hogan We need new African MINDS free of the European world view and cultural values... @ERNEST MOKOKO You are captured my friend

2:57:02,2:59:41, Almost all our political leaders are in business with the government order @Ernest spot on. Captured State in progress "i just listen and all i hear is Nkanyezi's name The first principle of leadership is an understanding and committment to the principle of truth/ubuntu/maat. @Nelson Musoliwa Unfortunately too few @Maat Community sis Patricia Delile is about This is a proble in America and Europe...the leaders there is also capture to do the wishes of the 1%. Is JetAirways center to the terms of ref?
