1:56:49,1:57:20, 😥😥I really wanna cry... Zondo almost cried I bet @Clinton Swart I don't think it's business as usual this time. Too much information / evidence now in public. "South Africa is rich  are we swear that corruption is so crazy... that every citizen in our country can receive 1 million from government... did you know me too Snitching is so fashionable right now A song is a song irrespective of the singer i hope so but history bhas a way of repeating itself... 
1:57:37,1:58:16, @Selecta For which I am very happy BLOEM YOU ARE A CHAMPION @selecta 🤣🤣🤣🤣 So Bossasa reciecved R17m p/m for 3 years for only awarding inmates a certificate of training. That is a very exspensive certificate. you're sick🤣🤣🤣🤣 "Where are the guys so proud to vote for the ANC now? The ANC spits in our faces for free groceries and talks about WMC. ""The ANC is incorruptible""..." any bombshells yet ? Our tax money 😠 SOUTH AFRICA MUST TAKE TO THE STREETS. IF ANY DELAYS TO REMOVE THESE CORRUOTIRS. 
1:58:32,1:59:29, "FREEZE EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO BOSASA "If even if you love the ANC more than yourself any names any bombshells the anc has not provide a president that can serve full terms without corruption shutdown bosasa now! all of our tax money ..... its all gone into Watsons pocket. "@Gareth Morgan the state gave hundreds of millions to Bosasa for catering at prisons @Dylan Burden thanks Shut up Pretorias 
1:59:45,2:00:12, @Frik Brits and into a few MPs too at this rate we might need a museum of CORRUPTION with Zuma statue at the door "we need a committee like this one in Swaziland @ jeevan singh. IT IS HIGH TIME THAT WE ALL STOP BEING SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVISTS AND RULE OUT THE ANC FROM THE BALLOT PAPERS AS SOUTH AFRICANS UNITED WE STAND AND DIVIDED WE FALL. "WHERE'S IS #SACP where's is this country going Our money chowed like this. What happened to AMANDLA. We must take back the country and give it to the army now. @Dylan Burden ..... I know that personally as a fact All implicated ANC members in all the commission should not not be included in National and Provincial list 
2:00:12,2:01:16, @Selecta better a prison than a museum this is a true patriot..you guys should value such people in your country regardless that he left ANC and is with COPE..he is truly a nationalist! This guy and Agrizzi should be friends... they know how to spill all the beans... "THIS THING OF PLAYING THE RACE CARD MUST FALL @Frik. white companies and ANC Government are wasting our money. Mfundo 👍🙏 @Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona that's true "Yes waiting for BLOEM is Racist... 
2:01:20,2:02:00, @Sphelele Mavundla people are wasting our money. @Sphelele Mavundla and Guptas too Not white companies. Corrupt companies Now i know why other combrades left ANC and start their own small parties.

Madness. Queen Elizabeth please knight her DAME Thuli Madonsela.. @Clinton Swart Check the Mokgoro Enquiry 
2:03:46,2:04:31, now this is beyond the commitioner @Zibeke Ncwane Nkandla was basically just one corrupt contract. So many more to deal with... this goes back to 1994? There was a Gupta also (Miss moodley) "it has never been fitting to say ""GIVE THAT MAN A BELL""" Mr Bloem is top class but Agrizzi remains legendary and undefeated "@ rodney philipz Peterson uncovered this in 2008. The media reported on it and the ANC did nothing. They just transferred Peterson because they wanted to continue to loot the country at will. "Khalid 
2:04:32,2:05:14, We need to thank Thuli Madonsela there is a real race issue in our country and we need to deal with it some how running from it won't help us Nkondla is nothing compared to Bosasa corruption it just that Zuma was alone when stealing "@Zibeke Ncwane correct @Chloe Adams - Around 1999 from what was said the other day Dennis Bloem just finish ANC it's hard for me to believe any political party with my vote ❎..... I'm going to gladly abstain... no vote from me this year. this is corruption for centuries I can't take it. 😐 ya but this guy just said 1994 But Zuma warned them!! 
2:05:16,2:06:07, I’m back and the sound is better 😆😆 Judge Zondo looks hurt!!! 😟 "@Mfundo Veerasamy There will always be racial deferences this thing of us all being one ""rainbow Nation"" just a huge cover-up People died for the chance to vote.

2:07:31,2:08:05, `but please vote @MIKE LOCK HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Eish yaaah neeh i can not wait for this to lead back to Marikana mining scandal there is no country without racism. but s.a is the first country where racism is reversed IRONIC how the people who enjoy the prison tenders should be in PRISON "no I'm not voting.... that ""people died for a right to vote"" line has been played before....if thats the case ANC freed me should I vote for them even at the glare of rampant corruption 🤔" @sipho cebo doesn't matter - they could lose provinces and seats in parliament "Thats the problem in SA @Sihle Arthur U say Nkhadla was nothing  People will listen to this shocking revelations and still go out to ANC rallies and continue to be indoctrinated and lied to that the party is still relevant to govern

We see you 👀 @Mooks689 what space @Shelley Ashurst OMLORD @Bas Mdaka which conclusion boss ? Can Bantus build a city? people don't trust the EFF because it is pro blackness I think these issues were also happening in the apartheid era but the difference was that there was no transparency...
