Do your thing gm all Has the wise judge checked when ministers were sacked & new ones were appointed. That is significant as it shows a link between those who resisted & those who enabled

8:10,10:15, He did not do anything to stop state capture. Paul O' Sullivan rocked his boat This guy is cut from the same cloth as Bell Pottinger. gm SanFran.

13:03,14:27, @tumi and @ arnold your are welcome @Buyani. I know. I was commenting to someone who said he choses his responses well that is why those entities have a board "I believe the question has been answered sufficiently. There are factions at SOEs. On the other hand outside lawyers are also brought in with ""loaded"" agendas." Time for Adv Seleka to come in for the kill that's why he should be arrested also Morning All...usually watch after hours but today live me i don't under the matter mr seleka nail him 
14:34,16:05, Greetings all. Just joined now. Did I miss much? Mthokozisi Molefe Goodmorning to you I thought of you yesterday Why did the Zuma crowd hire a Rhodesian magistrate when we have such fine legal minds that are experienced and qualified in South African law? hey Elvis how are you today @Vhutali Mashila it is not and this testimony is important for verification of placement of individuals in meetings and the outcomes @Francoise. agreed Mthokozisi Molefe I am thanks and you i great you all i joined even thought i miss "hi all 
16:33,18:15, Very well Elvis now what did you think of me?

"Hello everybody Nonsense! There's no need for a coordinator! Yeah Elvis but I think this commission is a circus 
18:18,19:36, "imagine paying 20% more for a job for a ""Co-ordinator""" morning Xolani I suspect the commission has a bomb on his qualifications @Xolani J Masemula gm You were coordinating Dudu Myeni's neferious means yeah neh he explains everything as if he's in court mthokozisi Molefe let's have some patience I see some action is starting "Coordinating state capture and the stashing of state funds into the Jacob Zuma Foundation 
19:41,22:05, Yeah let wait and see Yes Adv. Seleka The Proper Co-ordinator. Wow.:elbowcough::elbowcough: Lets go Advocate Seleke Linnell is rather arrogant trying to justify his unnecessary fees "he was a hired ""gun"" to kill the careers of those who stood in the way of the looting" Linnelll didnt hire himself and just took what was given with open arms.... I bet you Zuma will want this interview I'm under loadsheding but there is no Eskom notice to this effect. 
22:18,24:18, Franzo "I hope Adv Seleke took this zuma looter to the cleaners..people Tappies you can't live without Zuma "Linnell was earning R167K per month Can anyone tell me why this guy has been allowed to testify like this? Why hasn’t he been hauled before the commission in person ?> @Paul Buchel excluding all of his extra claims :washhands::washhands::washhands::washhands:Ai ee that was R170k per month 10 years ago Ashne they're trying so much to run away 
24:19,27:22, Our Slow Poison is not playing any games today.😐 @Ashne Hesselberg He is afraid that police will lock him up if he appear Myeni likes to DUDU with Zuma @Ashne Hesselberg it is due to his underlying medical issues @SanFran Arnold thanks for this 🙏🏻 @Mthokozisi Molefe😅 @rohan barnard Zuma understood when she introduced herself as DuDu with Myeni @Ashne Hesselberg always a pleasure Yolo They're trying so hard to run away 😅😅 
27:23,29:16, @SanFran Arnold 🤣🤣 Sunday meeting lol lol lol this people are crazy @Andre Gerber 🤣🤣🤣 They're attending Sundays meetings these people don't even go to church 😂😂 @Mthokozisi Molefe he WILL have after this😂. A couple of extra heartbeats 😂 "Eskom meetings not at Eskom THIS LOOTING HAPPENED WHEN ZUMA WAS ELECTED..A PERSON WITH 99.9% NO EDUCATION..THANK YOU ANC😡 Protect me mr Chairman 😋 I'm suspecting another Watson saga after this Ashne😂😂 
29:58,31:01, Love this advocate !! He is brilliant Seleka 🤣🤣🤣 YES ADV. SELEKA is linnel in trouble? bunch of Clowns. Heres the rub 🙂 Did Mr Linnell knowingly deal with crookedness GM all WHY IS THE CHAIR INTERUPTING 
31:08,32:15, all the truths are coming out greetings to all @Mthokozisi Molefe yes he must put on his seatbelt for the ride "The meeting called for by the SAA chairperson to discuss Eskom business with the President the chair is protecting this crook mr zondo stop interrupting Testing Tsotsi this one. Dont protect him chair HUH???? 
32:33,33:55, coward The Chair is out of order. Adv. Seleke should be allowed to pursue his line of questioning i wondering if we still have a country or not. @Antoinette Meyer I hope he is in trouble. He is an arrogant person who demands authority... pointing fingers. He walks with Dudu since 2009 and that says a lot. Morning Peeps Chair let Advocate Seleka do his job please "The President should discuss issues with his ministers someone farted @Tommygun I don't think it was a concern to him what was happening He got his instructions did as told and pocketed the fee As a lawyer I don't think he asked to many questions = no knowledge 
34:10,35:50, why is the Chair focusing on the meeting in Zuma's house or the Durban meeting @Andre Geldenhuys Couldn't agree more @Jenny Whitewaves agree "Andre People I'm seeing a Watson Saga happening again soon they must protect this guy STRU Andre Geldenhuys He must fall with his Gang "This one was sweet yesterday @Anthony Fourie this is Mr. Nick Linnell "He's a prokerower 
36:15,37:13, Was there a formal appointment ? Yes or No this is not working. very frustrating. linell must come here. our borders are open @Anthony Fourie he was Dudu's lapdog. He was brought in to suspend the board of Eskom He is from Rhodesia and ran away to SA Elvis but I fear for this guy @fourie he was woerking for dudu muyeni and zuptas "This is not the seventies @Ntsikelelo Mgxigxwà Proves Dudu ;lied on statement proves JZ was in on setting up corrupt people in power at Escom toadvantafe of Guptas Can I also get a job there. No appointment but a nice salary... wow 
37:14,37:44, The cANCer like to use 'Outsiders' like the Guptas and Linell as pawns to do their work for them. wim hallo Antony Fourie he is an ex Rhodesian magistrate who was Dudu Myeni's coordinator/adviser and he fired people at Eskom according to Zuma's requests through Myeni. "is the chair answering for this guy now advantafe sorry @mthokozisi what happened to Watson is not what you think when and how did Linnell discuss his fees for his work and attendance at meetings? Formal appointment chair is formal appointment "if it looks 
37:51,38:39, He also set up the Jacob Zuma foundation which needs to be forensically audited urgently. Im sure he got his pay in writing from someone? @ALTA Hallo Meisie you are derailing the guy mr chair lol @togu madikane "Simple wow White guy getting preferential treatment #Zoom #MSTeams "i wish we will win against gangster in SA 
38:48,39:42, more Alta @molefe I guess he is still alive Chair I am not happy with you at the moment wim... sukkel met sein weer het wifi uitgeslaan Nothing is unclear here @wim louw @ALTA more mense andre hallo Khuzwayo yeah I heard man but I suspect this guy will also disappear He's playing it very political this guy

40:36,42:17, @Sabelo Nxumalo gm "Sunday meetings This guy was running with the top dogs without an appointment letter or something . . . EISH 🥵 GM @Sabelo Nxumalo @Paul Buchel Dagse. A strange choice of a consultant for Myeni support the board ? the board was not the one who hired him. Modus Operandi = Help his pocket. "Linnell has alo tols d us that all the SOEs have their own legal and hr teams but dont seem to do the job "@Theo van Zijl He was a ""consultant"" to Dudu. I don't think she would follow proper procedures 
42:18,43:40, "@wim louw @wim louw I was thinking the same You must still be appointed by the board to act on behalf of them in any consuling space This guy thinks he's clever. Hopefully Adv Seleka will catch him out "@Tommygun A fixer or a meddler? "strange @Fred Desrosiers well said I think Linnell has more than met his match in Adv Seleke @Will 
44:05,46:44, J ZEE is a real Gangsta......this madala is scared to death....he is so carefull when choosing his words.. incredible - did he ever question the legitimacy of his iinvolvement? "So far I dont get the feeling Linnell wants to hide anything All of them are choosing their words carefully. They all think they know (proper) politics "@GB correct legal minds are part of the loot this is scary no wonder these SOE are in shambles. He attended but it was cancelled Please pray for young farmer whose funeral is currently being held after he was brutally killed during a farm murder. I don't know what makes this guy so special to call in via Teams/ Zoom... 
47:02,49:10, "@Tommygun Hahaha... I was there but it was cancelled. I worked but I was never appointed.

50:32,51:46, I don't even think he's here in SA this one "@Paul Buchel  he is in Cape Town i was wondering if he has a sword above his head Can he not afford a car or alternative transport? Or is all of the money gone already :elbowcough::elbowcough: "@Mthokozisi "ohhh This man did alot of flying... 
51:56,53:22, Sounds like from his bathroom @Yolo More 😆 He might be in Hiding? "their brazenes in looting every cent that was meant for the people and the country is what gets me when I still see people hanging boards on street poles ""vote ANC""" "@Antonett Meyer i think it is too costly for travel abd accomadation Is Ace Magashule set to appear in this commission?? Does anyone know? Or he's self-isolating because he's been in contact with a Covid person? @Rip Torn lo Anne THUG 
53:30,56:22, Hi Antoinette @Anne M that is also possible😂 💰💰💰 "@Will​ "@Anne M. Could be - I see no pictures or any background items of interest - Sterile background normally means ""in hiding""." This guy need approval @Rory pro Magashule is well sarounded now his brazen crimes were very clear last week. they are just playing their cards right before he is arrested "He was receiving free flights with Dudu as she was still chairperson of that board. He arranged through his lawyers to give evidence this way due to age ace magashule will apear either by subpuna or a decree 
57:02,58:42, This guy was reporting to Dudu & Zuma. The minister was nowhere Falling apart He must must go to jail or go back Rhodesia Zoom commission is nonsense. He must come and lie in person Agree @Bumpy Johnson Dudu has no money anymore and she is a delinquent director and she has lawyers fees to pay for her appeal Not Rhodesia but Zimbabwe Ruins lol dudu has no money "@Xolile Titus 
58:47,59:27, Do you think Linnell will be her lawyer @SanFran Arnold ? @Xolile Titus I think it was Lynne Brown here the minister's job was to put a stamp Linell deposed an affidavit saying that former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni called him to a meeting with former President Jacob Zuma to discuss Eskom If Dudu asks me to attend a meeting and compile a document and I did nothing wrong - just accept a task for R 167 000 I shall do it.... I do not say Lennell is clear though. "This ghoon is ducking and diving...he "@Will thats a laugh @Yolo More To Chikurubi!! Baba Zondo is using this Rhodesia to set a trap for Dudu and Zuma 
59:53,1:01:02, cmon DCJ let the advocate do his job stop it DCJ .And former Eskom board chairperson Zola Tsotsi confirmed that Linell attended the meeting at Zuma’s residence in KwaZulu-Natal where Myeni was in charge and Linell was appointed as a consultant. "😅😅🤣🤣 DCJ 🖐🏽 hi ... Why did Dudu need a White Rhodesian magistrate to help her???????!!!!! "So the guy cannot work in his capacity as lawyer in SA "why is the chair interrupting the questioning so much 
1:01:23,1:02:02, "@Andre Geldenhuys Im with you He even says he knows the response.😊 Zondo is not nice today @Will I guess so. "DCJ dont think DCJ DJC Confused DCJ please keep up with Adv.

1:02:08,1:03:51, "@Luke Fisher .Myeni denies that Zuma was present at the meeting but both Tstotsi and Linnell put him at the meeting together with her son This guy think he's very clever. Playing this thing very clever "Zondo must adjourn and have a strong cup of coffee DCJ is acting like Miss Mbanjwa today... yolo lol ADJOURNED @Linda James rather glaring discrepancy "Shame I think Zondo is GATVOL for all the lying Chair is kind of slow today...

1:06:01,1:07:33, Mr Linnell's testimony is key. He was working for Dudu Myeni but repudiates her version of events and supports Mr Tsoti's version. Zondo was spotted in sexonworld enjoying curry there😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 "@Sbusiso Dlomo  😂😂 ..they did it properly Saxonworld sjebeen 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Sbusiso Dlomo agreed 🤣😂 "From a legal point of view

I never asked why because then I could say this rubbish under oath without lying There was no wrongdoing on any of the exec's part. They just needed Gupta stooges in True dat @Jenny Whitewaves @Jenny Whitewaves And get paid that R160k per month consultancy fee. 🤨 yes sanb... and the guptas fled gone with most of the money😠 "Zuma needed them out for the Gupta's Hello @Anne M. Apologies for not seeing you earlier. @Anne M. may have been on my mind 
2:15:09,2:17:15, @ALTA not most.....all.....what is being done today is to rebuild. They took it all leaving us on our knees "@SanFran Arnold Yup. Dudu was ""THE MAN"" !" what does this guy know🤔 @Naledi Barron Hello. Nice to see you back on the chat. sanb somethings cooking here. DCJ appear very unsettled today true sanb It's lawyer training you don't ask the defendant you are defending if they are telling the truth so that they can't say you didn't do your best for them breaking news gonna be a shocker 
2:17:15,2:18:29, "The first sign of dodgy dealings @Jenny Whitewaves exactly "honestly speaking this is a tough one cause Eskom was always a failing company anne agree "DCJ cannot handle the fact that he not only being a lawyer Nicholas is remorseless "it's hard to say there was no. need for an audit ...The pop-up suspensions just happened because the president and dudu were loading their money into varing containers to China. yessss chair yessss!!!!!@ 
2:18:40,2:20:21, "..btw @SanFran Arnold need to go further back than that there is something about the water dept in I think EC minister brown must come back here @Xolani J Masemula Eskom was not always a failing SOE. We had the cheapest electricity for years and then it was overrun by looters Yes @Yolo More . Pretending that he did nothing wrong. mr k still waiting saa for buyers @Jenny Whitewaves water affairs has everything to do with Nomvula Mokonyane and that has to be answered as well @SanFran Arnold Its the old case of SOEsand Municipalities not having the capability/work ethic of running things and calling in consultants to do their job. "@SanFran Arnold Precisely. Before the looters came along 
2:20:21,2:21:28, "No Will never Fly SAA again-old aircraft-will possibly fall outta the sky "@sanFran Satan gerhard.... yes "@Tommygun exactly. the capacity is not numbers @SanFran Arnold this guy first became an adviser to Dudu in some stuff about water before SAA @Xolani J Masemula wise word choice post 94... How do you talk about problems with suspended executives? 
2:21:49,2:22:58, when baba dudu came in can't wait "if you look at the damage to the Grid and the state of the stations "@Jenny Whitewaves yes he was her ""fixer"" in the KZN area water board. He has walked a long path with her" @SanFran Arnold Still shart I see neh @B.... 😉 *sharp We need to know what he had to fix for her then @Naledi Barron thanks hun Argument might be that no sane person specially with legal background would have suspended the board members Nic was pushing Atul Gupta's agenda 
2:23:15,2:24:52, Yup he was the fixer and dudu was the blesser @Tommygun that is the argument that DCJ is struggling with being the second highest judge in our land "@Jenny Linell's brief was to remove the executives @rohan barnard she was blessed by her blesser "honestly if you look at the amount of electricity that is ""stolen"" there is no way Eskom is generation a profit How important was it that Escom failed to push the nuclear option because of Russian bribes and the Guptas uranium holdings @Sal SA hello @SanFran Arnold jacob dudu with myeni zuma 
2:25:10,2:28:21, "Atul @rohan barnard 😅😅😅 "@Xolani J Masemula True Because they were persuaded by the legal advisor aka mr fixer I think Dudu was the fixer and Linnell was the legal rubber stamper. @Jenny ... chief Molefe as acting CE and Anoj Singh CFO. They facilitated take over of Optimum coal mine n payments to the Gupta's "@Tommy Gun @San Fran Hi n to all how much is sodi worth 
2:28:27,2:30:01, @Xolani J Masemula Yup! Sal hi hi sal sa "... Integrity and Knowledge are not the essential qualities in corprate emplyment schemes. Servitude is mostly the essential factor Too much waffling by Zondo ? trying his best to extract any info implicating Zuma. ots called Zuma hunting. @Rosa Hi sorry to ask. Is SAA flying? Alta Hi should look at all dudus and linells dealings 
2:30:23,2:32:35, julie.. not yet Another witness please. thanks ALTA It was the wrong view based on the evidence at the time julie 😊 Hindsight? anyone? he was in collaboration with zuma dudu tsotsi..everything that follows is illegal zondo ur wrong today 
2:32:49,2:34:28, "@Rosa So Sodi owns at least 20 properties Why were the chief proponents of RET using a White man as their fixer????? Sal than you @cassim suleman So true and unfortunate @ Sal SA : Glad to see him losing it ALL!!!!!! @Rosa my pleasure @Linda James Why do all these Socialists own and covet so much... sodi s company did 1b in govt tenders.however he had to share this loot with accomplices.not sure how much mpambani received "@Linda James

This is fresh food for ANC comrades @MONDI...YESSSS Release this liar @cassim suleman Bingo! @Sal: Indeed-start with his bank account then sell off all his properties and cars. Should be able to make a healthy sum back with interest My theory is that RET is a FARCE.....It is used to escape culpability for their covetousness @Tommygun Now the electricity makes the pot becoming hot!!! he must give all that money back nd then the poor must get their houses water nd electric 
2:36:42,2:38:39, @Gerard yes as the legal process unfolds getting difficult to come up with the lies This Advocate has really grown into his role - he's doing wonderfully!! Agree @Naledi Barron Power to you advocate. You now have him by the short and curlies! I agree with you 100% Naledi yes hes doing fantastic "@Mondli Nohashe I suspect there will be more enablers of the corruption at Mega City development development Have you been in Saxonworld mr Magistrate? 
2:38:42,2:40:05, @thapelo..linnell knows his nose should have not been there..he is defending himself This man is giving evidence from an empty room with the echo @Yolo More exactly he must tell them if he ate the curry "Keep up the pressure advocate @Naledi hope u well. Adv is making an excellent case he definitely ate "Thats it Adv. Seleka He is done @Yolo More. He smells curry 
2:40:18,2:40:51, "@Sal SA GTSY friend! Yes This guy always has a different view White just trying to chew a bone with no meat lol "So was it Linnells idea to suspend or was it someone elses? If it was his it was a crap idea He cooked his own goose This moegoe is hiding somewhere so that it will be difficult to arrest him..that explained the empty room. """those people needed to be"" then corrects himseelf" He must not breath Advocate Seleka. Linnell knows that he was brought in as a farce. The whole thing was done way before by the Gupta's 
2:41:14,2:43:10, Go for the jugular now adv Seleka Linell must have made a lot of money from the Gupta's - was aink in the corruption chain at SAA n Eskom a link @Xolani J Masemula Yes Xolani and its bleeding really bad lol "Clearly his opinion Dudu brought in a non Gupta fixer so as to cover her trails. He is complicit in the wrongdoings but he is not an exact wrongdoer No waste of time. This one is supposed to sleep behind bars today He is a shoe shine boy DCJ again🙄 
2:43:10,2:45:47, "...Eskom is a cash cow for investors abroad Are there any other precidents of suspending employees on full pay with no charges or allegations so that investigations can go forward? Tappies Smit 100% This country will continue to regress under the corrupt leadership of the comrades. "Nowonder why this investigation was happening silently and private Eskom owes 500mil in debt far from being a cash cow. It has been depleted of cash by Zuma and the Gupta's. What we need now is international investment for the betterment of local South Africans @Tappies Smit - I noted that earlier - correct @SanFran I think he knew exactly the damage he'll cause. Totally complicit @tappies maybe in his bunker🤣 
2:46:06,2:47:21, This moegoe is trying to justify his actions to clear his name from wrong doing...he is a looter like zuma and his cronies. "@Makhosi it's ridiculous "He has an escape hatch in the ceiling "@Sal SA he should have asked the questions instead of just doing Services were terminated- job done!!!! Mohamed Mia 😄😄 This witness should stay in hiding @Rip Torn🤣🤣🤣🤣 "It's simple. Guptas & Dudu stole Eskom. Zuma had to 'protect' his family from investigation 
2:47:21,2:48:13, Arnold skom owes 500billuon He whitwashed it How can they do that if he did not have a contract to do any work at all? Adv Seleka = LEGEND!!!

Yesterday Linnell spoke about his long relationship with Myeni as a consultant. @Sal SA only Dudu can know This guy disagrees with everything. No wonder he were not allowed to be a lawyer in zimbabwe @SanFran Arnold Hello Darling. Is that really your middle name? No offence meant Was this guy Myeni's Bag man? He seem to have followed her on her devious project in the SOE's? @CYRIL NDABA Don't forget ConCourt Judge Kriegler! @ CYRIL NDABA please dont forget Adv Notshe. I simply love watching his absolute competence too at leading evidence. 
2:50:36,2:51:37, Anyone know what happened to the last hour of ZC streaming yesterday? Censorship?? @Cyril. no Adv Notshe and Pretoruis. Their cases infront of a judge. Vincent Smith and asbestos "...Cobalt is mined across Africa at a values specific to the markets @Pastor JJ We warmly welcome 😁👏🏽👏🏽 @Pastor J.J yes San for saint and Fran for Francis.

2:52:15,2:52:55, @SanFran Arnold Special. So now I dont have to think about that famous Nanny anymore. hahahahaha Linnell was a front for the actual goings on behind the scene Lynne Brown should be next in the hot seat @R.m. B. Apparently JHB weather was so bad it interfered with Linnells internet connection so it had to be adjourned. @Pastor JJ 🙏🏾💙😁 "@R.m. B. No @Pastor J.J 😂😂😂😂 @Rene Ngwenya. Awu! Notshe my home boy @Rip Torn Brown should be arrested 
2:52:56,2:54:30, he looks evil Where is the A Team today? "They fired him so they could blame him for the ""poor"" advise of firing the execs" 👍 @SanFran Arnold @Pastor J.J Just missing @ValenciaJ I think this former Rhodesian advocate is angry at that excommunication especially because he was so actively involved at all levels as the fixer. "give us names Linell @Sal SA exactly. Brown was told to force his ousting so it could not come back to her and her president These parasites hide behind Apartheid racism while they suck the life out of the country hurting the poor the most. 
2:54:34,2:55:41, @Aubrey De Bliquy are you in way related to the champion for marijuana freedom? @Naledi Barron I suspect she might just be that Goat that pays us the occassional rare visit Nick is the only witness so far with a credible testimony....

2:55:54,2:56:43, @R.m that's your minority view I'm sure @Thobani Mkananda Dagga prohibition is the last remaining Apartheid law. WHO cannot find their original document justifying prohibition because it exposes the hand of the Apartheid regime. @Rene Ngwenya Probably also the fat pay check he was getting. khuluma baba ukuze ungangeni ejele @R.m.

He was being paid his consultancy fee and did what they asked. What he did not do was loot the state.

Had some professional matters to prioritise @Pastor J.J Regarding @ValenciaJ. You might well be correct. Perhaps there will be a resurrection?? 
2:58:05,2:58:57, @LYD online tv I have no idea where that bathroom islocated @Aubrey De Bliquy The residues of the apartheid regime are still part of parliamentary processes if we accept your view hey? Crook from Rhodesia True what you are stating @ Arnold @sanFran Arnold: I certainly hope he has personal protection.... @Pastor J.J kwaaaaa! "You should have one look at the rogues gallery of Amicus Causae behind the governments defence of Dagga prohibition. Big Pharma Linell was agent n carried out Dudu's mandate at SAA n then Eskom @Naledi Barron say it aint so - Weezer 
2:58:58,3:00:23, I have the greatest admiration and respect for the calibre of the legal team and of course for DCJ Raymond Zondo. They are like a light for our country. @R.m.

Zondo is ready for lunch & next witness ...Phone data records are the bindings from persons who wish to be clandestine. Lunch manje Seleka:yougotthis: He is done lol lol lol 
3:03:58,3:04:44, @R m B. linell don't need security. All what that commission wants from him is to confirm the meetings.

3:07:22,3:09:17, A meaningless role I am glad that suspicions tthe nation had that some loadshedding was unnecessary was true... outages were planned so that the looters could benefit from more diesel consumption at some plants. ...He's a Scribe........ @Tommygun. is the implicated Zuma coming back ? Waste of our money advices from NICOLA @Mondli Nohashe I believe hes been politely asked to come back 🙂 Things were wrong in areas as you wanted to make space for a GUPTA Board at Eskom - you and Dudu... "In my dreams The business doctrine is amoral unaccountable profit that gives us Imasi at Pick'n Pay local stores feeding the poorest squatter camps at twice the price I get it from my local Giant Hyper. 
3:09:22,3:10:30, Zondo is underlying the fact Linnell 's services was a waste of money and time He just set up the suspensions and rubber stamped it. The way the ruling party shredded our country to bits with no valo nogal and only thinking about their greedy selves😥😫😥😌!! Once the board had their suspensions and media release they could carry on Without Linnell @SanFran Arnold; yes @Rip Torn Well observed. Let's bring on the REAL thieving b*****ds! mr zondo just tell him he was used as a doormat Where are my usual suspects to give me the download🙆🏾‍♀️😥?? 
3:10:31,3:11:34, "I think Zondo wants to see what kink he has to ""Businessman""" Unregulated Free Market Capitalism is undoubtedly an evil predator that created inequality by design. "The scourge of capitalist greed! So sad our ""socialist"" orientated state could not care for the poor." @Tommygun. I hope Zuma will come back because he is at the centre of everything This Linnell is thick skinned as a Rhino - He costed the country millions in packages paid to the suspended guys..... The public is starting to demand retribution - now! @Naledi Barron where have been moghel and hope you keeping warm in the miserable weather😌😊!
