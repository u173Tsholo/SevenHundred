Have we got a new bunch of non attendees? Summonses should be automatic 
1:00,17:33, Finally she has arrive "Yesterday It ticks me off when people know what heycdfe Morning all. Who is giving evidence this morning? Morning inmates "Shame Great sound tech guys thanks 😊 "Morning Ace Magashule is running out 
19:47,23:36, Zimbabweanlivesmatter Who is watching the cigarette ban hearing ?? This are getting heated 😂😂😂 Seems I am still a criminal oh je Mr Commissioner @kevin on what channel is it ? You tube....live enca kevin is it live somewhere? Thanks Kevin i see you responded to Mingosh. "Application for postponement again 
24:04,33:23, who is the client? This exposes the weakness of the commission legal team or sabotage amongst them. His client should take the stand and give his version. He can apply to cross examine in future if necessary chair just issue summons already Too many postponements on day of hearing. DCJ must resolve this abuse no more extension of the time frame given to the commission. DCJ muat nip this postponement stories now "this counsel is almost running to tea break and the chair is going along Decline please DCJ "Really there is too much posponements 
34:27,38:04, the black ones though 🤣 hahaha black ones though dis pipo are boring now everyday is another story every counsal got there on problem legal team of the commission seems to be dropping the ball to often recently people are beginning to sabotage the commission. Mr. Zondo must put his foot down. @Suicidal careful on your racial undertones Boss and the owner thinks it's OK Legal procedure is each party gives evidence then cross examine. So let's get it on. How many people here in the chat can smear their entire face with poopoo and still look the same 💩🙈🙊 
38:16,40:24, @Barbara Sattler I agree but it’s always going to be a case of the more guilty u are the harder u will push back the innocent sit & get on with it😃 what is predjudice if you are coming to tell the truth? Public forum why not. it's our money and it's in public interest. What a slimy bunch. @Barbara nobody's sabotaged here..this is a waste of tax payers money..the judge is incompetent as well. he talks about his strange feelings in Makhubeles case..what on earth This council is out of order these are PUBLIC. FUNDS. that have been stolen No one is more important than the other... people have been coming to give testimony. now he wants to prescribe to the commission how it must do its work "@Mike Clark that is my motto in life 
40:28,45:34, it's all because the commission is a toothless bulldog JZ also appeared in public. People are obsessed with cross examination than giving testimony I am not saying all lawyers are slimy. Testimony first and then cross examination This guy is wasting time. He must read the commission's rules and follow it. DCJ must rule "looks like this is going nowhere again today @Sydney yes! Throw terms of reference on his face DCJ Please 
45:35,49:49, Sidney P - That's because the runner wants to win the race before the gun in s fired.:elbowcough: Poor presentation from an SC bb "Counter argument from Adv. Pretorius is powerful @Barbara Sattler Anyone applying for cross examination before testifying usually are dodgy characters This reluctant witness has clearly been schooled in ANC Stalingrad stalling methods at Lootfreely House by Ace himself Hear Hear I hear you ADV P “Entirely unhelpful” 🤣... Mara English is beautiful! 
49:59,52:52, No cross examination will help Tugwana. Lead investigator is on point Mr. Zulu is not present. Mr. P is an optimist. DCJ its 11am - time is money masingene DCJ @Sal SA jeeeessssseeeeeessss lets go already how i wish Adv Pretorius was the one to cross examine Makhubela ( miss know it all) So Mr. Zulu must give evidence because Mr. Dukwana feature no where and as a result anything regarding testimony is not part of evidence leader question. Or President Hoffman! Sal SA irritating to the core jeeeerrrr 
53:51,56:30, "If Mr. Zulu does not appear today he's fed up with lame excuses Rule 11.3 Every application musy follow a particular format yes Abel 👍 @Barbara Even if it means in the evening like Makhubele yesterday. This postponements are sickening Indeed Adv. Pretorius is on fire😅😂🙈🤷 Actually these thieves have nothing to worry about they canjust sit & say yes I enriched myself off the poor & leave in thier Merc AMG. Nothing will happen to them nobody goes to jail if u are ANC Halala Zulu..... Mr Pretoruis is here @Thabo Yes He is doing what DCJ couldve done 
58:26,1:02:26, Ducking and diving is over... I dont blame them though theyve learned from the best JZ "mmmmm eeeer eeeer "mmmmm eeeer eeeer Counsel for Mr Zulu gets on my nerves "Thank you @abel lol I think I am off to the doctor. Need some hypertension medication. @Barbara Im sure if i should laugh or sympathise with you...😂😂🤔🤔 This is too much 
1:02:27,1:04:54, @Barbara Sattler better make it a double- this witness must be seriously guilty just how much did he steal from out our trough! There that cough 🤔 Adv Pretorius is so irritated with this guy @Sydney I think it is my own fault. I take things very seriously. DCJ he should know he can object when the questions are put to his client. Please rule. Yes Rule Now Chair This advocate looks more desparate than his crooked client! @Barabara We are on the same bout... I get too involved too... 😂😂😂 This guy is like Baldrick from Black Adder 
1:05:02,1:07:00, He must be summoned if he does not cooperate . Stop wasting time dammit From now on everyone will receive a summons. Mr. Zondo mentioned this on Monday. Zondo is useless the anxiety 😴 Sies. These crooks have got nerves to continue on delaying the commission's time... Baldrik 🤣🤣🤣 These legal guys are the problem- they must guide their clients properly 
1:07:45,1:09:55, Mr. Zulu looks like Mr. Over Perfect. "let's move on guys avoiding to testify today is what Mr Zulu would wants. Compulsion Please Chair is getting a migraine the only changes I see frm the chair is his hands getting whiter n whiter by d day kkkkkkk Yeah dismiss time for tea every time these witness waste half day urging for nothing @Samuel go ahead 
1:10:05,1:12:20, "DCJ why it's your ""inclination"". You leaving the door open to argue." true Corruption! DCJ must just dismiss this argument Mr Pretorius is getting irritated nw Mr. Zondo give this lawyer five minutes! This commission of enquiry is a joke Why your client is scared to answer any questions? End the anc for the sake of the country! 
1:12:21,1:13:53, @dada how much to the €? Who is this clown wasting the commission's time guilty are afraid can Mr Zulu testify already He's going back to the start of his argument "ijoo re tsamaya mo tseleng ya ga Mme Makhubela This is all time wasting nonsense no postponement this one he's drunk 
1:13:55,1:15:38, purpose none at all they won't get a postponement unfortunately 😂😂😂😂 stop Wasting ourtime stupid 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 How many arrests made? This is how we know for sure how corrupted the system is time is money If Zuma could appear so can Mr Zulu. Reputation is affected when you commit a crime. This is in public interest even I as a non law person can see no weight in this argument. dismiss and lets question this man This lawyer has now earned his $$$$$$. He is happy now 
1:15:40,1:16:52, All this lawyers are wasting so much time so that they can continue benefiting more money from their clients application disnissed "Lawyers are snakes They are concerned about their reputations now but when they steal they don't think about that. dismissed thank you DCJ This zulu guy is going to run :):):):) Yeah dismissed - crazy it took so long to rule. So this DCJ let you speak and then 1 minute later dismiss your application. 
1:16:56,1:19:14, At last a decisive Justice Zondo took a decisive view "People seem to be entitled to a right to appear or not appear Corruption must fall Anc must fall "Thanks DCJ for not allowing postponement Where are the arrests???? coming Corrupted legal system! Anc = African national corruption 
1:19:56,1:23:46, Did it have to take this long for DCJ to dismiss this application? "I am happy DCJ dismisses Zulu application "They brag about their possessions in the public space  I wonder how much they paid the judge "Ace Magashule doesn’t like to write things down 😂🤪🤪🤪🤪 Dukwana said that Zondo is not tainted "Lawyers are snakes "Esther this lawyer does not seem to know the rules of the commission Who needs a lawyer? The criminals. 
1:23:54,1:32:33, He wasted our time and money Zuma delaying tactics must come to an end. ACCOUNTABILITY IS NAME OF THE GAME. I want to see arrests Matamela is responsible for all...this game is nonsese switch off the mic 🙂 Next elections yourll better not vote anc or eff. Don't ruin our country. Anc needs to end o get lost for words when I read some comments here...stick to what you know best rather than make a fool of yourself @Tumelo Themba You have said the most ironic thing I've heard all day true 
1:34:03,1:39:03, @Esther best to zip up when one has no clue Just arrived is it a tea or lunch break? tea break they gonna be back any second now "@dada ngova @vonani..i have lost you Zulu has a nice smile- wonder if it will last. "you talk too much What are they speaking about?

1:46:57,1:49:59, tsotsi has arrived By the time they find the pages it will be lunchtime. When are they going to arrest Ace ? The ANC will protect him After his secretariat at Anc right now he is too powerful Yes they will protect him like they did Zuma with nkandla sad if he is protected best we can hope for is that he is removed from any office Zulu must speak up😂 don’t be so scared He looks familiar 
1:50:15,1:55:40, Yes he does look familiar I’ve seen Mr Zulu before "Ace as SG will be there first to issue a statement that Zondo Commission is not a Court of law rather only a Commission. Just watch that space Page 35 They must put R35 next numbers so they sound like money. He will find them quickly 😂😂 When is Mr Ace going to testify? What is Mr Zulu's background??? background how difficult can it be between 34 and 36 Zulu was the best Director General in FS Department of Human Settlements 
1:55:44,1:59:33, Starred in a film with Michael Caine @Thabo Best in what way??? Sorry error Zulu was not the best Director General of Human Settlements noted he best in way of unlocking funds for corruption @Fusi 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂😅🤷 Fusi!! Oh no😂😅🤷 Correct 
2:00:04,2:06:33, How many Dept`s in a Dept ?? Look at the Chair Balance my body language ? Who is this guy? Mr. Zulu here is the unlock funds... No one told Mr Zulu say as little as possible and don't try to be clever "@FieliesSA he is Mr. Thabani Zulu  
2:07:49,2:13:29, "It may be this "Ja well That sounds to me like money ready for the looters : A budget allocated but not assigned a project...? "In other news Did Zondo just sanitise the file? "Before they were Kings (Colonisation) @Solly he is a king of the ANC amabhaca Jip....he does not trust any file....lol mr zulu ohhhh lol aaai 
2:14:47,2:26:44, Looking at the Middle East and these thieves we are still savages 🤓 🕵 "might have ANC LOOTERS "Thats the way my son looks when he knows that you know he is guilty But where is the clever Judge. ..... did she finish last night. .... 🤣🤣🤣 ANC is using majority vote to escape questions and accountability and run away with the money 💰 
2:27:51,2:30:26, He will try the collective decision making trick soon. Collective accountability Sad but true I agree Dont know whether u send an email you are not sure?/???/😴😻😻😻 Persons found guilty will appeal indefinitely "no I will only take ANC serious when I see a high ranking politician go to jail "😂😂🤪🤪@ Cerebis but no ways to run away in this one 
2:34:06,2:38:38, "I don't want to mention their names @makhosi nobhatyi That is true! The people are still living under asbestos! "Ace Magashule is throwing this guy under the bus 10% kickbacks and brown envelopes Is Zulu the fall guy in this case? apparently he is the architect... ace thinks he's untouchable. can't stand the guy That’s what they say I tend to like mr Dukwana since he stand up to challenge Ace Magashule position but that was not sinking right into some comrade and he went further doing accusations but no one listens 
2:38:40,2:41:43, # malfeasANCe . I like that we don't want the commission to be close to nailing thieves all we want is for the corrupt to go to jail they must go to jail very fast I think it is getting time for Mr Zulu to have a fake heart attack??? But Samuel Skosana The Commision is a toothless dog cause in the end they can only pass recommendations to the Government which for obvious reasons won't be carried out. "@Pienaar van Wyk that is not going to happen as far as I know "True Exactky @Pienaar van Wyk 
2:42:10,2:48:33, Cyril is a globalist If we have an independent judiciary we will see these folks behind bars What a lame duck President they gave us "With the current outrange from the ground "@samuel Eddie no one in the Anc "Hundreds correct @ p maybe frm other organisations
