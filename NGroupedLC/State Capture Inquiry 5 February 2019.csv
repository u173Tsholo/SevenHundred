1:11:12,1:11:49, seems to be going RED every time a question is asked amnesia is not even the problem it's stupidy Maybe his protection request was declined Guys lets not worry at all. The Chair has said that NPA must start to investigate and prosecute who is implicated. You meet somebody to hand over LARGE amounts of money and you never asked or exchanged names...bullshit!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣hhayi shame siyatitsandza tindzaba uyeva 🙈🙈🙈 body language experts say when you look down you are actually looking into your emotions it's what is called a hostile witness liar liar liar mabe ashame of the lies 
1:11:49,1:12:54, Kashmir Solidarity Day crook Strange I would ask if Mr Lawrence if he counted the cash before handing it over to BOSASA . Very odd not to reconcile money to be handed over. dont blame for not wanting to SNITCH some big boys are going to prison for taking our country for a banana state wow cycling shorts... that's very helpful pinocchio Yes @Nono Mxotwa🤣🤣🤣 It is a banana republic Am I missing something here? You deliver cash and you dont know how much and for how long? Talk about protecting yourself! Agh 
1:13:02,1:14:18, cant stop staring at the pretty advocate his eyes can tell you he is a liar who came here to create smoke screen.... "Bob: Knock Knock. Joe: Who's there. Bob: Amnesia. Joe: Amnesia who. Bob: Wait Twitter. Team News24 confirmed Bosasa employee on the video is Jacques van Zyl. That guy receiving the cash is Jacques van Zyl CFO this guy is telling selevtive truths to cover himself Guys... the sad thing is .. nobody is going to jail after this commission of enquiry. It’s all coordinated for election purposes. To make it look like something is People gotta wake up too this. The love of money is the root of all evil... Lawrence operated on instructions he is not a hostile witness 
1:14:28,1:16:58, they all together played the banking system well... Bosasa finance employee Jacques van Zyl @Dj Bozemanl This time they will all go to jail. The Chair has said that. He has instructed National prosecuting to start with their investigation. why did the bank not report their transactions as suspicious as they did with the Guptartars Have to have faith in our judicial system Ramaphosa has been warned @Thando Nkutha 😂😂😂😂 Desmond... I hope I’m proved wrong.but one must understand that the players at the top are controlling things. Same old same old. Are black people not afraid of jail? 
1:17:04,1:18:06, the banks only reported the GUPTAs when the media had already exposed them.. bosasa was never really exposed @Thando Nkutha. No why anybody seen the Watsons lately Are we on the race thing again? I thought we left this behind us in 1994 lol white people see prison as how it used to be... not the hotel it is today stop playing the racist card. Crime is Crime how do you forget the person you were dealing with 20 times? henry it will never die "Black people are not afraid of jail

On that one you right. but this time around things will change. just joining plse update whos the new state witness & are they on tea break???? @mahlanga true...interesting though skelm Yes I don't think they are afraid of jail which is foolish. perhaps because jail is a free meal ticket i usually block the chat so as not to get affected by the racism nna I'm afraid of jail Twitter ..
