time,32:18,message my other favorite advocate.💃 Another day of looting exposure this looks like a british descent south african citizen So what if this man is of British descent?? not today please it's too early guyz i dont know what @Val Speirs is worried about my statement.. This learned gentleman is going to explain that the purchase of the Chinese locomotives were not compatible with our train tracks/rails. 
33:20,42:58, "This man is well spoken  This is going to be interesting Eastern Cape Premier elect in new scandal.A new Bentley costing R4m and house renovations in question You seem surprised.......????? @Magda Seguin anyone can be a learned and articulate as long he/she given an opportunity.. trolls should be ignored completely! They eventually disappear into thin air.. "Not really @Robert Russell i doubt @Rubin Naidoo the whole of them looted SA 
44:08,54:13, looters must be brought to book ... watching from europe @Rubin Naidoo From what I hear None. All departments were infected with this looting streak. I would be suprised if I was told otherwise. I may be mistaken but didn't the Guptas have majority shares in China South Rail? The billions paid to CSR was never paid back as they never provided anything Nope no share holding.... only kick backs via Issa and a Hong Kong shelf company @Magda Seguin @Rubin Naidoo No - all levels of government have been corrupted by the ANC "@Rubin Naidoo I know the feeling I do wish that the railway system could be resurrected so that these heavy duty transporting Trucks do not have to be on the roads which would also reduce maintenance costs.Army must safeguard trains. Mohammed Mohammedy... connection :O 
54:14,58:08, Thanks @Robert Russell my head is spinning with all the details..its becoming hard to keep up truth is if most of us had the means to start over anywhere we would "@Val Speirs exact;ly  Oh Yes@Robert Russell I remember the shelf company now You might have been confused with Denel and VR Laser @Granny Mokwena there was a time I cried every day listening to this commission..its soul destroying especially knowing the majority of SA people are struggling and poor the english in general have bad manners..the guy doesnt even address the dcj as chair as per norm.. "Yes I was confused @Robert Russell more show 
59:48,1:05:17, As long as he makes eye contact with Judge Zondo it's fine one does not have to keep referring to the Chair. I think his manners are impeccable. I agree with you Magda..... about the poor people suffering even more than they deserve too... imagine what a R140 MILLION could do instead of the ANC spending this on a party for CR next week @Val Speirs no man.. If they made a gesture to have a small ceremony it would have showed compassion and integrity Ramaphosa should just be sworn in.. no party celebrations in this terrible economic climate. R140m just for one day.. @Val l agree with u this ppl must save money for education homelessness health I think he should be sworn AT for allowing this waste of money Magda this money is too much Anc cant think properly 
1:05:52,1:09:46, I see on Twitter that people are not happy about the inauguration flamboyancy and spending @Bridgette Kekana ....Zuma's last party cost R240 MILLION.... so the ANC now thinks they are doing well.... @Magda n me 2 l m not happy doing nothing Imagine if the money had been spent on service delivery and uplifting the poor what a difference it could have made to these communities... but that is not what happened. Out if the 32 thousand invited only 10 thousand 'ordinary'South Africans are allowed as 'walk ins'...those who have no cars will not stand a chance. "@Bridgette Kekana Me too The Rich have heaven on earth the poor remain the same. going to Loftus n get one thigh or drumstick n 3 slices of bread 
1:10:17,1:13:43, CR has the back bone of a jelly fish..... expect to see the same crooks in the NEC selection... @Magda Seguin The entry for ordinary SAs are between 3am and 7 am...its laughable having to wait for hours until the others arrive Bathabile Gigaba n Nomvula going to parly l cant believe this The food stall will be coining it at Loftus why are ppl arguing on here. lik it will mak any difference..lol. "@Robert Russell I really pray that NDZ do not become Deputy President Pravin Gordan will be deduty president @Jabu Malinga it is because the evidence being given today is rubbish..i dont get this english guy is saying..i think even the dcj is not following well.. Must go and protest where this Inauguration is taking place. Get your posters ready. 
1:13:52,1:16:20, the ANC has no will power to even try stamp out corruption! And they will spend more millions on the SONA after the Loftus shindig. Were the 1064 locomotives ever delivered? and was the gauge correct? Protest against the expenditure of this Inauguration. NDZ will save her ex husband from prosecution DD is waaay to influential to be ignored....but yes... lets hope then that the Zuma faction doesn't get that high up the leadership ladder in parly... we have ACE as SG with Jessie the lap dog as well I am sick in bed today but the commission is too important to miss "@ Magda Seguin surely that won’t happen if it does will create divisions coz women failed to backup candidates for deputy president what wil u ppl do if honourable SG Ace becomes no.2...hahahahahah 
1:16:33,1:19:57, Zondo is confaazed today what Happened to Hon Stive Masele @Val yes it is true bfore its too late @makhosi nobhtayi thanks for explaining..it gives a bit of hope Ramophosa surely cannot elect people who have been implicated in corruption in this commission of enquiry. Nomvula has been implicated @Lorna Kavanagh as far as I gathered it was never delivered but the money was never returned Val that's 85% of the ANC NDZ was captured and is linked to the Guptas. 
1:20:18,1:21:44, if President Rama exclude those who are implicated in this commission then the will be no one in parliament to represent the anc coz they are all corrupt he was not in but outside There will be no change ppl. get that out ya heads. Ramaphosa promised a lot of favors to win at Nasarec. DD and the like have to now be accommodated. Houston we have a problem "ramaphosa had all these months to make changes In some organization if you go or dont go its still an issue From what I understand... the ANC NEC makes up the list of members to parly.... the President picks his Cabinet from this list..... what makes u think he will suddenly appoint ppl who are not implicated how can you attend the meeting without being authorised to do so? english arrogance 
1:22:10,1:24:49, even he is implicated in som things lik marikana. small nyara skeletons. everybody has them why are the group of ministers called a cabinet? isn't it a cabaal "@Jabu Malinga you are right well these skeletons are out of the closet now @Jabu Malinga 😅 I agree @Felix Muyoba. He shouldn't have attended the meeting if he was not delegated by anyone. is this guy talking sense? he is way past hire expiry date. should have retired long ago "Ramaphosa hasn’t made any promises to any individuals One else in our movement 
1:24:53,1:26:36, But he has exceptional institutional knowledge...age is nothing Makings be careful and divert from your racist arrogance please. "zikalala in premier in kzn Malinga divert from your racist arrogance please. then when you don't go they email you about your absence @Jabu Malinga ...Question... What is the collective noun for a group of politicians?..... Answer...... A pack of lies 😃 😃 😃 some people ag @Jabu Malinga The president does not choose premiers. The NEC choose premiers from a list of 3 people that they get from the PEC. "mahumaphelo is still pulling strings in north west. is ramaphosa could 
1:26:43,1:29:15, "In Europe they are even recruiting ex Mayors etc. into EUCommission Boarss for their knowledge politian *Boards The nec supposed to have majority ramaphosa ppl in it. but it is obvious they hav to allow the other faction to also hav their ppl in their so ter is peace Politicians.. hmm 🤔more like Corruptioneers "when zuma was pres "What happen to Hon Stive Masele People who are outside of the ANC want to ANC to be frozen to pre-Nasrec positions. There have been contests before and people move on. Please non-ANC people allow us to move on. the motives for his business cases on s.a. rail systems was to align it to british system so that he brings more english people here.. 
1:29:38,1:31:55, I don't think there are any politicians in the ANC "You are bonkers @Felix Muyoba  rama margarine cant to much. he cant only try but the zuma faction still has som power and they are aligning themselves for a takeover in 5 years. watch this space KUBI !!! "Rob Davies of the Sri is not on the list..Patel also not *dti "@Khalid Mather he was recommending locomotives from australia Money for jam..R500m like it's nothing.. and miracles??? OMF..... Rob Davies not on the list..... I think we are going to have even more challenges.... @Magda Seguin 
1:32:00,1:35:36, People who are outside of the ANC want to freeze the ANC to pre-Nasrec positions. There have been contests before and people move on. Please non-ANC people allow us to move on. "Im not supporting this old man in his confusion and forgetfulness  I don't believe this man is confused but you are Rob kept the dti on a tight leash even with illicit tobacco smugglers wanting to bribe his staff "You are educated STATE CAPTURE @Khalid Mather true "there have been 100s of ppl implicated in this  The ANC is the party of the peoples of south africa and the is no argument about that i decided that those who want to see a bright future should all join the ANC the party for all south african 
1:35:56,1:37:15, @Jabu Malinga the answer is simple.... NPA = NEVER PROSECUTE THE ANC Arrests will be forth coming this commission is listening to the testimony of witnesses first. But I also believe there is a concerted effort in the 21st century that spread ageism...making older people out to be fools is not intelligent at all.Sages are to be respected. Linda Mti was arrested so it is not true that only Agrizzi was arrested agrissi was d guy arrested. how com? why nobody else? ramaphoria is a smokescreen. no high ranking politician or politically connected person wil go to jail @Andrew Mboweni ..future without electricity.. contradictory😂😁😀 Linda Mti @Jabu Malinga I think Agrizzi was arrested so that he wouldn't testify at that commission which was dealing with Snake and Snail. Jiba and Mwerebi should have been arrested and charged for obstruction of justice 
1:37:17,1:39:50, WE MUST ARREST PW BOTHA FROM HIS GRAVE FOR NOT LIGITIMATING A BLACK FELLOW "this comm will take another 2 years. cost 100s of millions "The arrests include Patrick Gillingham lik arms deal.. a long comm for arms deal. who went to jail??? don't fool yourselves ppl. these commissions are a waste. evidence is ter. if npa wanted they could prosecute.no need for commision #Dilip Badal THE FUTURE IS VERY BRIGHT FOE ALL THE SOUTH AFRICAN WHO WERE PART OF APARTHEID IN WHICH ALL BLACKS WERE NOT REGARDED AS HUMANS @Jabu Malinga absolutely spot on Agrizzi was a witness as well as his involvement in corruption . Agrizzi was not the only Bossasa member arrested. They knew the consequences prior to testifying. the money trace is ter. estina dairy scandal. has anyone gon to jail??? WE ABSOLUTELY DISAGREE WITH PEOPLES WHO ARE CRITICS OF THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS 
1:39:57,1:41:59, "plane landing at waterkloof "Zuma had the NPA in his pocket for 9 years hence no arrests or prosecutions..the evidence is clear Then don't be on this chat site because there are plenty of critics of the ANC Why are you shouting @Andrew Mboweni "Jonas bride For R54Bn could we not have built these loco's ourselves and enjoy the spin off's that this would have created by way of jobs etc?????? "thoshan panday and madhoo caught briding general booysen.. was panday arrested. no @Robert Russell there I agree with you @Jabu Malinga...ask Jiba and Mwerebi...Zuma's lackeys 
1:42:29,1:44:06, "PW BOTHA  I blame people like @Jabu Malinga for what happened with the Estina case All these investigations were halted due to the corrupt prosecutors in the NPA and Jiba. They will be resurrected You obviously have not listened to McBride and Gen.Booysens testimonies "all this evidence in this commission You guys are giving me a headache "the ANC brought SA to it's knees. The majority of ANC supporters are rural illiterate. They are ""bought"" with free T-shirts and food the week leading up to the election." @Jabu Malinga Has stopped saying only Agrizzi has been arrested and he now acknowledges that 'just a few bosasas went to court'. "yes 
1:44:54,1:46:25, 6 months versus 10 years? are you listening to your own argument? "Andrew those are long dead i am talking about the recent killers like janusz walusz who killed comrade chris hani for fighting for the liberation Seated to the right of Ms Sello is who please? "nothing will happen.. and those wanting an argument and a fight "SA is a constitutional democracy that was looted for 10 years now you want swift justice without getting watertight cases is anyone listening to this guy..hahahaha Comrade @Andrew Mboweni you won't get anywhere with people who makes up their own facts like @Jabu Malinga did you manage to download the paper @Felix Muyoba ? 
1:46:53,1:48:47, Talk with yourself @Jabu Malinga "no facts brother we have to inaugurate the president after that the SONA in which he is addressing the nation telling them about the programs of government of the day that is how government function telling and words don't count..actions count @Khalid Mather what paper? yeah.... @Andrew Mboweni ....for a R100 MILLION... "Hayi maan  "rama can talk for days. ppl want action. he said his goin to bring jobs.. when @Jabu Malinga i will be very patient and educate him about how government operate or function and government makes money as i can see that he doesnt understand 
1:49:17,1:52:19, @Felix Muyoba I uploaded it for you all @Robert Russell how much was the budget for FW DE KLERK and PW BOTHA S INAUGURATION 5 millions rand 500 million rands and it was attended by all whites "Race baiting again total costs of FW DE KLERK AND PW BOTHA INAUGURATION WAS 500 MILLIONS RANDS Zondo is starting to get to my nerves the way he is so hard on Ms Sello. Nesmilnyana dololo ithi ingane iyamdlalisa. Lobaba maar! Stop shouting please Aaaaaaaa...the Race will Always be played by Some People....especially the bitter and twisted ones....hey.. 
1:52:55,1:58:13, let us not remain in the past the new president of south africa is cyril matamela ramaphosa for a non racial society as it is enshrined in the constitution of this country "I am a reasonable person ..but changing to g#tvol...wait for election The problem with the NDP – which from 2009-14 was managed by former Finance Minister TrevorManuel & Cyril Ramaphosa (Zuma replacement as president) – was its fetish for corporate‘extractivist’growth. politically south africa is a decent country that one should be proud of we must carry this brand south africa everywhere we go "Matemela is a neoliberalist  "Take it up with the ruling party the brand that we must carry or the working slogan towards south africa #THUMA MINA #Magda Seguin "Register on Polity.org and the Parliamentary Monotoring Group (PMG) get involved and give your opinion

Asiy'funi iAgenda Yama Capitalist "I was already there as an ordinary citizen @Andrew Mboweni the EFF is not a political party but a company for julius malema to get paid a salary #Magda Seguin welldone what a great efforts "Thank you 
2:05:08,2:10:03, at the time you are put to the test he will provide a way out "The ANC wanted fracking in the Karoo @Magda Seguin ...spot on. We All need to prosper and have a better future.....All Of Us. we are citizens of all experience and qualifications who are at any level doing their best to serve the south africans and our government is an inclusive one in which iam very proud of the ANC "Shell had to pull out of wanting to do fracking in SA "The Karoo is a water poor area And I am sure if fracking was allowed a lot more state capture was going to happen knowing what I learnt from this commission many companies were given the rights to do business in south africa through foreign direct investments which is mostly enshrined in the trade and industry blueprints as we are open as a country "you think fracking is bad aunty Magda  
2:10:10,2:19:02, "We should all have one focus and we must be in advance and look forward to a sustainable development south africa and walks as far as in technology and innovations and we must not tolerate those who uses their experience or access to higher offices of the land to showcase themselves as better than the other everyone voted so we must treat each others equally and i cannot comment about if i ever took myself to parliament but i am with the peoples of south africa and i hate those who oppress others as a means of superior logic or supremacy this is not the time for one to be a sugarcane grower but tobe a sugar manufacturer to be a manufacturer of the technology that will be used by total in that failed project of fracking at karoo to be part of the telescope engineer at the northern cape telescope and that is the south africa we need tomorrow @Dilip Badal -You had candles prior 1994 why act like you know He sounds like a locomotive !

2:19:42,2:56:21, THE LEADERSHIP FOR THE AFRICA WE WANT 95 locomotives You had better stock up with candles because the lights will go out in June "Thank you for the info @Khalid Mather I certainly will have a look "@Andrew Mboweni you are correct Ramaphosa is tainted. He cannot act against corrupt officials for fear of backlash. The locos supplied by CSR would not be identical to those to be supplied.. simple 🚂🚃 "@Randall Lewis Not all of us have bought into the Ramaphoria. Only when Zuma and Magashule are in jail 
2:59:54,3:18:42, @Derek Main .......You are 100% spot on.......only then...will i start to believe. Only then will i have faith in this Gov. Why is this commission of inquiry not aired on all SABC channels From my memory of the TRC it was seen by SA citizens this friend of @Val Speirs is lost @Derek Main 100% agree!! In this case they never got to see the pig @Lee Hendrix Or they thought they were getting a pig and got a dog instead haha yes
