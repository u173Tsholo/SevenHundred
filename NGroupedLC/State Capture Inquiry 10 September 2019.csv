"@Jane .Blamire this is going to be a comedy day its definitely going to be entertaining. Bet it will be a bumper day for how many watch today! I'm just here waiting for Hlaudi to be honest. Mr 90% When is the Breakfast Show starting? Hlaudi 'The Artful Dodger'' clowny is an entertaining chap.😀 
-0:22,9:43, Agree Rubin. He tends to ramble especially on his favourite subject....Hlaudi.😂😀😂😀 Witness looks nervous... 90%local content. Hlaudi the Man Mr 90%This should be interesting.. entertaining rather. He sounds scared lol Where’s Maleka?
