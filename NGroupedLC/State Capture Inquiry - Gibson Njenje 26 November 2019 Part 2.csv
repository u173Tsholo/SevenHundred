Ask Vytjie 
45:07,49:00, if Zuma is innocent then I will head back to being dumb. VBS owns the mines Zuma is corrupt just like all the ANC comrades but you just have to find evidence to pin it to him which is a difficulty at this point!! Mshini Wham Mmm unamanga lo baba 🤔 There is a lie somewhere here he seems to be speaking lies "No lies why is the witness so incoherent? 
49:04,50:32, There’s lies mixed with truths here wasn't this guy in the intelligence? Definitely more than 3 of them were present He was @Sekgololo. . . "@Sekgololo Johannes I just love that word -- incoherent ... In intelligence but not very intelligent

Lakshmi Mittal is a self made respectable man from my understanding Mittal Steel who pillages the pristine SA beaches Jindal Steel All operate in Africa Pity we don't do anything to change things @Khanyi. AgeGracefully Are you a lie dictator????????? 
1:01:57,1:04:36, "How did Ramaphosa become rich?????""" he won powerball How is that relevant? McDonalds @nhlanhla nkosi 😀😁🤣😂😁😀 "The same nutcase who gave Guptas access to Eskom how did he get 300m macdonalds I am beginning to wonder just how many millions rands the ANC cadres and ministers and Guptas could have made with insider trading knowing in advance who was to be fired and appointed? BEE company. he won the franchise for SA and maybe large parts of Africa 
1:05:18,1:09:00, @Michael Wild We all eat Mcdonald but we are not rich😀😁😂😁😂 "Mike Clark you est. he earns from that eat @Michael Wild We all eat Mcdonald but we are not rich😀 He must be investigated as well McRamahosa triple Marikana burger special! do you understand what I said. CR owns the rights to McDonalds through SA. each time anyone eats McDonalds product. CR gets a little of it. work out how many items are eaten a day in SA. We will die poor 
1:10:23,1:12:34, .......or New Dawn double with fries! @Michael Wild Cyril made deals under the table behind our backs now he is rich @Mbuso Ndlovu Have faith we can solve the problem Black Friday special at McRam's!

Mbuso can this one be concluded 1st before we look at other conspiracy theories This is going to be interesting! While some fellow South African sleep in shacks with empty stomachs 
1:13:38,1:17:00, who's fault is it that they sleeping in shacks 90 percent??????????????????????? @nhlanhla nkosi Those greedy bastads Guptas were acting like boss now their stomach was bigger and bigger We should all get a slice of the cake not a few wat was stolen in the past 9 yrs could have solved that if the thieves were stopped in 2011 as per Mo same forcing process used to take over the coal supplies to Exdom. until they had the full supply line of coal to Exdom Mr zondo is a real judge "Guptas skellem 
1:17:26,1:22:48, @Mbuso it's fine go to mc and buy a big Mac I guess that's bigger than the slice u want @Muzamani Ronald what u mean?? Who is a fake judge??? 😂😂😂😂 My best advice is...Do not Start anything that is Corruption..even if its as small as a salt grain...ey "Bonke has anyone been able to find a link btw these Guptas and the Gupta involved with cricket match fixing - (Hansie Cronje)?? Bro..it catches up with one later on Guptaz raped us as a nation Guptas is a common surname in India.

"Shame yourself  
1:37:52,1:42:14, Zuma utter the same explanation to the ANC when he was asked to drop Guptas 🤪🤪🤪 "I can imagine Nxamalala saying Wim Louw please don't be personal # Zondo Commission MUST FALL!

1:46:48,1:50:04, @Tumi Sereme would you bet money on him being innocent? I would. Judge Zondo is a straight arrow.

Hope you guys are working the thief Bongo did not waist time to tell the committee about his corrupt activities that he would submit himself to legal processes adding he will cooperate with investigation
