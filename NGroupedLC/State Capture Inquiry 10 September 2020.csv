Lord have mercy. father please destroy this ANC once and for all. @Wesley Myburgh Ahmen "can anybody tell me "Well Austin Martin 
1:08:38,1:12:38, the anc knows how to keep their supports in the dark our only hope to save South Africa & aspire to a Madiba & Martin Luther King future is the DA. do not fixate on Zille & other alleged racists as racists exists across the ethnic divide "@Wesley Myburgh F fall same as the previous ministers "on a positive note since its tea break "You have to remember that in 1994 gta "nice "well cant afford yet lol "dont worry Mr Wesley Myburgh once the new electoral law is passed 
1:12:59,1:16:07, @Fred Desrosiers goes to show money can turn the mos righteous heart dark My feeling is today's witness will try to contradict everyone. What she stated so far has no bearing on how State Capture occured Tefo a V Klein who was on the Escom board. Welcome to SABC all you ENCA guys..... thank you:virtualhug::virtualhug::virtualhug: i hate enca @Akhonamandla Gala 🤣 thanks Akhonamandla ENCA cabal in the house lol i hate all news outlets

Judge Zondo looks flabbergasted and lacks the enthusiasm he showed during Tsotsi's testimony. indeed Teddy 🤣🤣 
1:28:07,1:37:08, She's running the show she is talking the judge deurmekaar mos that's why bring in Kate I m waiting when someone is arrested only then I will believe the inquiry was real Teddy I get the same impression @abedi vivi the estina crooks appear in court today by the time anyone gets convicted they're gonna either be dead or to old is Ace still in Zimbabwe? Until further notice.......or ZC is finished. 
1:37:08,1:43:35, "Poor Judge Eskom was being runned like a shoddy company hehehe @Hlagala. Ace is still in Zimbabwe. To receive lessons on how to destroy a country 😂😂😂 "@Akhonamandla Gala Nah man... the enca chat is the absolute worst... people are toxic and think they own the platform Mr Tsotsi ........... So Miss Klein did not know the difference between a board and an induction meeting. the chair is hungry "In fact so many people have blocked me that side for standing up for this other chick 
1:43:48,1:49:24, Anyway... who is in the hot seat today? Hopefully Ace will see the light .. but not holding my breath. not everyone can get the zuma treatment..everyone else shall sing and throw each other under the bus Oh I see thanks @Frank Jordaan a b c 100% "uBaba Totally bs Skelm & co who is sure..who knows anything 
1:49:58,1:52:18, why is she looking into the ceiling @derek looking for answers "Dudu Myeni seems to have been ""our first lady"" over the years. WOW." i thought so too "lol they didnt want that big head to eat alone  yes @ Funicanz Dudu dangerous Big Python She looks at the ceiling because she needs help from above she's starting mixing sugar and Sand 😂😂😂
