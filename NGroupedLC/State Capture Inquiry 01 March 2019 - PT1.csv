1:07:27,1:10:25, Yeesssss. @Thando Nkutha Somebody has to lay a complaint to the Public Protector before she can investigate. Some journalists were starting to ask questions but nobody complained. Thanks Joel @Thando Nkutha Why do you say Maties is racist? Do you study there? Eskom has had upgrades all the way infrastructure. The coal is an Outsourcing issue So load shedding is a Management not Technical concern. Planning/ plant management @Thando Nkutha please provide all the facts. @Makho Theo loadshedding is both technical and managerial 
1:10:56,1:14:06, "@JS Bach @Joel currently it’s only a financial issue It's about how the Generation executives allocate incentives to plant managers @Eslon Eslon somebody still has to make a complaint. Ask any Eskom field worker @Thando Nkutha I can't believe it. How do you know she was refused based on the colour of her skin? peaches I think it’s time to bit this chat to stick to the State inquiry Lol 😆

Looks very competent in his position at Eskom. plucked Guys have realize that ndz faction of the ANC are invisible and reluctant to help CR 17 to unite and renew the party. instead they are in courts fighting their own movement "They must hurry lol spelling cold* Elson they are fighting back
