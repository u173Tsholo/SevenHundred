Remember according to Ace Magashule there is nothing wrong to do business with the government while you're a leader or official of the state üòâ Duduzane became a Billionaire while his father was in office through government tenders via the Guptas. This country is not going to heal anytime soon. Pricing is like the cost of a new car - How much will the suckers pay? never mind cost plus margin

1:19:31,1:30:03, The current presenter and the expert earlier in the week is the same but differ with the approach to do assessment. Mr Manyike What happens here is that corrupt people worked with those knows the job so that they can beef up their corrupt activities and succeed in their looting. what has this verbiage garbage got to do to bring the anc criminals and guptas to book? :washhands::washhands: Explain we are listening. some body is going to take his watch when he gets outside üòÅ its too much aced

1:38:20,1:40:47, R15M is more than enough for me chair. "It is clear here that the Mr Manyike knows the work "I wish the president appointed Advocate Thuli Mandonsela to chair the inquiry into the covid19 investigation rather RONALD LAMOLA "Show us the balance sheets He said his own profit was R15mill and he didn't even cringe? "@andrew - totally agree "we cant have ANC investigating ANC it is truelly like throwing a pig into a mud pit expecting it to be clean  u are right Andrew Mboweni. Thulie Madonsela would have acted without fear or favor I want to be the middle man! 
1:40:56,1:45:07, I agree with you Andrew Yoh this guy is about to spill the beans on Mastertrade "if cyril ramaphosa is serious about corruption people of south africa are watching and time will tell if there was a change in governance  There goes Mastertrade - thrown under the bus TN u the reason most of people work in sandton it is because since 1994 the ANC Produced businessman are self feeding themselves while hard working white south african are helping us more the ANC "'Social Facilitator"" this role is very interesting chair" A Social Facilitator = JZ's boeta "@Andrew not for ""Gomora"" only the entire Country." 
1:46:20,1:49:09, yhoo now social facilitation is about taking of politics. ü§îü§î "Where can I apply for being a ""Social Facilitator"" to make up to R15M profit" "Most of south african citizens have their trust on our white fellow citizens they are very helpful and caring than the ANC led government  and he says Eeyü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ I died ü§£ü§£ü§£ Social facilitator is nonsense created by government people to benefit from tenders nothing else. Stop scoring own goals Mr... "This man is too honest cartels "south africans must wake up now and be serious about leaders who steals from 1994 to 2020 this is a shame on the poor  
1:49:16,1:51:18, I'm afraid he will never gets any tenders from government hi Mr Zondo doing his great job but no actions has been taken so far. I found these Manyike is shifting a blame to other we need to arrest them all whether is defending himself or not High level social facilitator?? His honesty is needed as we know lot of people who are connected they benefit like that through these tenders. Social facilitator! "he does not need to work any more now is the time ANC LEADERS will face ANC members as it was quoted by former president Thabo Mbeki there are so many thieves stealing each an everyday he was paid. a lot of money just to facilitate lol

Ace the thug must go to jail as per Mr. Mxolisi Dukwana. blame it on the dead you can see this just a lie what this guy is saying Easy to pass blame to the dead "Follow up on the partner HOW DO U GET THE CONTRACT TO DO THE JOB IF U CANT DO THE JOB Guys! being corrupt is actually reasonable. Don't u think? 
4:16:29,4:17:13, Assets Forfeiture Unit should be ready to act on this man immediately and get back the millions stolen from taxpayers kitty. Vengeance belongs to The Lord. These criminals will receive the appropriate consequences for their actions. THE PPL R GIVEN TENDERS WHERE THEY KNOW NOTHING OF AND THEY OUTSOURCE IT "Rather than discussing what we all know  "Adv Pretorious is the player of the week for me partner and yet not party to discussions??? Being corrupt is more than reasonable if there is no accountability. """i was never involved""" Liquidation is the route 
4:17:43,4:18:52, Such a big contract and he knows nothing? doritos 3d It didn't take long for Adv P to crack Mr Sodi The worst people are those who made sure there is no accountability - Zuma and Ramaphosa come to mind.

Without COMMON SENSE all the education in the world won't help!!! WE NEVER WANTED BEE WE JUST WANTED EQUAL OPPOTURNITIES Whoever votes for anc has no right to complain about corruption because it has been known for too many years that anc is severely corrupted. @skeetpetegibbs - not me "The Lord helps those who help themselves Jacob* 
4:23:02,4:26:13, your right education wont help against sanctions THE MOST ANNOYING THING THESE BEE BOYS THINK YHEY R INTELEGENT "We know that Jacob Zuma was stealing money Mr. Sodi just admit that you overcharged because that was actually TUNNELLING to Ace Akhonamandla Gala President Ramaphosa has no authority to fire Ace Magashule. Ace isn't a cabinet minister. He is the SG elected by the masses of the ANC. It's probably the NEC that could recall him Eeeeeerhm.... eeeeeerhm.... errrhm RAMAPHOSA CANNOT DO ANYTHING HIS DUCKS R NOT INORDER HIMSELF LOL "Zakhele say that again WE NOT FOR BABYLON MY BROTHER
