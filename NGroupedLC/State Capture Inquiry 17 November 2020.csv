That’s why I say Government must be 50%% black50% white. White can assist to control Europe and America. Us He claims there are lizard people running the world and that he is jesus? You think that is a credible source? sup @see earth freedom of speech I tell you. @See Earth @Kelly Jurgens The reptilians and the NWO.I went thru that phase 
-20:34,-18:32, i dont think any1 here qualified enough to talk this amount of trash "By all means david ick is a fraudster who is simply making money out of those gullible enough to believe his rubbish @ see earth so you disagree that the NWO does not run the world? Free earth - really? Let’s agree to agree on that. You have your views which I won’t say you lost credibility about. "Hi @Kieron Sinewave We are discussing the future of the world and conspiracy theories which are Does this means Zuma is not going to testify at all now. Because he's playing delaying tactics @Heather Durr ye i got it 😕 "I agree that NWO is indeed a conspiracy theory 
-17:44,-14:51, @see earth so do you believe that the 'Pandemic' exist? "@Kieron Sinewave you would be an imbecile to think otherwise. I have lost friends and family "David Icke is educated man LOL! "imagine if everyone did their job and only spoke about what they know 😆 😆 speculation is awesome "Yhoo @bongile sango Hi Zuma's applications will all be rejected as per the blatant blackmail by his counsel [altho it is the obvious path]. I hope they have other witnesses tor this week This diversion tactic will backfire Zuma won't say anything useful 
-14:08,-10:43, @Heather Durr I agree they should have some spare witnesses lined up "Heather @Teunis van Ree it's what he doesn't say that will be most revealing Mr Place- Spot on Same as with Dudu. Adv Pretorius's propositions will stand @Heather I think this week was scheduled for him.I also wish they've maid an arrangements for other witness. @Maritime Studies @Teunis van Ree There is no reason not to interrogate Zuma pending the applications. I doubt his counsel will allow it. "I am not agains the. COmmission Another session of 'non incrimination' will be fun but Pretorius is not as aggressive and quick as Kate and Myburg 
-10:08,-3:54, @Teunis van Ree They dont have to say anything usefull. Its about the questions that the commision is putting to whim with proof @FieliesSA correct If they had any sense they would have realised that Zuma would not testify under any circumstances. They should have witnesses lined up @Maritime...true..all the SIU reports were sitting with the Hawks before the commission was even thought of...prosecute...rather than waist money. I so wish the billion has been spent here can't be like waste. we want to see the results "They still have to ask him the questions """if not you "Bongile @Heather Durr GM

2:03,3:05, @Thapelo Juluka I think that the honourable Mr Zondo has no fear. Zondo must not recuse himself. Zuma must go take a dump. "Kelly Jurgens "@M Place you are totally correct.
