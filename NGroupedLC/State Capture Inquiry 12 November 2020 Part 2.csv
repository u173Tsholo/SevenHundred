How many years ago is he talkin about EFF does not even appear on the scoreboard I think now Adv Kennady (and DCJ) are talking from an ivory tower. The arms industry is a very messy business.

Mr Kennedy is getting started and is grilling the witness badly @Lerato Moleke he is deeper in than he is admitting I don't know how their loss to the FF+ can be explained as 'identity politics'. so actually he is innocent 🤔 @Lerato Moleke Heehehehehe mr Burger's frustration against LNT was genuine. he is just defeated by the Policy issue 
1:07:57,1:09:13, EFF need new leaders...Malema and even *shem Ndlozi lost the plot...no tact. @Mzalwane Mzala - only they know I dont think the DA knows who their supporters are @ALTA No he is not.

1:10:01,1:11:22, @Megan Diedericks Unfortunately DA took their supporters for granted. They neglected their principles in their hunt for power. That's where Mmusi failed them. There is a fine line and it seems he landed on the wrong side. Is there more than just error here?? @MIKE DURBAN not impressed and not laughing either. try agian "...Global economies are experiencing a currency value reset I agree chair....why did not loose points for their high price????? this guy can sell freezers to Eskimos Error in judgment chair... @Mangaliso .... im not a racist at all a believe every crook must pay.... so please dont put wrong words in my mouth @Tickle McVetkoek ......shame.....what's up.....don't like the jokes...or the truth...maybe...... 
1:11:37,1:13:20, @Dominic Przybylski - so in other words back to the drawing board when the ANC provincial administrators took over the Tswane from the DA in an illegal take over earlier this year the city of Tswane had a R429 million surplus. @MIKE DURBAN pls stop the harrassment. I am paying attention here. Apologies @MIKE DURBAN Forgot to greet you earlier! hindsight is a wonderful thing🙄🙄 since the DA got the city back through the high Court they found a R 4.4 billion deficit in Tswane b mrrText you copy will automatically show here @ALTA yes he is @Tickle McVetkoek ......then don't watch the chats...simple...ne
