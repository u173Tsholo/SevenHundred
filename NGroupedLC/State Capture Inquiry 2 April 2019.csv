19:26,22:14, "@Bogartman Mntlane Oh yes "@Desmond Masilela for sure He even gave an interview saying he don't know who paid for it I saw now evidence will be given about Ace getting 80million ...and the ANC defends him the CR17 faction is now vulnerable @Cameron Kim. Do you have any idea who are they referring to when the witness say 'She? Grayboy link please or is it only allegations "@Quintin Jacobs CR17 and all are in the same boat @Quintin Jacobs but those guys are sly..they know how to fool the electorate 
22:47,25:05, "@Desmond Masilela it is the lady running the house - I have her name in my file @Quinton check news24 Cameron Kim might be but using your analogy then DA is also corrupt cause here in the CAPE they orchestrated the water crisis @Cameron Kim. thank you Cameron. "@Desmond Masilela ""She"" is not involved in the corruption" It is beyond my understanding how anyone can think that Judge Zondo would allow illegal inspections... @Cameron Kim. I thought it was Mantashe's wife? @Quintin Jacobs The water problem is the result of the useless ANC and DA politician . The last proper dams were build in Apartheid "@seguin

28:41,30:41, ‚Äã@Quintin Jacobs In 1992 the NP planned a water pipeline from the Orange river to 3 WD . The ANC then said it was wasting money @Desmond Masilela no problem Robert please dont label ppl if they not sheep ppl @peter pott you really think an entire team of prosecutors and investigators will open themselves up to illegal activity? Please don't speculate I did visit the dam Russ Adv. Molefe is my all day every day crush... üòç Steenbras is full So you think the DA pulled the plug in the dam to manufacture a crises???? @Quintin Jacobs Steenbras dam full? that will be cool. 
30:43,32:35, Robert so tell me why did the DA charge ordinary folk more water than business in the Cape "@Quintin Jacobs the WC is short of water since 1996 after the mass emigration from the EC  I remember in Mr Mlambo's previous testimony he alluded to implicated people being notified It's not only the voice. .. but she is just beautiful. She deserves a marriage certificate. Send the address. .... "@seguin Robert if you think there is a plug in the dam then you would be the only one @Quintin Jacobs The DA is same as ANC and EFF Cameron Kim you so right but the DA led government here used the water crisis the milk the ordinary person @kim and the same as you

34:56,38:53, @Thando Nkutha. Thank you Thando @Robert Russell The DA is just as quilty as the ANC. They never addressed the water problem coming and that all were aware of since 1994 @Thando Nkutha. I see thank you. Robert they did indeed - coining day ZERO my word ppl in the WC not the leafy subs is and are having day zero for years The DA have only been in power in the WC for 10 years... so beg to differ... look at the sate of ESKOM and that's pure ANC leadership.... as is the water situation which is a national competency. Can anyone out there tell me why I should vote? @African u r correct @Robert Russell...some are brainwashed by BLF/EFF propaganda "constitution is a two edge sword. used both to protect the plaintiff and defendant. both investigator and one being investigated. accused and accuser. sad 
39:48,43:27, Robert on ESKOM did you read the article of how ESKOM created the loadshedding euphoria so that ESKOM must fork out 14.5 trillion rand on coal contracts those implicated were w88te folk @African yes Nomvula and Vincent ' s houses @Michael Holmes you can vote or do not vote.

1:12:18,1:13:55, Do we need another two nuclear power stations now because Eskom is pelile? I font know why South Africans are not outraged by the ANC making the country a failed state @Thando Nkutha i agree with you. But you first need to demonstrate an illegal action. Gwede was SG of ANC. He was not in a position to provide any tender to Bosasa. So what's the illegal relationship? This guy was trying to hide some INFO "@peter pott you are right  this guy is the weakest link. haikhonaüòïüòïüòï "Why do we have legal team if they not advising investigators "80m was found in the boot of ANC government official in Free State earlier this year LISTEN ALL PEOPLE = BOSASA IS A SMALL FISH IN THE ANC CORRUPT WORLD 
1:13:57,1:15:56, Give credit to this man. He's Very articulate & uses language & turns of phrase that suggests he has extreme clarity of thought before he answers. More educated than many people I know. I'm impressed "@Peter pott...you have all the answers it seems.I rest my case.Up till now the NPA Cameron kim you are just a hatred of the president I cannot help accept that Ramaphosa has done nothing wrong even his son disclosed contract which he did job for Bosasa as small company he run Our data r chowed 4 naught "Ace @makhosi nobhatyi i HATE CORRUPTION AND PEOPLE STEALING TAX MONEY AND THE FUTURE OF SA. CR17 IS A CON ARTIST "@Thando Nkutha i agree. But they can always go get a warrant and do inspection again.

1:16:16,1:19:37, @makhosi nobhatyi CR Holds the light for ANC's rivival and ppl knows that hence the hatred @carnoth ngomane agree CR17 kick the can down the corridor for a few more years . Why is ACE there if he is serious Cameron kim you are out of order brother Ramaphosa didn‚Äôt even benefit and you heard how that happened so why you accusing him? can 1 tell me what is David Mabuza's involvement in the corruption? is he clean? we been taken as fools as South Africans and been promised a lot but non is done...ANC is the root of all corruption it must fall down...and let EFF take over.. @makhosi nobhatyi hahaha you must be delusional the my brother. The ANC is a shame - everything they do go up in smoke \ @African Refugee yes I dont see any valid testimony given by this witness sorry "African refugee state security agencies was captured by Zuma

Ayi i dont think so. but rather let me not judge. @Thando Nkutha yes its mediocrity at its best "@African Refugee the DA wanted to bring charges against people like Gwede and Nomvula 
1:23:01,1:27:46, @Dimakatso Tshinaba. Thank you. Why is that if I may ask "@makhosi nobhatyi You are using the ANC strategy of ""If you tell a lie often enough Only a fool signs something when behaving illegally. Which is why Gavin Watsons signature isnt on one document.... when you comment out of hatred you usually ignore the facts and allow your hatred to speak He tricked Agrezzi and them into signing. According to Gwede his upgrades where done by whomever the ANC got to do them... He didnt know he was getting Bosasa upgrades apparently. But I dont believe anyone I can barely hear when they speak... he mumbles like a drunk and so I dont trust him... "Briony French this Bosasa thing was mafia within the state taking advantage to blackmail people such as Mantashe @Dimakatso Tshinaba. Are you no f/b? "@Briony French i think if the relationship was reciprocal Bosasa must have benefited from Gwede 
1:28:52,1:35:19, I think Mantashe when he comes to clarify matters then we connect dots this is how whites operate...if they can beat them the accuses them any wrong doing.....the big fish of this capture are the opperneihms who are running equal with the ruppers....and own a private air @James According to Agrizzi they were either being paid a monthly fee by Bosasa or receiving other benefits eg. home security. same thing around hlaudi... what did he give bosasa that they paid 1m to his lawyers ALL our SOE's are bankrupt because of the ANC but people still believe in flying fairies...it seems like the betrayal of a population is a narcissistic desire of the abused people why is all the witnesses are white There are so many ANC corruption denialits on this thread....enjoy yourselves üôÜüôÜüôÜ @kleophas max what are you talking about?

"Sofia Sofia It sounds like recap of the upgrade visits to the Bosasa payees (Mantase can these guys just admit already they received bribes..the evidence is too much 
2:17:27,2:19:27, @Kapn Krunch seriously? Blocked Van Lier....no time for Mr Nobody empty vessel. @Sthakathi Khumalo Why we recapping this crap ! #Thankyou "SOUTH AFRICANS Watson was putting Agrizzi in mud nhe yes I as a white will openly say that I have a shop at four ways where 90% of the staff are illegally in our country @Sofia Sofia there is no point to the last 2 days. Irrelevant evidence I think Apartheid succeeded in making South Africans hate each other "@makhosi nobhatyi Agrizzi was chief of operations 
2:19:31,2:20:48, Mantashe...when is he going to appear??? @Sofia Sofia this witness and the other investigator are corroborating each other‚Äôs evidence as well as Agrizzi evidence @Kapn Krunch but why are you have 90% foreigners as opposed to citizens? you are also wrong "James Its true I dont own the shop I supply them with goods It‚Äôs a necessary exercise @Renee Lane they are not corroborating Agrizzi's evidence. These people have never denied having security systems installed @Magda Seguin THE Government makes us to hate each other deviating from all the corruption they involved in ! @Magda....you are so right! But our current Governing Party the ANC with the help of the EFF (aka the ANCYL) is also further dividing our Nation. 
2:20:56,2:22:25, @Kapn Krunch why do you do that given that they are illegal immigrants? @Kapn Krunch what goods are you supplying you cant see that people coming and working here illegally is hurting south Africans @Renee Lane #Thankyou @James #Thankyou "america was and is being made great by foreigners @Sthakathi Khumalo All they are corroborating that there are existing security systems at these properties. However no one has denied this. Gwede even took journalists on a tour some time ago of it. DOES all this talk have evidence ? SOUTH AFRICANS YOU ARE BACK WARD IN YOUR THINKING.i feel pity for you. 
2:22:26,2:25:07, those foreigners shouldn't be running to America they should be making their home great not america "isn't it like ""seeing is believing  And they got to America legally Seems like the witness is not using spectacle either to read nor to see. His glass are far from the his eyes "@Kapn Krunch if we are living in a global village 90% OF BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS ARE PRIMITIVE IN MIND @James And it might be the equipment which can be physically verified (as opposed to the cash money which was paid) on which the NPA can bring charges. @Kapn Krunch of course there are bad apples but not all foreigners are bad..they south africa fresh minds I dont have any problem with foreigners I have a problem with illegals 
2:25:17,2:26:20, Do politicians experience Loadshedding ? or are they exempted ?

2:28:50,2:30:10, "I don't know @Desmond Masilela DCJ is short-sighted and does not have bi-focal glasses. His glasses correct his distance vision and he takes them off to read. I do the same thing. what angle? @Sofia Sofia There are 46 parties that registered...take your pick "@Barry Lungu i dont support xenophobia at all  sometimes these lawyers also ask irrelevant questions @Anne M. . Really? Hello ppl...what have I missed and who is in question today? @Anne M...that is why I have multifocals 
2:30:12,2:32:03, @Desmond Masilela Yes can you not concentrate on what the guy is saying instead of discussing his glasses? I agree! @Anne M. . Oh oky then. I was told a few minutes ago that Gavin Watson is in Dubai "@Anne M. it is still irrelevant. Unless the ""payment"" was for something in return." @Niematullah Rakeep I am listening just fine thanks. IS this guys testimony going to bring the petrol price down ? "@Cameron Kim  
2:32:17,2:32:51, that petrol hike is madness now we are paying for eskom through all these other mediums R1.37 is madness The previous woman that testified will her testimony bring the electricity tariff down ? no.it might go up next month.lokl @Thando Nkutha.

I also thought it was energy drinker "carnoth ngomane Yes yes I reckon...Dubai is where all the Money is being kept.

2:39:16,2:42:21, Yes Duma ...animal it is. no one is righteous in politics merely because no one holds them to account they have no fear look at Zuma and Mugabe still walking around what do they have to fear WE ARE FAILING AT CORRUPTION ...
