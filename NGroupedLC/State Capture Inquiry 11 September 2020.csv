Morning All I am betting a cold one that our friend Ben is not going to pitch......he has a big mouth and talks out of both sides and enriched himself handsomely "Dr Ben Ngubani "@Wesley Myburgh: Part of the problem is that we Africans follow ideologies we don’t understand "@Resident @Wesley Myburgh: then we have an excuse of being racially discriminated against. The ANC are the liberators and as such are entitled to plundering state coffers. The list of excuses is endless.

The ANC captured the state the Gupta board hhay must be nice. ouch!! welcome to Gupta associate Dr Ben 
14:37,18:16, But we can change the jockey yet the horse is the main problem. What is required is a system and environment that makes it possible for even a donkey to run the country.

18:35,23:32, butternut 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 is he a doctor by profession ? 😂😂 connections. this should be intersesting Our biggest pitfall is our belief that education and religion are the answers to our challenges. Look at the CVs of most managers in SEOs. Very impressive CVs but not competent enough. Now he is trying to motivate the contract with McKinsey "Integrity can’t be taught Lorna remember that McKinsey agreed to pay back the R1 billion in fees because it was tainted money. 
23:41,25:48, this people come here ready to deny everything... even when there's evidence 😭 sies 😱😁 @Lorna Kavanagh: because on paper the people were qualified for their positions but they were incompetent. Their way of addressing their incompetence was outsourcing. eskom chair. cant find a page number clap clap @Frank yup 👍 can you even count bwana Camera man 🤣😂🤣😂🤧🤧🤧 Raw and uncut

"This is the only Eskom Board that stopped load shedding. Not only that Always remembering that these crooks never ever thought they would have to explain thier crooked thieving so hardly covered thier tracks. Mike are you thinking of Anot Singh. He was at Transnet and then came over to Escom with Molefe. Investigations revealed that he never touched his salary paid into his account for 4 years. @Daniel Norman indeed he's my home boy frm Mahikeng but done his studies in the UK 
34:41,36:10, who is the guy always sitting behind the advocates. .....he must love being seen on tv....

Really🙄🙄 @Leon Mbangwa The idea was to maintian the equipment and balance that against little or no rolling blackouts. Sadly this bunch of thieves did nothing. So Dr Ngubane can easly use Eskom system yet its dificult to page a file😂😂😂 what a joke Shame poor Zondo Kagiso get well soon. me too 
38:33,39:37, This Ngubane Board and Molefe Administration ignored contracts that had made Eskom a cash cow for years. Thus all they have to pay for. me too no even me this guy love molefe shame thanks franky my bud So has Zuma been held accountable yet? There is a difference between personal and work email. Is he talking to techno fools or what? I wonder...What was the Company policy on using Eskom email address and not using company business communication on private email? "@Aimee Zuma must be forgiven 
39:52,42:48, Dr. Ngubane😂😂😂😂😂 "ba mo tshwere I don't understand this technical arrangement..hee banna Our mistakes do no involve billions of stolen money and ruin the economy. @mbuso you need help ASAP.!! Guide him like a child....He enjoyed the privilege of looting payback the money🙈🙈 "@Frank Jordaan Who are you representing ""our""?" but when it comes to steal you will understand technical 😁 We need a new political part

A very credible Witness this.... "@Kgotso Mpete Ms Klein gave us a ride too in the beginning @Ndumieh Mokoena Businessman Is a Man with a Business😂😂😂😂😂😂 @Mbuso😂😂😂😂 
49:02,54:32, morning everyone "Technical Staff i think Dr Ben started on wrong foot by trying to cover himself his answers make no sense This display of feigning ignorance is infuriating! Who is this businessman who cannot be named? African countries should stop putting people in positions due to title. Competency should be the primary factor in putting position of power. @Kgotso Mpete I doubt we'll be done with this character if he keeps doing this 😂🤣 @Samuel Skosana ZUMA "Ha Ha 
54:50,58:40, no one outside of Eskom should have input in the Media statement Mr Businessman is Zondo's youngest son. They are trying to protect him😁😁😁😁😂 businessman ...🤔 So Ms Daniels is the brain in his office And the blame game begins! "Such an intelligent man "Zuma "@Mbuso Ndlovu I really don't understand the of a pseudonym but chief @Mbuso 😂😂😂 
59:01,1:01:17, Ohh Ohh. Ms Daniela just rolled over by the bus and now he put the bus in reverse to Roll over her again. He was a lymdark leader as he relied mainly from CE.😂 @Fred Desrosiers the bus is going to hit many today😂😂 Peepow who is this Mr Tsotsi i thnik im left behind?? """Doctor Ngubane"" is a real Doctor or it is his name like ""Doctor Khumalo"" or Doctor Dre????????????????" He's trying to throw Zola Tsotsi under the bus Former Eskom board chairperson #Khuthele "@Khuthele Sompini ""As I seem to recall"" Mr. Tsotsi is the witness that testified today's ago 😂🤣" "He was given chairmanship to facilitate all the ""happenings and give the Guptas ........" 
1:01:31,1:03:52, Mubuso he has an academic doctoate The way I don't have patience for this dilly dallying! Where is that lady who questioned the fugitive? Blaming Ms Daniels @Eddie Reddy So why he look confused??? @Eddie Reddy Thanks for clarifying that because I couldn't imagine the doctor by profession stopping this low confused indeed Khutele. Mr Tstotsi was the previous chairman at Eskom who it's alleged was fired and This man put in his place due to connections with Guptas. so basically the Guptas got Tstotsi fired. Technical explanations were just too technical and complex for this doctor and board member. was he an independent or executive chairperson? 
1:04:25,1:06:07, "This commission should be held in Robbin Island "Mabusobecause the wrongs he did The more technical and full of jargon the quicker it would be approved "@Leon Mbangwa its how you steal the money EG Geof Makhubo madeR30m in a ""deal"" between him & Gupta company Regiments.He did nothing We hope in the future orange overalls will be in demand by correctional services "Why do we have high ranking board members of a high technology company who are not technically savvy? If they rely on others to make decisions "Bar myself is there anybody else in SA @Eddie Reddy Truth right there. It's not confusion per se. I don't understand why @Mbuso Ndlovu is unable to see that @Thobani Mkananda I just came to say hi and leave in peace. 
1:06:15,1:08:30, Mbuso:elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: "Men of integrity were in robben island 🤣🤣 "That is a load of c?+ "We just need a new political system in South Africa wait and see what comes from chair. What is this guy worth in rands? "Thobani  "Robben island is the leading island in the world 
1:08:42,1:12:09, "By the way Ms. Daniels was running the show!! "@Hlulani yup imagine if the same energy put into clicks was directed to the looting government.... that'd be great @Eddie Reddy 😂🤣 He must be too innocent and not have met enough of a lot of people with colours in the doctor's character. @Mbuso Ndlovu I now understand. Watch and learn 🤣 "Rob before millionaires from robben island Eddie not me It would be interesting if Malema was the one asking Questions here😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 "His excuse is @Rob Nel are you a former inmate at Robben island? 🤔 
1:12:27,1:14:18, "so the PA is communicating with many people in government outside Eskom and you are aware about it Thobani i have no mates If malema had t been kicked out of ANC he might also be sitting in the witness seat the relationship between the minister and the Eskom board is way beyond that of public concerns @Rob Nel 🤣😂 Copy that 🤣 @Dan Walmsley He must thank the ANC Rob you will never because right now you should be working why must second party have the final say "Eddie I am working 
1:14:18,1:17:27, """Chairperson guptas = no peace 💀 Rob then you re overpaid "Ngubane is a proud man. He doesn't seem to see anything wrong in what he did. The question still remains if you knew why didn't you do anything? What sort of leadership is this? So So you could give the board the biggest load of bull they would just approve it. "The whole idea of being employed is to earn as much as possible "indeed "Haha! Yibambe moo ka Zondo Canis if you are employed you EARN your money 
1:18:09,1:19:42, "Yibambe mfo kaZondo "LLl why work Miss Daniels should have been the CEO. She knew everything according to Ben. Uncle Ben knows how to drive people under the bus Did Zuma instruct the Minister to appoint Ngubane "We cannot all get tenders Ben Ngubane a whole Medico tjo he allowed himself to be used by Jacob Zuma nna ha ke utlwisise ka nnete Just like everything else in life he is proud and arrogant he does not see anything wrong 
1:20:08,1:24:29, Samuel the perception is that they got rid of Tsotshi to appoint their 'man'. Frank that's why dr Ben's personal business got liquidated. Karma Money is the root of all evil The LOVE OF MONEY is the root to all evil Eddy jip. I dont have respect for him anyway maybe he wanted full acceptance because before joining the ANC HE WAS AN INKATHA MEMBER The difference between Inkatha and ANC is in the uniforms they wear dr was prime minister of kzn when he was with Inkata Knowing he did not understand the technical details he should never have been allowed to remain. 
1:25:47,1:32:53, "Inkatha was a reactionary cultural organization A mere change of uniform then Sikobi correct "@Beverley Barrett technically he could give a stuff about ESKOM his job was to loot That board had no idea what was happening at Escom. They only had one objective and the smooth running of Escom did not feature. so they don't know who this businessman is or they rather not say? So my predecessor did it!!! the businessman is white 🤣🤣🤣 Ndumien it is clear that it was Essa. Pamensky also used the same email address to send secret Escom documents to. 
1:33:03,1:34:51, Please give us a name of this businessman Have I missed the issue of bags or brown envelopes. Maybe still coming yes levels of flippen plundering that wasn't the question sir!!! this PA was working for Essa and he is not aware!!! come on come on maan I like this counselor BN also has a coalmine.

White collar criminals the devil wears prada The inmates at Modderbee prison are looking for new Wifes So Mr Seleki was at Transnet but advising Ben on how to run Escom. The plot thickens. @Carmen James It's so possible hey because after lunch bombshells will start having names attached 🤣 Doctorate has been stripped off Mr Ngubane you can't communicate government issues using your personal email address.

They 'got a lift' with Minister of Defence. 
2:45:34,2:47:45, @Singi Mathebula They were trying to intimidate the sister country and pronounce the backing of SANDF at the talks "@Singi Mathebula no no no no kodwa mtaka ngubane wazhlanga niselani nezkhohlakali ze anc ukube wazhlalela ku ifp "and guess who is there Ma baker that is when he said that there was no payment to Tegeta. '@Abel Matshidiso What kind of BS is that 🤣😅 ":elbowcough:Dubai has cameras everywhere Always denying 
2:47:46,2:49:05, MRZondo hahaha As i understand the SANDF plane was used by defense Minister to go on ANC business not government business. just near lunch now I wonder who's sponsoring food "As much as I hate the ANC @ singi why didn't the ANC delegation use the Gupta helicopter to go to Zimbabwe. Eisj wonder if that DG ever slept?????

What more looting is there huh Please tell judge Zondo to take an antihistamine....ie ACTIFED OR SUDAFED to stop the sniffing @Frank Jordaan 🤣🤣🤣 @Russia Magezi my sympathy for him is exhausted by his involvement in governance long before h ed became president. He knew exactly what the state of affairs were. Arguably he was comfortable And now Mr Zwane's role being exposed. I remember when Zuma made fun in Parliament: A broken president.... 
2:51:05,2:52:38, Canis agree. "Cyril has been a senior member of the ANC while in exile Ja Ne "His tired "@Andrew Mboweni​ So true was CR in exile @OS Muzik . Cryil never went to exile No never president ramaphosa believe in academic research he never spent a night at alexandra and see for himself how hard life is rather than flying all over the globe claiming to be the leader that care 
2:52:48,2:54:39, thought so. While the ANC was in exile! "Thobani ANC chopped the legs of our future and say Vuk'uzenzele Agree "minister of correctional service nd justice These are all crooks Joe I remember that. Thanks for clarification - OS Muzik.. 
2:54:39,2:56:01, "we want the president who will welfare all of us private companies and government alike not to segregate and only look after government officials  ANC leaders defended Guptas and Watson with their dying breath!!!!! @Joe Lekalakala Sure Frank....! @Russia Magezi Perhaps it's because of my intolerance for all kinds of devils that I put him with everyone 😅🤣 Thabo Mbeki has a stint outside of SA and was once thrown into jail by Robert Mugabe in Harare They're all crooks. CR was in the top 6 that shared a table with Guptas at the ANC gala that Eskom sponsored. Corrupt. All of them. @Russia Magezi . It is Salim Essa "Yes Thanks Carmen

"@Samuel  Well said Thobani Definitely @Thobani Mkananda in Dubai Russia Salim Essa. Already mentioned by council and also confirmed by Escom employee Miss Daniels during her disciplinary hearing.
