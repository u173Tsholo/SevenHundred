time,7:58,message Greetings from #PaySlipBanSA is that the content Hall ? Memory loss is popular these days! following from Tz I think the whole country needs to appear to Zondo commission following from Tz he is there on project mdluli flow fr cptn 
8:17,22:53, lol @lindey @Paul Mutinda Habari za kwako ndungu bongo vipi hello leave the fishing out of this Paul...lol Naidu did not start his career in the Police he was employed by one of the persons implicated in this enquiry and then given rankings by the same person. I think the commission should close in on captured journalism Non of these Police Intelligence are qualified persons they were simply employed and promoted very quickly. @Gee Peex1 how are you today we havent engaged since friday hope you well 
25:05,29:22, "with credit crime* So should Malema be Investigated. The pot calling the kettle black. Hearsay evidence is admissable in law when it can be collaborated. What if criminals are sometimes released to commit crimes.... give ppl benefit of doubt. the country owes Malema a great deal regardless of party affiliation @Gee Peex1 Yes. Especially if I say that Tom advised that he committed a crime and Tom confirms that he did say so. It is no longer hearsay. No-one owes Malema anything play the ball before you play the man. this its why corruption thrives because the fight back is divided. think #zumamustgo March 
29:40,32:44, The Witness is picking his nose 40G yes chair they do "So is Ranjeni Munusammy a journalist or a secret service operative? Ditto Mzilikazi wa Afrika Zondo's humor is entertaining🤣🤣 Zondo is sharp R40.0 @Norman Zwane What has Karima Brown done now? R40.000.00 what hasn't she. she's basically a politician 
33:03,36:13, @Lex Luger Is she a journalist or an operative? is Karima involved guy's "hallo online analysts @Pastor J I am very well mfundisi. Sending you lots of brotherly love!!! @Lex Luger Same here my Precious friend don't impeed I read someone wrote about Mzilika waAfrika and Piet Rampedi here on the chat. are they also named? any way she was found to be partial by the courts Karima Ok heard enough from this witness. next! 
36:16,38:08, this is messy but they didn't mask his voice lol @redriger ...They only become admissible if the court exercises its power to admit hearsay evidence under Law of Evidence Amendment Act. sjo but these guys are skelm and corrupt @Lex Luger Oh maybe she's just been demonised by the EFF? This witness does not know a blank cheque "@redriger Hearsay evidence is not admissible in court unless a statue or rule provides otherwise. Therefore Witness is wasting g you can tell by her reporting 
38:16,41:15, *state resources "@redriger Generally he's contradicting himself now what if Zondo's name pops up? @redriger In my 1st message I did say that it is accepted only when confirmed as truthful evidence and collaborated "why is it so obvious that PP omits Ace from frede dairy @redriger You are right. anything is possible...Zondo is feeling the seriousness....it wont be business as usual in our SOE Conspiracy theory: 1 Witness is not being entirely truthful OR 2 Witness was coached and not given enough info. Where else would all the assumptions come from? 
41:16,45:36, her guests bring it up and she shifts topics lightspeed fast @ LEX Are the Hanekom attorneys related to the ANC Dirk Hanekom? right. but u get my point Gee? "@Brother Louis​ Mdluli's smile...he'll take all SOE down south with him... "lol read up @redriger The bulk of his evidence is based on facts and 1st hand information where he was present or involved. The hearsay is not being explored but further investigated as per DCJ @redriger The guy was just an unemployed relative more blunt than a butter knife. He don't know an assumption from a fact or a blank cheque. The guy was a dangerous fool that would become a snitch 
45:38,49:28, haha. I was cosigning someone. saying easy to see PP(BM) omit Ace from frede report but ppl don't notice certain journalist omit BOSASA donations and fake contracts "Gee Peex1 "@redriger Remember when he throws those bits of infoaround in the manner that he does I'm just so sorry the Red throw their weight behind this New PP @Bronx Wavy Give this fool a few more hours and I'm sure Mkhwebane's hairdo will come out as paid for by the spooks slush funds 😂😂 This witness' testimony will be taken with a pinch of salt. His credibility is doubtful. The only part of the Crime Intelligence moniker that is correct is the Crime bit. The Intelligence part is a misnomer. "Busisiwe: _""I'm doing my work""_" 
49:34,54:35, small nails hold a big coffin together @Crown Glass and Aluminium Thats a very intelligent comment. Thats exactly how I see and hear this evidence "a lot of smoke wits going on bois But will his evidence not be reduced to nothing with a thorough cross examination? Eskom burning pensions because they burnt their money long ago what happened to Maleka guys? "He has absolutely no concrete evidence. And the issues seem like fraud Can a leather jacket be gangsta 
55:16,57:21, 🤣 @Sean Johnson I hope so. I have a leather jacket "@Bronx Wavy @Brother Louis None what so ever - just TALL TALES he came with the fire I really want to know can a leather jacket be gangsta Norman agreed 101%. Many of these issues should have been raised/reported internally. Why wait so long... @Bronx Wavy Zondo's star witness crime intelligence went into real estate aswell 
58:12,1:00:14, @Sean see Pelle jacket$ @redriger Jeni was an open 'SECRET AGENT' They have houses in Clifton they had scams around sq footage If intelligence refers to mind state/capabilities....how is academia immune here....who processes these processes?...i'm writing an Epi.c @Brother Louis That is the reason he is in Witness Protection for 9 years. He started spilling the beans for 9 years now. People have been fired and criminal chards are pending Don't lose focus guys.The fact that some of his evidence is a hearsay does not necessarily mean it's not the truth. This is corruption by people who were supposed to fight corruption. lol its open now @redriger I'm on a popcorn binge myself 
1:00:34,1:03:41, the guy is sweating.... the 1 guy who seen a sentence "@Pastor J thank you for the info. This means that investigations were ""frozen"" and never pursued by any leader since. Quite shocking!" "@Brother Louis @redriger Dont be misunderstood. Witness Protection is possibly worse in many respects than Prison. rotten to the core . life goes on . and on . nothing done since . 11 s total disgrace @Brother Louis Thats correct. The crooks were protecting each other like blood brothers. "@Kay Kay @Gee Peex1 HOw the wheel turns 
1:03:46,1:07:55, "@Pastor J it's sad. This is common practice everywhere. ""Turning blind eye"" :(" hey everyone....errr wheres the video feed of this witness @redriger Dont forget to remember that Naidoo was unskilled and unemployed when Gen Lazarus employed him in CI has they are relatives. mmmh Big cars mmmh bmw 530 wow mmh Black Jeep im sure its a grand cherokee 530d such a nice car mhluli is not happy with every car he get aye bro i want Benz S600 
1:07:56,1:09:33, @Nicky Klue Offer us a guess Even Q7 is a beast on its own @redriger As a witness he is Mdluli's passport to a case where the state cannot prove its case. If I was Mdluli's attorney I'd be praying the guy is the state's chief witness. He'd tie himself up. "@Redriger @Thulani Bukani Hi brother. Nice to see you here on the chat again. I pray you are well guys write 2 camera to change camera guys write 2 camera to change camera guys write 2 camera to change camera guys write 2 camera to change camera 
1:09:35,1:10:46, guys write 2 camera to change camera guys write 2 camera to change camera guys write 2 camera to change camera guys write 2 camera to change camera why guys write 2 camera to change camera its called The party of bandits gum gum style I'm well @Pastor J hope you are well too @Thulani Bukani ....Do you know what ANC is? 
1:11:04,1:13:30, @Thulani Bukani Always my Brother the. Liberation Movement or the political party? This lady im sure she owns some land somewhere @redriger He was placed in WP by the SIU not CI. He may be safe for now African National Congress maybe? posing as the saviour of the masses from poverty. @Austin Van Rensburg I've run out of popcorn guys and this is boring. Cheers. see ya Norman @redriger Thats correct.Roelofse is not from CI @Thulani Bukani please also highlight that its the party that liberated you 
1:13:52,1:16:55, i want ace next Judge not well Not the same entity before and after 1994 the chair is bewitched icona not my chair @redriger I honestly dont know about him. I liked Chris Barnard though. hahahahahaha counterfeit teabags must be investigated. DCJ is sick @Gee Peex1 Have you ever committed a crime and what was it? No sound on my side😳😳😳 
1:17:58,1:21:30, Thanks @Gee Peex1 and then ate it? he bled to death internally Im live @redriger Every bit of intelligent evidence so far seems to indicate anything but a suicide. But....... @Thulani Bukani Yes but then they decided to enslave themselves again....then shift the blame...as you can see how they are currently implicated in all sorts of crimes and corruption acts. @Gee Peex1 Did Gavin Watson commit suicide or was murdered? he left it open for your interpretation @redriger That in itself creates every doubt about the suicide theory. But then again more sinister things have happened in this country. The question like who killed Hani comes to mind again 
1:22:08,1:25:09, @Gee Peex1 You just may be on the right track Pastor that's the one that needs to start the REAL clean sweep @redriger I am in total agreement with you @Bronx Wavy Absolutely right my friend churches are party to proxy funerals. shameful man did not die. sorry to say @redriger I have my thoughts. Hopefully we will see one of them BACK at the commission soon well @Austin Van Rensburg did black south Africans do that or was it ANC elites and associates? @Bronx Wavy You are indded right and justified to say what you did. I agree 
1:25:17,1:31:18, Normal everyday black business take a lot of blame for ANC messes @redriger Chris Hani would have very likely have become President after Mandela. Foloow the short trail from there @Thando Nkutha Welcome back my Dear Friend I don't wanna say who I believe was threatened by Hani "@Thulani Bukani Allow me to tell you that not everyone you see wearing a Black @Bronx Wavy Say it. Perhaps you are braver than me to start the conversation .they dont represent those who deployed them ey...even yourself...youre the only person who knows who you are. between The vision of a rainbow nation and Absolute ANC/intelligence & control .. can only be so many suspects Barroca burp 
1:31:20,1:34:16, @Gee Peex1 Blackie Swart was a Policeman in Security Branch @redriger That and an element of fear of being ecposed for what happened in the training camps etc @Gee Peex1 That was Whitey Basson I support the All Blacks @redriger and Zuma as President.......... rubbed out many tires following Mdluli hey shout me out homes "I'm not sure I follow @Austin Van Rensburg. if a person is dressed like ANC correct I was about to say the same @ Pastor 
1:34:45,1:37:04, i think we now understand why Batohi is not moving😪 corruption was like ebola in the JCPS cluster. @Gee Peex1 No problem. Today I will be your instant encyclopaedia @Thulani Bukani i want you to look at it deeper than that.... hahahahaha bruh Batohi needs a Batman signal to begin her work. @Austin Van Rensburg you're gonna have to tell me what im missing my guy. Go read what the ANC is Pastor J are you real pastor or a journalist? Batohi stepped into her role on the ticket of speedy high-profile prosecutions.. so far I count zero 
1:38:42,1:42:32, @Yolo More I am a recently Retired Pastor. A real one wna Naidoo you are a puppet nxa if there isn't enough evidence to close the book on Esidemeni then who exactly is going to jail for anything else? @Yolo More . That was a pecular question? "a Zuma literally got away with murder because although he was speeding in the rain "nobody  @Singi Mathebula. hahahahahahaha @redriger Yes. NPA is Lion with no teeth or claws 
1:43:08,1:47:11, "This investigation can potentially go on forever and cause the downfall of many public officials. ""State Capture"" seems like a lazy way of describing all the corruption by willing participants." @redriger Yes and I wondered what was the trigger @Austin then we are saying the same thing. Black south Africans didn't do this. it was greed from ANC guys and their friends. what's there to look deeper into? @Yin Yang Brilliant my friend Pastor J I expected only John3:16 from you😋😋but you are well informed about anything. You are so knowledgeable. @Yolo More . Thank you kindly my Precious friend. I am just a simple person who reads a lot with many years of life experience. thank you for your kind words Pastor J an encyclopedia indeed🙏🙏 @redriger . Probably. The man who knows most is one Tokyo Sexwale. He knows a lot lot more @redriger That was a convenient convenience. Financially and otherwise 
1:47:36,1:51:43, @redriger ??? Irony of this Commission that has costed us over R350m so far is that all of it is known already to the Hawks. Where is the NPA in all of this ??!! "The chairperson must ask for 40k from CI so that the Dr can come to the commission and consult with him "@redriger Dont forget that Tokyo""s wife Judy was very very handsomely rewarded in the divorce settlement" "Most of the ""connections"" come from pro-democracy days. Same players." The article on Daily Maverick by Pierre de Vos very interesting. Won’t hold my breath for prosecutions after reading that 😢 *pre- @Heather Cotton Spot on. She knew tooo much pastor J does smoke the gun indeed. 
1:52:12,1:58:18, Are they finishing later today? @Singi Mathebula Absolutely right 8 years on full salary in witness protection !!!!! and so we listen to others bad doings but forget the tree in our own eye we must forgive those who sinned against us so that we can do the same @redriger There was many and still are many honest ones out there. But they are suppressed. The fact os that if honest Prosecution took place now we will not have much of a Govt left to rule. 8 Years in witness protection on full salary !!!!! But the advocate is not bad at all. Witness testimony feels a bit MIA co governance is the only effective 
1:58:56,2:01:33, @redriger At some stage soon.very soon.there will be a major upheavel. Hopefully I pray it will be peaceful. People are deeply frustrated Gee 😊😊😊😋😋 Feels like we already have covert co-governance 🤣 Shame he is tired we can hear you @Gee Peex1 Follow the trail.The Seriti Commission report and findings which was favorable to certain parties was recently set aside by the High Court. Zondo said yesterday that prosecutions should already be happening Abo mamgobhozi these ones "crime intelegence crime in crooks crooks getting paid by us to steal from us crime intelegence lining their pockets and eat whole curried chicken and bunnuchows 
2:01:52,2:03:25, Batohi is on working holiday "Who here still reads the Sapafiles? Some nice info on SA history scratching speakers my audio too Gee Peex1 the witness asked for a break one off their cords there..... all audios Gee feedback @redriger This beautiful country and its wonderful mix of people will overcome and be successful and respected very soon 
2:03:46,2:09:01, Yeah about that pastor "imagine the reason for not 1 prosecutuon radio 2000FM NOW CRIME FM 02 CRIME FM 03 LISTEN TO IT DAILY SAME TIME and get a mercedes for free "but they took Agrizzi and them to court @redriger South Africans must always be Patriotic and never cease to be believers. We have the Foundations of a beautiful country and the most wonderful people in it. Why not NPA the public's only weapon made futile yes why not we are one people with the same blood samw worries same ilnesses and same joyes "Been One people I almost laughed when I seen the Hawks swoop down on Agrizzi. I wondered if they got lost trying to find their way to ANC people 
2:09:09,2:12:17, "Pastor J "@Danie Nilsen Yes you right Danie. But we must deal with some big issues. Crime were there any honest people in the crime and intelegence multiculturalism needs multiple holidays. @Naledzani Mashau Each of us have a choice. If we can find our way to the Polling booths the we are given the gift of thought and decisions as well. You are right Advocate Sello is scarce too many Lazy ANC loyalists still clinging to old age dominating the majority at the polls "Sorry @Pastor J agreed one isue i have is the beee and land qeustion it is a worry some issue that can put this country on fire my believe all can have their own property with title and not be a shackdweler 
2:12:30,2:15:54, it's now 16.15hrs "SA @Thando Nkutha Personally I have always been poor and still am. That is my entire motivation in life. To serve amongst the most downtrodden. I have never ever earned a single penny in Ministry.Truth "Thando "I would like my minority @Danie Nilsen Absolutely right my friend. Every South African irrespective of race etc should ultimately own a piece of property. Thats an Ideal which can be achieved if we chose to all work together Are we done for the day or what? Yes self sufficient living residents is the government's worst nightmare. The Land issue will sit on ANC desk forever 
2:16:21,2:19:58, @Thando Nkutha I believed and still do of the Giving rather than the Receiving Philosophy. I am poor but blessed and happy smoke and mrrors @redriger i agree the country haves and have nots must work out how to support each other with out waiting for a hand out the recipient does not want that they want to work for what they want land and economy is a narrative being peddled. you can do fine with got family sustaining yourself or your community To be here? All rise👥👥👥👥 10h00 tomorrow 9.45 tomorrow As we close may I wish you all a blessed and safe evening🙏🙏🙏 👍
