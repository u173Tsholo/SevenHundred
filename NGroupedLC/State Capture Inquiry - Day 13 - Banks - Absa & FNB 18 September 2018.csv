43:25,45:53, "tjo uyababa losisi evidence leader/interrogator...she's destructing me with her beauty well we have to nadmit and take cognisancde o the fact that there was evidence but zuma had effectively blocked all institutions from investigating "@Christian W pleasure "sorry mzi keep your masander in yor pants @Christian W let's have a rational discussion stop being emotional this was not an administrative matter hence paja does not apply 
46:08,48:46, Wow she is gorgous! but the cancellation was an admin matter @Kercy Pillay "@Christian W Is it untoward for the ruling party to engage company involve in massive retrenchment at the party head office? ndumiso it was not for the purposes of paja i think that was made clear yesterday the bank has to comply with the banking act Pretty counsel is wasting time asking questions to which the answers were already given.... are we now sympathising with guptas Mosebenze Zwane and that voice of stealing is all over illegal things

If they do another I'm certain it would reverse @sizwe gwala and @sibonga stop the tribal fights What tribal fight? This guy is a fool stop. @Leb M I read that the economy is struggling so we might have to buy uk as Saffas @Kercy Pillay after reading my Admin law notes i am forced to disagree with you with regard to whether the cancellation falls under Section 33 of the Constitution or not Hand! @fils de l'homme the economy should be fine but it is likely to fall hard if they aren't able to negotiate a full deal with E.U when leave is initiated in March 2019 because they can't negotiate new 
1:10:49,1:14:43, ... deals until they have left E.U am together **all together @Leb M what is the relationship like btwn whites and black Saffas in UK?
