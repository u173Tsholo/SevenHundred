time,13:26,message c No matter SABC sold some of its content for so cheap. the commission must look into Hlaudi with that regards as well. incompetence I bought his book last year and read it.😌😃 "@ThandoAM Xaba  "Indentured cool ThandoAM Xaba can you send it to me I need to read that book 📖 
13:54,24:39, Hlaudi "I don't have an eBook This is a bloody disgrace when is the big tsotsi/Zuma coming ThandoAM Xaba I’ll be visiting the book shop Cool. SABC is outdated and run by dinosaurs who are stuck in the stone-age methods of doing business. can they also talk about the selling of government and state owned enterprise jobs. from transnet to governement departments zumaristo 
25:22,30:31, nor wonder sabc is in this mess when is zuma coming here Zuma put Hlhaudi in charge of the SABC for a reason @Magda Seguin Zuma put all his foot soldiers in charge for a reason. I know Zondo should start targeting the Zuma foot soldiers "Tge Gioras are SA citizens now Zuma was so hellbent in taking this country to the clearner Sorry for the typos....**the Guptas 
31:19,33:56, *India don't want the Guptas back there keep on mentioning zume here..... he knows where we live 😂😂😂😂😂 "SABC wenzeni uZuma I'm not scared of Carl Niehaus in his PEP camouflage uniform😂 Welcome to RSA disappointment is our daily bread. Pep sells camo ? Madam evidence leader is competent and confident and smart "Soooooooo 
34:03,39:56, You can even get camouflage at Guess stores then stupid people supporting a thief Zuma in his currupt cases after all this Adv Norman seats in the Judicial Service Commission "Rajesh Sundaram has bad teeth for a millionaire @Thando Nkutha he is indeed a man with principle. He has hypertension too that might not be the only he know let's dig more. cases after cases yu Zuma Gigaba 
40:22,44:23, ya gigaba hii hiiii "There should be mass incarceration like what happened in Brazil of these politicians @Rushay Booysen And the fools still voted for them. yeah where are the gubtas now are they watching this "We can't blame the Guptas when we got such gullible leaders for those hu dont know Gigaba i will be sending his vid very soon Zuma still not arrested? this man deserve a huge punishment. 
45:05,50:50, masibulele masbu you basted @Thando Nkutha yup Taxman guns for Bosasa boss Gavin Watson (News24) Gigaba why is gigaba not arrested by now Zuma "@Thando Nkutha it also shows you the greed The Guptas had no love for South Africa Best quote from Zuma “I can’t go to the inauguration I’m busy trying to stay out of jail” 
51:23,59:27, @Solly 12 😂😂😂 best one indeed COPE question in parliament these people are still conducting business in south Africa.. mxm please refer to Zuma as NO.9 for this hearing if it was at Rwanda all this people will b in jail .a democratic state like south Africa having to deal with lawlessness SAA ceo resigned because he has received no support and was indermined by managers. So it seems like the bad people are still in SAA. SAA is in such a bad way.... like Eskom Kanti what happened so far to the suspended secretary of this zondo commission? Just tuned in.....is the Judge ok today? 
1:01:49,1:05:53, South Africa has an independent judiciary that will not allow people to be jailed without following proper processes How can you be undermined by you junior and complain about it and not do anything about it Thando may be the streets are right has Pravin issued statement concerning these resignations yet? That is what the CEO said ... "@Thando Nkutha Sad if that is true! But @thando nkutha may be u can school me with process becos the guptas are gone & they told us that we are screwed becos they won't come back cos they don't trust the law which was easily broken by them "@Mzalwane Mzala thats very true That CEO is not being fair to black professionals. He cant just quit and blame everyone. So how long will this commssion go on for unit some1 gtes arrested 
1:06:13,1:10:07, until someone gets arrested* @carnoth ngomane Without an independent judiciary you become a proper banana republic duduzane is living large with our money in Dubai the same money which he could have invested in a country where he stole it from .Dubai is developing through our money No arrests because our law enforcement agencies are in bad shape as destroyed by zuma crap Without an independent judiciary all the cases that the DA and the EFF won against government and parliament would not have been possible. Payments were being made in Cash - lol @Thando Nkutha Is it a matter of his management style - being strict? Is this what the streets are saying? Without an independent judiciary the constitutional court would not have ruled that reports of the public protector and binding "@Mzalwane Mzala true that but our judiciary has led us to where we are now 
1:10:24,1:15:24, Without an independent judiciary former president Zuma would not have paid anything towards the Nkandla costs @carnoth ngomane Who are those individuals and what did they do? @Mzalwane Mzala Agree - we have a world class judiciary. There will always be a couple of bad apples in any large organisation. @Mzalwane Mzala if you were following this commission you should know by now that our judiciary was also captured @carnoth ngomane I have been following it. I hope you know that the NPA is not part of the judiciary "Gordhan was in charge of the treasury when some of the bad things like Arms Deal "Please somebody True!! "This fella keeps digging himself into a grave with his statements 
1:16:12,1:17:20, That's cheating skipping pages..... Judge @Zikhona Zondani not sure what you mean by digging his grave cos he is very credible there no graves to dig but the Guptas and Zuma's "his testimony has a lot of red flags what a great witness let the truth be told "There are others who will attest to what he is saying Facts are did meetings 4 of them with zuma happened @carnoth ngomane The judiciary proved to be the light in the dark days of a captured government right magda I wish I had some electronic device where I can just push a button and blow up the idiot posting the spam whole network....Grrrrr 
1:18:02,1:19:33, @Mzalwane Mzala but after how long? Will the Christian ATM keep Manyi when all his misdemeanors are exposed? Mr Pretorius No on duty today??...No tie how did he know so much as this was submitted by 2013 to 2014 before all the noise was made about zuma @carnoth ngomane I forgive you for thinking that the judiciary includes the prosecutors The lead advocate is brilliant @Cerebis My conspiracy theory - JZ's friends have paid spammers and set up bots to try and distract us from hearing what's going on. I think he is a joiner He found the organisation on its way 
1:19:40,1:42:53, UN headquarter will just be demolished will all the dignitaries inside this advacate is doing an rxcellent job "He had to submit an affadavit as a witness this guy is a liar roght magda "Some people call brave whistleblowers liars..go figure Paid trolls and bots Is it tea time already? just arrived ? 
1:43:07,1:54:02, then now p82 Naidif what is all this you are posting why? @Yvonne Morudu They are paid spammers. Click on the name and 3 dots will come up. Click on Report or Block. @goolamv Done thanks have blocked this stupid general responsible for waterkloof became ambassador @goolamv 😂 I saw in Twitter that Zuma was asked by the commission to come and testify in July but his lawyers wrote a complicated denial....same Stalingrad tactics we are used to @Anne M. True I also saw it through the media. No one was removed 
1:54:36,1:58:09, @Magda Seguin No surprise there. Same modis operandi we've seen for years. that is zuma and his chessboard Chris Zondo is being bit naive he must be knowing that no one was held responsible for Waterkloof saga "The Zuma acolytes are busy on Twitter asking whatabout Gordhan @Nelson Musoliwa . I AGREE The country is in the brink of bankruptcy yet they still defend the Chief Thief up to 90 percent of the population is naive. citizens ✊🏿 Zuma Do we still believe that the commission is a fruitful exercise...? 
1:58:34,2:01:31, Some are so stupid to think that SOMANY people just made up stories to implicT implicate Zuma right magda 🤗🤗Is it not possible to refer all these cases to Corruption Unit that must be established in each high court? SA high courts needs Corruption units that must deal with all those cases. If one reads and listens to their nonsense I swear they think it is a huge conspiracy "Listen to the NPA press conference with Batohi and Cronje here on YT @Zolisa Memani . Maybe that's why Maposa launched a unit called Scorpion under the NPA there has been a lot of corruption and I'm afraid we won't get all the criminals i would have given same notice as i would have been scared for my life well done to this witness 
2:01:41,2:03:01, Yes exactly..the NDPP explained everything @Zolisa Memani Courts do not investigate. They adjudicate @sipho cebo I share your concern. As long as they go for the big fish and not the little fish. wow he was so brave Ex minister Jeff Radebe and his interministerial task team will now have some explaining to do about the Waterkloof landing. Ms Batohi said that the corruption in SA is of endemic proportions nobody was thwre to help me @Zolisa Memani The Special Investigative Unit (SIU) has been empowered to deal with corruption Sipho cebo all we need is someone who is going to start singing from inside the ANC 
2:03:51,2:09:18, @Anne M Tge NDPP said they are busy with the biggest and most I.portant cases first.Remember they are also getting rid of the bad apples "Please listen to the YT video of her press conference I listened to it live Zuma sold his own country @Solly 12...so many within parliament already did..just go back on YT to see the testimony of the ex SCOPA chair @MARUMO SEGOPOTSO MABALANE ...Zuptoid sold OUR country...His is nKandla Every whistleblower who testified told about the victimization and toxic work environment I believe Sundarum.👀🤷‍♀️ Sundaram is getting fed up 
2:09:27,2:16:00, Magda Saguin I what u mean but I feel like there’s a lot of information we are not getting here It's terrible being made out to be a liar They must show their faces at the commission and stop writing affadavits to be read "Thank you Sir They will say the cameras did not work...baskets "@lemmy mohale An innocent person would be at the commission demanding to be heard They KNEW they were coming...jirre this is disgusting "I think forthwith nobody would want to whistleblower "@AnneM 
2:17:31,2:23:50, "Agrizzi was robbed and attacked at a garage last week whose statement is the advocate reading "@Magda Seguin I also think the whole Agrizzi hold up at the service station is iffy. A question that came to mind was I am surprised at Judge Zondo's attitude towards the witness The English on this thread is horrible. "I think the quotes which should have been ""my understanding"" yesterday caused some concern. I think Judge Zondo's listened more today." @Takalani Luthada Moegsien Williams This witness stood his ground in spite of the necessary interrogation by Justice Zondo. He didn't waver at all. Was prepared to be cross examined. The Justice has a duty to clarify uncertainties. is this a man?😅😅😅
