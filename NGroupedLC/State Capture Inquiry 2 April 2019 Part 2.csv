38:22,41:06, @welton paulse.. I totally agree @Tich Ziny she is a junior "@Abel Manyedi the defence land stole fearfokkols glasses or she leaned him a pair. just saying. lady @Spider she appears to be junior is that Gin in the bottle in front of witness still is @welton paulse NO - vodka 
41:32,43:50, "@welton paulse  @Cameron Kim the smell of that vodka is getting to the witness @welton paulse..they will soon finish all alphabets paraglaphs @welton paulse sadly I have to fully agree with you Did this lady really handle the Bosassa Case ?

At least the adv is doing fine up to now. "BLF and Zuma cooking something "I was away for a few minutes @Desmond Masilela - think her nerv has calm 
46:43,49:16, "@makhosi nobhatyi Zuma is an old dog  @Madelein Huxtable. She's getting there slowly but surely @Magda Seguin She was asked to read an e-mail sent to her about the Bosasa matter This looks like a badly scripted high school play Maryke...ja neh Thanks @Anne M "@ Cameron kim his time is here Zuma now posting pictures of him in swimming pool "@makhosi nobhatyi it is too late to sort him out 
50:35,52:01, "Mbeki was not handled by Zuma. It was Mantashe @welton paulse Correction - the fire pool @welton paulse is Gavin Watson with him in the pool @welton paulse . Swimming pool that was meant for Fire fighter. @Anne M. i think his head was on fire "@Thami Ngwenya yes  @Cameron Kim Watson is now doing Nkandla maintenance all those incriminated or suspected of fraud or corruption should be suspended without pay until proven innocent in a court of law. @welton paulse that must be a 500 000 million contract

1:01:49,1:03:23, this is boring He's being pedantic. .. but I get her reasoning. That is when you do your bosses work and neglect your own work Cameron so they not African he iis a brilliant man thank goodness he is heading this commission 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴 This work is boring. but it is the details that count in the end. and that is what wins and loose cases. chair wants to go for a break again @Raymond Fitzgerald Agree 
1:03:24,1:04:42, and we wonder why the npa can not get any convictions it follows the subject matter....

1:30:57,1:32:20, Zondo roaring like a lion The judge seems tired...Im not surprised @Quintin Jacobs not really - the DA will loose many votes and the EFf will gain many votes sShe's simply laying the foundation. Boring but necessary. He must be careful of burnout..Mr Pretorious as well The paperwork in this Commission is never up to date it seems. "@Magda Seguin  @L L is she your girlfriend ? Sounds like taht WHO GETS THESE CLOWNS IN 
1:32:32,1:34:27, "@Magda Seguin I only had half an eye on the Mokgoro inquiry @welton paulse Can you blame Zondo when a witness is unprepared ? @L L you are right...doctors spend less than 15 min. with a patient...nurses are there round the clock...up to 12 hours at a time @L L this is the worst witness and totally unprepared "Very true Cameron Kim @Cameron Kim not at all i wouldve given the technicians a hint ages ago to mess up the sound or something Where was the chair sleeping? VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL @Simlindile Kibido Now we must go back and assist the chair to catch up. 
1:34:40,1:35:42, @Desmond Masilela Zondo is a man of strength and nothing slips him . Must be very difficult for him today with this pathetic witness @Cameron Kim that would be a win DA losing votes "@Anne M *Jiba @Cameron Kim. 😂😂 Wow they are wasting time ne?? Only people who came before commission seemingly prepared were Mr Jonas and Agrizzi @Quintin Jacobs I do not care about votes - all is bulshit @welton paulse the weekend us still far away 
1:36:10,1:37:18, @Magda Seguin zonda going to call in sick tomorrow This woman is very unprepared and she is confusing the chair now "Mr Ramathlodi was an excellent witness @Frik Brits the witness is pathetic and her documents not making sence they must send this pre school teache to do her homework and come back again "@Yibanathi Nkosana the chair is seeing everything "@Cameron Kim  @Cameron Kim in the WC the have and the have not is to painful so yes DA must beg to stay in power @Magda Seguin. How do you rate Agrizzi? 
1:37:33,1:38:52, We not going anywhere @Quintin Jacobs at least the roads in the WC is not all full of holes like ANC provinces 100% Aggrizzi this StateCapture Com is captured to date Parrafin is not willing to be cross examined "Agrizzi  "This is so boring Just an endless confusion about what is where ....... Who caused this confusion ??? "As a senior prosecutor she should have had her own PA "@seguin 
1:39:17,1:41:23, This must be a joke. #DisorganisedWitness @Cameron Kim potholes = trucking here in the WC not lotsa industries ie mining just drink some of the wine in bottle already going nowhere slowly @Albert Noah I can see that Mr Agrizzi is sincere hence he is not scared to die.I believe he gave all the evidence he has where iz Agrizzi this lady iz confused Judge wants a Pee If Agrizzi goes to prison he will probably die there "@Quintin Jacobs NO  
1:41:27,1:42:28, he will go wash his face to wake up a little. wow the adv can guide me "If I was Judge Zondo  witness goinng to run away now @Quintin Jacobs Pothole = NO maintenance on the road build in apartheid time "@wild I assume comfort break is toilet break in legal or commission terms The DA at-least are doing that and stealing less money - so true yes BUT spending money in affluent areas ha ha

1:45:50,1:48:33, @Zamo Ngobese if you are black you are privileged since 1994 "@Zamo Ngobese you got a computer or a smart phone @Cameron kim why are you so negative towards women shame it's very ugly all it does just exposes your very poor self image depends what you call a privileged kid "@seguin There have been such a lot of race bashing on this thread I thought some should be educated that not all whites agreed with apartheid "@Thembisa Odendaal I am not negative  "@Zamo Ngobese I am previously and a current disadvantage . I am no beggar though and demand nothing for government except a clean and non corrupt government "@seguin 
1:49:27,1:52:13, I was born dumb so not sure that classified me as privileged. but over time I learnt to use maths and work out 1+1=2 and if you try turn one of the 1s into a 5 you are cheating and go to jail. @peter pott every single tribe in SA is racists and SA politics are racist . Anyone who identifies themselves primarily by race is a racist. Without the whites ( and sometimes the Indiers) the EFF and ANC will not be big parties. "@Kim @Peter pott...you should see the English with their racist comments which are far far worse on the Brexit threads I watch on euronews oh crap i fell asleeo is it over for the dsy? @peter pott we have still those laws just a different color @peter pott eg Traditional law and Constitutional Law.

Agreed! true Ann Anne Shamila Batohi’s silence is getting louder & louder I was wondering why Batohi is focusing on The KZN killings instead of Bosasa 
2:23:27,2:25:12, Snake and Snail are finished once this lady is done. Zonda will order them out of the other commission does not. they had all this data and did nothing.

Yes in Mats we have the highest - higher than white people @ any given time lawyers deal with mega amounts of pages I have the greatest of respect for them ...endless reading I would have loved to be a lawyer love the argument and case law but can't deal isn't BANTU derogatory?referring t us as blacks 🤗🤗 "@Abel Manyedi it is not derogatory Snake shot. bang gone failed in her tasks "I think she is hungry I switched phones and the first thing that popped up is her face...She says the ANC will not select people to be subjected to scrutiny 
2:29:33,2:32:48, "@seguin Bantu refers to African people’s that came from the mid & central Africa @Solly 12 and northeren sub sahara philani you are disrespectful & disgusting in your comments about women. why dont you watch days of our lives or some other soapies instead. as it appears you are an idiot so what was BANTU education than @Abel Manyedi education for the banto tribes And there she names them all. Nice. Hope she includes the ANC skelms. @Abel Manyedi it has a negative connottation in S.A however the name bantu is just a way of saying caucasian for white ppl Cameron Kim are you related to Kim Kardashian

"@friks @L L this women cant get to the point "If Agrizzi’s testimony does help to fix our country Just want to say I know Agrizzi is s great skelm & this was a personal vendetta against Watson nevertheless he managed to take us into his confidence he deserves mercy from all of us I am in Russia now - Veronezh for the next 4-6 months 
2:39:33,2:44:20, Another hero we were not aware of....honest and diligent "@Madlala "@Cameron Kim that is cool @Magda Seguin ...agreed.... hard to believe that there are actually any honest people working in the ANC Government.... it's the borderline that went to the next page "@seguin "Thembisa Odendaal I think he should be given another chance "same goes to SARS. pick a men she could be the NPA head. and teach others. with what she knows 
2:45:12,2:52:11, VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL apparently because the ANC saved south Africa from apartheid they all became entitled into taken(corruption) at the own will if they wanted to.. "@wild @Enrico Abrahams VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL i believe Agrizzi could be remorseful & rehabilitated but they must strip them of all the money from criminal means @Robert Russell the ANC corruption runs very deep rightcdown to branches and municipalities... somevof the VBS money came from illegal investments by municipalities Zonda is a smart man. Oh I think we all know that.... hence the only way to get ourselves out of this corrupt mess is to vote the ANC out on the 8th.... even that might not be enough for the first 5 year term I'm afraid so much will need to change. 
2:53:23,2:57:19, We need a clearly articulated solution with a road-map of what is to be done when and what the outcome should be. "No Judge ANC out. new government will need to ask people to change there attitude towards tourists and welcome them in with open arms. fastest way to get money into the system. new border controls in place. Mr Agrizzi said he got the documents from Dudu Myeni at a specified hotel There are thousands of jobs waiting if correct action is taken but no quick fix is possible. it will take time. lots of court cases to be held. We can set up a concerned citizens interim government a big leek in the NPA. What position does Dudu Myeni hold? "General population has lost hope and there isn't a vision of what we can work towards. With a background like that 
2:57:28,3:01:22, There are great civil society NGOs that have great minds and true patriotism We know Jiba was involved yes Dudu at the hotel and Agrizi took the pics in the passageway guyz we are in major trouble if we end up with dd mabuza there's no alternative "Mabuza is already preparing himself Mabuza owe Putin Millions "We know who must be voted out Only option is DA @magda I can still deal with the arrogance but but ignorance I cannot deal with 
3:01:46,3:04:19, Top I am voting the ANC out any one except the EFF and the BLF clowns.... that Cyril is something else DA in power will be even worse than ANC. At least ANC has its policies but DA has none except to say that they will do it better. They won't exist I think the only option is Cope .The DA is arrogant .Lacota was the only Leader who are willing to stand for ALL South Africans "Yes Russia assisted the ANC terrorists @Netsport Talent Register ...100% agree with you 
3:04:30,3:06:57, I do feel sorry for people who suffered 25 years ago. and then under the last 15 years under the last ANC leaders and now scared to vote in DA because the fears ANC and have instilled. no way back Lekota is pals with Steve Hofmeyer..I don't trust his friendship with rightwingers I live in Cape Town @Magda Seguin. The DA's success is not a result of their own policies but is more due to the actual citizens who are very active and very upset by what DA is now doing. Same as a school which only accepts top qualifying students and claims they teach better than other schools. I am very impressed with the DA in Gauteng...they turned around billions of debt in the past few years and rooted out corruption We need to spread power to the small moderate parties like COPE and ACDP. next witness is Mr Dukwana when they back. Friday Vote for Cope at your peril...all I'm saying
