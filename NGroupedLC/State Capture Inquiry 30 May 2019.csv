time,24:53,message Morning last night I didn't sleep well thinking about this crooked Brain molefe selling out the country hello Brian Molefe should be charged with treason !! Molweni HALLO Brian Molefe was one of the ANC's blue-eyed boys. Blame the ANC for his destruction. We need lifestyle audit to all this institutions 
27:35,35:58, Especially municipalities and get rid of districts municipalities molefe and his band of train robbers "The new cabinet does not inspire confidence in the much-heralded ""New Dawn"". Ramaphosa has failed his first test. Seems like more of the same from the ANC." Wow hey hey this bursted molefe I thought we were hear to talk about molefe and transnet not Cyril and what you think he did wrong. ðŸ¤” tell them zikhona bayabora @Zikhona Zondani You try and stop me. SABC are you going to stream the cricket? 
36:03,40:25, "How does he fail before action @Thami Ngwenya Definitely not David Mahlobo! He's a crook. As for Thulas Nxesi - he tried to sell us the 'fire-pool' story yazi abo purple cows Angie Motshekga is useless - look at our education system that she has been in charge of for years now. Blade Nzimande - useless. The caviar communist. @SABC Digital News Please show the slides!! "People in township might disagree with you Gwede Mantashe - Bosasa beneficiary - crook. All communities fighting mining companies must be nervous. Gwede certainly won't protect them. 
41:21,44:25, "I also dont get the blade nzimande appointment but SACP would have been making noise right now so to please our alliances Angie!!! ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜• Maite Nkoana-Mashabane - useless - she gave Grace Mugabe diplomatic immunity illegally and allowed Bashir to escape the law. But Derek can you give other people a chance even though things never gone your way. SA have many challenges to deal with Fikile Mbulula - a Guptoid - crook. @Thami Ngwenya I have little choice - all I'm saying is that it's more of the same from the ANC. "Can the heaven please open up and give us ""saints"" since everyone on the planet is a ""crook""ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚" @Zikhona Zondani Don't bother looking at the ANC then. SABC why canâ€™t we see screen shots today? Too early? 
44:26,47:55, Same players but different coach and tactic. HOPE YOU FOLLOW SPORT "@Thami Ngwenya so true. complaining and throwing of toys is not going to help. Fikile @Thami Ngwenya Aaah - the Ramaphoria argument. You're just fooling yourself. Derek should take his views to twitter.ðŸ˜‚ hel be more successful there. Sent Gabriel then @Zikhona Zondani Have you got anything worthwhile to say? Ramaphosa has failed his first big test. What test ðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ•º 
48:06,54:52, which test bafoo @Thami Ngwenya can we please not entertain trolls please ðŸ˜• Selecting a cabinet we can trust to rescue SA from the brink. And significantly reducing a seriously bloated and expensive cabinet. Whos this bubbly man :O does anyone know when this testifying will come to an end. these people have resigned 2 years ago Molefe has probably moved to dubai ðŸ˜‚ "zikhona zondani it's still got a long way to go in our country we judge according to the line-up not the performance give ramaphosa time and then you will judge after "caught up late guys 
55:04,1:05:31, @Khalid Mather Thobani Mnyandu "@Minoctar Sithole The problem is "@Noluthando Masondo Thanks sisi  Solar chargers for salesmen "Shame man Mobile phone solar chargers for sales No electricity regarding "@Khalid Mather He's a director at MNS attorneys and he was lead attorney into the investigating of relocation of the OEM""S" @SABC Digital News AT LAST!!! 
1:05:46,1:20:43, One sensible comment the EFF make is that CR has not reduced a bloated cabinet he has appointed more Deputy Ministers that means his cabinet has 34 members and not 28. can someone please rescue us from Jordaii please "@Lucy Lucy @Jordial.. is this a movie you recommend we watch? Aa! The Afro 4000 trains worth R600 million were unsuitable for local conditions.. they were too high. @Jordaii. Is this a virus? The diesel locomotives supplied by NCRS had major alternator problems. Boring 
1:24:04,1:51:46, Go Proteas Protea power! In short this was a tender to procure Locomotives and trains with a total of R2. 65 billion but exceeded this amount by more than R1. 2 billion. How many locomotives were delivered to date? haha @ Jacob Zuma you will have to sell your expensive hats and shirts but I am certain it will be Nkandla soon. I think 18 locomotives are waiting to be delivered at a harbour in China. Remember they are assembled here. Of the 1 064 original order? This was a R600 million contract that went up by R69 million @Kevin. Yes 
1:54:09,2:07:45, @Thando Nkutha I agree - I think he's failed his first test. To date 185 locomotives "I thought this came from PP and was adopted by parliament. What the President to do with law enforcement "Cameraman  R50bln was split between 4 global railway groups but infect this entire project far exceeded this amount. The entire cost was likely to be R134 billion "what's happening is outrageous! and the ""new dawn"" is one of the biggest farce I've seen!" "The ""NewDawn of Corruption ""." "Thando you will never be satisfied 
2:08:32,2:18:52, 1.4 trillion rand got stolen over the last 4 years in this great country. That's more than one year's tax collection! You must take into account the years that Zuma was deputy President and President don't forget how wealthy you have to be to belong to the G20. "Like I said before OEM is original equipment manufacturer? KKK probably would argue they are dealing with racial prejudice. ..just not the way we expect. "They did not do their homework IE. locomotives not compatible with our tracks @Kevin Allister Simon The same could be said of the ANC and corruption. 
2:20:58,2:26:05, other parties must win elections that's all I thought OEMs were the Transnet mechanical Engineers responsible for the assembly of these trains? @sipho cebo Or be ruled by thieves. Is this the best the ANC has to offer? "@Derek Main just win elections OEM = Original Equipment Manufacturer "Sister on the left is so over all of this lol @sipho cebo I agree that is the solution but unfortunately we have fools for voters. sister to the left is unprofessional hola 
2:26:25,2:39:15, "@Lucy Lucy actually you're right Some things just have to be said. Total predicted cost R134 billion Iwish I had owned warehouses to store these trains. @Derek Main well that's politics for you. . @sipho cebo True - I just can't understand the logic of protesting against bad service delivery one day and voting for self-same party that is failing on service delivery the next day. That's idiotic. R11200 per sqm?? @Derek.. who was your choice to vote for.. just curious to see if we were in favour of the same party? Lindiwe again! 
2:40:11,2:44:39, @Derek Main yes.. answer Lucy's question please @Derek Main interesting My feeling is that Holomisa is the voice of reason in parliament. He is an elder statesman. Is that Holomisas party? Yes Why not though ? "I believe the DA favours big business over citizens. If ever there is a conflict between business and citizen's rights I see "I like this Myando guy 
2:45:39,2:54:48, I hope all you lovely folks will vote for my party in 5 years time it is SAFE.. South Africa For Equality. I will not vote ANC anymore "Minister of Justice and correctional services @Keamogetswe Andries Motsepe you can try SAFE .. check Lucy's comment @Keamogetswe Andries Motsepe At least you are giving your vote some thought - unlike the ANC voters. They think they're supporting a soccer team. Mr Peter Mabena what do you mean any seriousness in minister of justice and correctional services? New justice minister Ronald Kalula must take this thieves toe to toe "With my party it will be SAFE 
2:55:40,3:00:47, Self sufficient that is "Lucy Well I take a leaf from Singapore's history "To reach 100 votes why is that? Voters are smart EFF to pay Trevor Manual R500 000. So glad. "where is Adv Maleka? so glad too 
3:01:45,3:03:44, @ Thami I take that as an insult and voters are not smart they voted the ANC again that's not smart. @Lucy Lucy is that true? "bullying other people just because they hold different view such not be allowed "We have instructed our attorney's to appeal not even courts should allowed to silence the truth 500k plus public apology ðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ Yes on the news. The EFF will not get away with insulting and intimidating anyone. @Keamogetswe Andries Motsepe Not that smart - the majority voted ANC "True to that no more taking of bullying from them
