time,7:43,message The Judge is not present? No way dont tell me she has not pitched again? This judge is so disrespectful yerr She must be subpoenaed warrant of arrest granted Given the poor track record of this alledged judge Zondo will not be supprised she hasnt pitched. Question what will he do? This is a test of the Commission's power! Morning all @Redeemed Sinner 😀 Spot on 
7:55,10:40, he needs to issue a subpoena "Like now Zondo must be in jail @Mike Clark agree @Jackson Van Staden -why? Judge Makhubela should be ashamed of herself honestly "@Caroline Hawanga - exactly how much money has he wasted on this commission and for what ? he is looting public funds @Jacqui Baumgardt this is circus 
10:53,12:53, Camera lady is insane "Zondo is too soft on these implicated persons. Government ministers She didn’t come again? I thought she was told that she should come and state her case why it must be postponed in person. She is here I think I bet next time she will say she's got Covid. Bfware of the state capture looter's defendants Stalingrad strategy is the way of the ANC crooks and Zuptas. Thanks @Mangalani Mangalani it’s better if she is here I wil be suprise 🤬. she must be arrested. 
13:46,15:49, is she into politics 🤔 Why is the camera lady not showing her face @Dan Brown nicely put. Thats the plan of the government and she is using it here. The chair needs to be ruthless with her wa delela nwana loyi. @Jacqui Baumgardt I agree. She will keep playing hide and seek if DCJ allows this postponement So she is stitting there wow what a cheek and insult does she need preferential treatment? who cares if she's a sitting judge she jolly well should be impeached! 
16:07,17:20, why is she elected We don’t care if this could get her impeached. We are talking about state capture here. If it means she must be impeached then so be it. @Mike Clark I hope she won't get her way today 🤞 She is a sitting corrupt judge! "I think Zondo has got the ""Stockholm Syndrome"" where he is a hostage to these Corrupt politicians and people and becoming their buddies." ducking and diving - theat firepool is becoming very useful "Go This lawyer is very poor. I will be surprised if Judge Makhubele doesn't change him too. He can't even put forward a convincing argument @Caroline Hawanga I agree if she does she makes a mockery of this commission and the 80 whatever miilions spent. This becomes a circus. 
17:37,18:56, Don’t allow this madness DCJ 800 Million True dat @Luthando Xhamlayo Does she really think she is above the law??Like Zuma?? Mmm she step down Just issue a warrant for her immediate arrest go zondo "@Caroline Hawanga In fact I would can the commission today 
19:03,20:46, DCJ is going for the jugular Waste of taxpayer money! "@Gerda Oh she's there These politically connected fat cats are so used to bullying the judicial system helped by the ANC. There’s no space for that here. They think they can talk nonesense and DCJ must be sympathetic. So I bet she will not take off her mask if she speaks to hide her shame. "Cain  "She will testify today yep! 
21:08,22:40, she's breathing heavily can you imagine if Hlope was a chief Justice 👽 we must arrest all these corrupt thugs including this excuse of a judge what Zondo will not alow this !! almost up to a month on an affidavit Bathathe Zondo. We’ve had enough. wata I think that as of today we will have 1 less crooked judge on the bench 
23:00,25:21, exactly We must just start with today's evidence and stop explaining to this attorney. He already knows everything the DCJ is explaining to him. she admitted Guilt The show must go on!Time waster ...this woman must testify today!!! Application will be decline and she will take the stand under oath she must just admit wrong doing and the show move on Wata I ll bet Lucky Montana is watching to see & get some tips as what he is going to do to weasel out of explaining his massive wealth and luxury houses "We waiting for so long for this day 
25:21,28:06, Mmm wo exactly @Musa Mabunda cheers 😀 @Musa Mabunda did you say something about beer? she is a public official that stepped down There she is she look scared😂😂 You’re a wise man brother @Musa Mabunda 👊🏿 
28:17,29:38, Oh she'e ordering a beer her hands in the air so so smooth "DCJ Zondo says we can proceed without her affidavit Judge Makhubela is a sitting judge and is afraid that she will be impeached. as she raises her hand I hope it is to say she is ready to start "Zondo lets start now "@Thulani Bukani hahahahahaha yes she has no affidavit she has to go under oath 
30:08,31:30, zondo ur the man "As she drags this out I see a huge drain with our hard earned tax money going down it @Redeemed Sinner 🤣🤣🤣🤣 he hasn't and now he comes publicly and do some naughty things whilst owing us has de klerk and land thieves paid back our money yes The Judge has been sworn under oath is her lawyer Mr nxasane? lol she wants to hide Thought so that mask is not coming off 
31:32,32:39, yes She wanted to represent herself and she was told it's nonsense and she must take oath lol the mask was never going to come off criminal of a judge Yaaa I lose great lol at last let the games begin That mask thing was a stunt still nxa She looks and sounds childish. She probably thinks this is a joke stupid woman. how was she appointed a judge. 
33:01,34:41, She was appointed during the Zuma regime Oh yes Lootfreely House will bank roll her- they are loaded with our cigarette tax lawyer fired Nxasana under the bus \ Nxasana under the 🚌 "hey wena 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can bet she will say apartheid somewhere soon. 
34:52,35:56, What is she saying? exactly But lawyers do it all the time. @Granny Mokwena 🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a banana! ok I have attended courts numerous times I have decided I will rather represent myself Compenatant black law firm what kind of insult is that! Are thier incompetant law firms?. And who cares what is the race please do NOT play the race card with us This is going to be a looooong day!! 
36:00,38:04, Mmm """i will explain ok Is she gonna tell us why she wants a postponement? "Black Competent Lawyers you are arrogant she's in competent this one Mmm I'm an American. So I'm confused lol. What is she trying to say? Is she saying that BLM all over the world matters?! 
38:10,40:16, @Luthando Xhamlayo yes agreed lets keep race out of this- """i will explain @Bongani Shibambu you are so right. your reputation of dishonesty precedes you unfortunately Shakoane lawyers are useless 😂😂😂 I call them verbal vampires. will she allow this nonsense from an accused if it was in her court? 😗😗😗😗 yes sir 
40:50,42:32, What is the relevance of all that she is saying about correspondence from the commission? Shakoane lawyers must be given an opportunity to defend themselves. I wouldn’t want to use their services after what the learned Honorable High Court Judge Makhubele Exactly @Singi Mathebula this person is doing everything in her power to delay the hearing of her evidence... mxim let's get going special favours????? "Precisely Caroline. She's a 'verbal vampire'. She'll talk your ears off direct comms with CJ Under her watch she managed to agree to a huge loss of transnet money - for the benefit of less than reputable suppliers - like the siyayas 
42:51,44:50, This women shes talking absolutely rubbish youbare an ordinary person just like all the rest of us Here is educated Hlaudi Motsoeneng This magogo she's wasting our time """im not an ordinary person""" "The time is 10 no you are not an ordinary person you are a compleat squirmer yes sir ok 
44:55,46:18, "can this lady just shut and admit all his transgressions say something that means something? This lady is arrogant. Ministers have appeared before this commission. She must be thinking she's running SA. Hmmm LET'S GET GOING!!!!! "Watching this "😂😂😂 @Mangalani Mangalani ""Here is educated Hlaudi Motsoeneng""" impeach her and get some competence on the bench and in the commission yes 
46:26,48:36, make it official Hahaha...I have never seen anything like this. What is the honourable judge trying to say here? who is this now fellow compatriots? udume ngani? This woman is demonstrating a brilliant example of what is known as 'obfuscation'. A big word that simply means to blow lots of smoke into people to cloud the ability to see or get to the facts.... @Mangalani Mangalani 😁 Same class "Judge Zondo is reaping what he sowed right now. From the moment he allowed the first person to use delaying tactics she has to make her statement official Judge was a Senior Counsel but I wonder what is wrong with her moving her own direct application. it has to be official 
48:59,50:29, @anele mtiki this has nothing to do with accent. Content is just poor yes that's misrepresentation YES BUT her lawyers misrepresented her "This is a case of ""if you can't blind him with science  they were bribed sir they are infidel Delay tactics 
50:37,53:03, The blind leading the blind! Adv Nxasana is unimpressed Seems to be using the Stalingrad Tactics same as Nhleko to drag out testimony so rambling and verbose that the commission will not be able to make any meaningful progress. she is under duress her lawyer misrepresented her in court they were bribed they are infidel how this was made a judge is a mystery... she is applying delaying tactics a day wasted The poor lawyer came all the way from Durban and now she is talking?? They were your attorneys - so what is the problem - they acted on your instruction - and you are supposed to be well versed in the law - so what has this speech got to do with the present situatiion? Kasi hi yimele yini? 
53:12,54:26, CHAIRPERSON SHE DOESN'T KNOW ZOOM @Gerda 7 The lawyers will be paid. Now she blames the lockdown??ai ai Obviously a case where corona could have helped resolve this issue? one hour wasted BY THE TIME ZONDO ERRRRRR HAAAA HEEEE THEY WILL NEED ANOTHER TEN YEARS TO FINALISE NOT JCC SHE WAS SAYING ZCC COVID-19 is a wonderful excuse used by all nefarious characters. "This is going to be a other wasted day. When the DCJ spoke last week 
54:45,58:00, "Mangalani So virtual consultation - that works for the rest of the world - couldn't be used by this arrogant lady? Mmm "So her claim will be when ""unable to brief her council"" when her bullcrap is exposed will claim given under duress so unfair outcome." Besides what she stole @Gerda 7 It’s her money but you are right she’s also wasting commission/our money what they tell you Mmm "there's no need to explain and explain and affidavits just tell the truth 
58:02,59:37, Wasting Taxpayers money "A person in her position should do all she can to assist the commission if she is innocent DELAY TATICS the chair must make her pay costs for today's session my attorneys let me down...playing the blame game..🤣🤣🤣 my attorneys let me down. whose problem is that 🤔 what is happening today? WHO CHOSE HER LEGAL TEAM Are her lawyers white ?

I would have lost my marbles by now. WE SLEPT AT 4AM If this was a white judge ; blaming black lawyers ...well at least no incompetence on the chat Wow! No wonder our courts have such a backlog of cases. Come on Zondo please tell her to stop wasting your time. 
1:01:54,1:02:53, trying to buy the judges face. i didn't want to defy your order chair🙄🙄 useless.. One hour wasted with excuses - DCJ lets get it on. She's using Stalingrad appoach!!! Eish this woman maan Blah...blah....blah she`s trying by all means to sound innocent "she is incompetent ok 
1:03:29,1:05:13, This woman can't see that the judge is not interested in her nonsense "So she can talk This woman though... SHE IS EXPLAINING HERSELF MEANING SHE IS GUILTY Imagine poor lawyers who have to bring other matters to her court. They’re doomed as she has axe to grind & already accuse them of incompetent Mmm Finish her DCJ go for her DCJ """I think we need to have some kind of finality

I feel like none of them will get arrested She has an attitude Maybe because she is guilty? "the only thing that can save her from testifying is to be a drama queen expecting her to suddenly start coughing and Covid19 being blamed. 
1:26:37,1:41:38, Guilty !! It's not so difficult to see when someone is guilty especially when under pressure "Ms Ngoye must have suffered a lot under this woman Welcome to South Africa. The country with corrupted politicians who steal money and the country with the third highest crime rate on Earth. Enjoy your stay! Why does not STOP her "please chairperson dont allow judge makhubele to use delay tactics clearly there must be bouncers in the commission to force other people to speak the truth A This is my opportunity to make a scientific study of how long 10 minutes lasts in Africa. Stopwatch is ready. 
1:45:23,1:50:42, Pity us who can only crawl backwards. is there a time keeper here? no. this is south africa. @Cedric Man Yan - we live in Zumaland Who says that Judge ZONDO cant keeo time it's 11 :50 they must b done by 12pm "ANC heavyweight and former cabinet minister Nomvula Mokonyane’s 40th birthday was held at the Victorian Guest House in 2003 1:07 paused while Zondo speaks Zondo is already thinking this people a joke

1:55:11,1:58:54, POSTPONEMENT ENTANGLEMENT "must say no Now hinting that she might fire her team? She is like watching an ANC mp bull crap his way thru another lie in parliament. What a disgrace this woman is. It’s 11.57 and we just want the truth. Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha He is going to decline Darkside That's the real Darkside the commision must re imburse my data. its like watching paint dry. going nowhere slowly. 
1:58:57,2:00:08, DC Comics "But she stands to lose a pension for life inflation linked currently at R157 DCJ must decline this frivolous application address the judge as Darkseid Zondo spitting facts now I suspect that this judge will soon resort to crying the only tactic left for postponement is tears Mmm Mxolisi Nxasana looks clueless for someone who was a NPA director

2:04:02,2:05:15, And throw away the integrity of the entire legal fraternity We've been going around in circles lol poor advocate Is the advocate sweating ? They only justice she deserves is talking that’s all.She must talk now Playing legal games to stall things yes The advocate isn’t poor. He’s been instructed to apply for something that doesn’t make sense by his client. Adv Nxasana should have never agreed to represent his client.Maybe he's desperate for business or something..Professional integrity means nothing these days.People will do anything for money. 
2:05:57,2:07:39, Drupwa Drupwa Drupwa Drupwa Who placed that burden on the advocate ? The client judge did ! "My question is why would a HC JUdge need legal representation of people who are not on her ""academical""" level? Nxasana is in trouble..🤣🤣🤣 try academic cloete u need assistance yourself @Sharon your question is exactly why a medical doctor would.need another doctor to treat him when he is sick The Judge and her Attorney are waiting time. But I also think that the Attorney was not briefed properly. "I have no clue whats happening here 
2:07:56,2:09:39, Certainly not yours cain I think this Advocate is destroying the bit of integrity that he had. He must have seen how the previous Advocate struggled to defend this judge. She makes all these guys look very incompetent. I just assisted u nje. it's Academic not academical! 🤣 🤣 🤣 no back mouthing the judge zip your lip I still maintain that this commission should have put at least 2 other retired Judges to assist the DCJ.
