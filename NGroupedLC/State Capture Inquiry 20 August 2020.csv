Robert McBride is meant to be questioned today. ipid This guy was bought to forged lies against those competent investigators such as Booysen oh-ohhh 
53:06,1:09:24, ha suffers the zuma-illness "I don’t understand why those guys  """IT WILL B ECSTASY DE DAY ' DOCKETS' GO DIGITAL & NOT ' RESIDE' IN 'VEHICLES' OF INVESTIGATORS""" Six Some of these guys cannot even remember what htey have written in their own affidavits McBride should be on after lunch break. ok """Zuma-amnesia"" is prevalent to all his cronies 😂😅🙈" No someone else wrote the statement for them.he looks very confused 
1:09:28,1:29:40, Eliot Chauke 👍👍👍👍 WHY???? Tea break...the Labour Relations Act makes provision for it... 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Tea break. lets have some coffee or something else seeing that it is legal now and the aeroplane just flew over something else will do.. to ring in the weekend..😁 Chair seemed uninterested. What time are they resuming? Zondo is sleeping on duty Who is with MTI? 
1:34:35,1:41:31, 😂😂😂 he's so pressed! @Melvict Melbourne MTI is ponzi skeem It is not VBS was licensed and a ponzi "trust me there are no evidence of their trading sorry y'all I entered this live late who's this guy I trade with my own computer. have written code that does the transactions and make money. MTI does the same. "just get your money out before it collapses 'Fact' ..where is the evidence? 
1:42:51,1:45:23, WELL WE WILL INVESTIGATE AND REPORT BACK TO OURSELVES The problem is that there are R2.9 bn not in the hand of the banks. "Here's a 'fact': 2 + 2 is 4 Why can't you make 0.1-0.6 % per day? This person is a BRIGADIER??? some days you make -03% Homie can’t read hahahahah 
1:45:57,1:49:03, They break things. Adadudedum attempt Bot that does trading is not new. Bot's can process trends and data much faster than humans. they sell and buy not on emotion. Addendum ... haha haha "Our minister of police is called ""General Cele"" despite having qualified only as a school teacher." The best general was Idi Amin. only? ad teacher... Of course he isn’t aware lol 🙄🤪 
1:49:12,1:52:27, Why do need drivers? "@Antoinette Meyer I don't know about police but to obtain military rank there is formal training and qualification required to attain rank where ""general"" is equivalent to phd." so that they can have both hands free to steal Tomorrow is Friday!!! 😂 This guy is sinking into the swimming pool All thugeries is not remembered by perpetrators cause they don't want to incremenate themselves. Is by choice not to remember. Certain positions in government departments permits them having a driver. This too existed under the National Party. There is nothing untoward many ministers in theNP drove themselves. 
1:53:23,1:56:42, "It is proper for retired military officers above the rank of Captain to continue to use their military rank as their formal title (instead of ""Mr"") However that is not the protocol for the police." What did George Fivaz call himself after he left the SAPS? George 😜 If he can’t find page 2 how can he find 337 this is shocking!! thats a way to buy time and get his ducks in a row Yeah touch his microphone more poor man. out of his intellectual depth 
1:57:33,2:01:25, since when does brigadiers do investigations? oops Brigadier seems to be an honorary rank for comrades. Wrong date hmm lol must have been in many shebeens that day I don't know why but I'm feeling sorry for this man. Mr. P O'Sullivan once went into Alex (Jhb) for an investigation. This was when he was a SAPS reservist. In the course of this endeavor a suspect dropped his partner with a brick to the head. 😂😂🤪🤪🤪 this old man no he must tell the truth that’s all Paul shot the suspect dead one dead brick thrower... marvelous 
2:04:50,2:08:37, This let a person fall a sleep i just woke up now.i think he is note telling the trth.ewake me up once he tell the truth this guy is now starting to peddle water "I just tuned in one investigation investigating another investigating. Double investigation into a corrupt investigation Ok He’s Imagine - this Brigadier is in charge of 100's SAPS members. We are lead! The cherry on top they don’t have a schedule! Meetings are all random apparently. 
2:09:05,2:13:27, "Saxonwold meeting area He doesn't have a smart watch i am now awake Time is running out take important points mr Haley please "“I don’t remember In the military a brigadeer is usually in charge of three to six battalions (1000 per battalion). Does anyone know if and how it differs in police force? Brigadiers take care of the communal beer fridge the witness self doesn't know what he is testifying about he can't even find page numbers in front of him. In SAPS a brigadier is someone who gets parachuted into a position he/she does not deserve as long as he/she is politically connected 
2:13:35,2:20:31, 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😭😭😭😭...in charge of beer fridge "I think this fella was a part time poacher and became known as "" bring a deer "" when invited to mates braai's." lol Took the phone without a subpoena. Criminal offence Police do not know the law Hahaha forgot he took it while getting some cigarettes on Marlboro drive Party cadres have to have jobs and are deployed strategically. There are posts that require the most intelligent but they deploy the least intelligent so as to use them in carrying out nefarious acts. I suspect that high ranking officers in SAPS and SANDF outnumber low ranking officers. Any stats out there? That is how it works Watson. 
2:20:41,2:24:35, So no reason for a subpoena ¿ no implication in the crime and they still seized it? are you aware that most witnesses before the commission especially those from anc don't remember anything about all corrupt activities they have done. they are in a dream land. Did they just read out someone’s I’d o Just gave us her ID Wild new Edgars account here i come. Oh ... wait No warrant help me understand has zandile gumede cleared her name "I merely think we may have to redefine corruption 
2:25:06,2:31:57, waste of energy n time She hasn’t still waiting her dates for court @ Daniel Mkhabela @Elton...u quite ryt ...wht. a waste of tym There is not sufficient time provided to question witness. And will sponsore my understanding at som What is the aim of the commission? To act as a commission Cadres only volunteer to do something when they can steal "Look many inaccuracies here 
2:32:05,2:41:18, "O Sullivan is everywhere His clients Which are? No idea "He is a private investigator @ Melvict Melbourne when state seemed wanting You defeated yourself 🤣🤣🤣 """ IT WILL B ' JUSTICIABLE' IF DIS COMMISSION B TRANSFERRED 2 ADV. BATOHI STOCK & BARREL""" Arrogant people such as this guy
