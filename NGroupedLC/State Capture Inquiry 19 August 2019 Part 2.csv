time,10:54,message Jeep DCJ pedantic on pagenation but time for us when they say would start seems to be ignored WHO IS IN THE HOT SEAT TODAY Well there is saying that the wheels of justice moved slowly "@Mbuso Ndlovu Former National Director of Public Prosecutions he must just pay back 17m @Diss & Dad How are you my Precious friend. U was missed. R10m @Michael Mika. The rest was taxes "no he should

I pray you had a blessed weekend Pastor had a fabulous weekend thanks so muchüòó @Thando Nkutha We missed you my friend. Welcome back Four Bossassa guys were arrested. Out on R20k bail each Does Zondo brings his own lunch or he takes from the commission? 
16:51,17:33, Eish I think all the evidence missingü§£ü§£ü§£ zondo is taking a nap "@Khaya Nomoyi the commission must complete with hearings Maybe they are still setting up the audio "Whats happening üòÇüòÇ here we go The big fish.. Gavin Watson of Bosasa must be arrested. "Mbuso

"can not recall names Thanks Rob arrrest the criminal please 
21:37,27:39, "@whitepope5 ""The ANC cannot be expected to commit suicide. If the ANC were to remove all criminals from their lists "Agrizzi and the other witnesses who worked for Bosasa To me this was just a waste of money.What happened to the recommendations of the Marikana Commission.Its still gathering dust at the President's office.The same will happen with this one. @Thando Nkutha most of the time most of the people here are not following the full time so it might be hard to update you @Thando Nkutha Nothing to do with Estina - it's about how Nxasana was axed by Zuma and how Jiba & Mwebi plotted to get him fired from NPA. They supported Zuma's enquiry on his fitness to hold office. "T@Khaya Nomoyi If Zondo's recommendations will affect the party as one in government @Thando Nkutha No problem The absolute end for Jiba. how much is Zondo charging a day by just sitting and say Yessss...Yesssss. Yessssss ?????? 
27:41,33:06, R17 million was offered ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ @Thando Nkutha That's right - it seemed like hush money at the time. And highly irregular. "Zondo asks many questions I salute Judge Zondo. Judge Zondo became a lawyer with the help of a Indian shopkeeper. Guys didn‚Äôt this Nxasana‚Äôs name mentioned in various documents including the book The president‚Äôs keeper‚Äù that he is one of the diehard Zuma‚Äôs keepers? @Ibo Thabo I don't think so - he wanted to reinstate charges against Zuma and hence he was pushed out of NPA Definitely Not one of Zumas Keepers. 
33:26,35:27, @Derek agree He got a golden handshake from Zuma for R170000 @Derek Main But didn‚Äôt on the beginning he was Zuma militia? Zuma did not know he would be a witness at this commission. Trying to take credit for something here ? üòÄ @ Lorraine Naidoo ‚ÄãJ udge Zondo became a lawyer with the help of a Indian shopkeeper. @Diss & Dad U are absolutely right. I was at the house when the killings happened. Diss he was interviewed on tv nd told his story DCJ was able to study law with the help of an Indian shopkeeper who provided his family with food every month. You are missing som zeros@Lorraine Naidoo. You must also note that that handshake was taxed. The taxes went to SARS. So he owes us the difference 
36:06,39:33, @Lorraine Naidoo U are absolutely right. It was a Muslim shopkeeper in Ixopo. They still run a scholarship programme together. The same shopkeeper gave his mom vouchers every month . Google about the story . DCJ also told the story at the hearing where he was being interviewed for the position of Deputy Chief Justice Pastor Judge cried whole telling his story you're absolutely right Lorraine Naidoo Bombshells coming this afternoon @Diss & Dad It was painful and traumatic. A lot of that anger from then still exists We are waiting patiently for it @ Magda Seguin @Pastor J Long time dear Mfundisi. How are you treasured Sir? 
39:52,44:59, @Pastor J Not . the kind of trauma one gets over "My issue with this guy as a witness "Makhosi nice to see familiar friends ...I missed you @Anne M. Definately so. Pain. Anguish. Anger and a very deep sense of loss. They were an amazing couple who I new closely and very personally. A deeply loved couple I wonder what Pastor J looks like?? I can‚Äôt believe what comes out of Zondo‚Äôs mouth sometimes ! He is biased? Zondo is triying to dig the whole truth We Africans always fight against each other.Nothing changed in 25 years.This is a perfect example. poverty is human made the level of greed & corruption is at global celebrity status 
45:12,47:12, THIS MASUTU...Hmmmmmmmmm @Diss & Dad Absolutely. Sadly the bad deeds where actually executed by non-white security branch policemen. .uxuo "@jasper dougal he is preparing the witness to withstand cross examination kkok @John Fagan there seem to be something about him Who brought the Guptas into RSA??? YEAH....For me he aint Clean "I believe and have read and seen pictures of the terrible atrocities and murders the freedom fighting terrorists commited against Africans 
47:50,53:58, @Born free I must agree with you. You are right it did happen Zuma invited the Guptas "There has been a few dodgy moments when Zondo has given me cause for concern  @Thando Nkutha very dodgy @Diss & Dad They received bonuses for special tasks. @Diss & Dad They never did hence the lingering and continued anger by so many people Terrorists/Freedom fighters had Cuban and Russian handlers. "@Diss & Dad In the late 80""s I was the courier for some docs into Lusaka. I cleverly booked into 2 diff hotels. I had supper and went to room and then slipped away to the other hotel." @Diss & Dad An hour after the supper the room was bombed by the same people I had supper with 
54:41,1:00:04, ok @Diss & Dad In those days your left hand should never have trusted the right hand Clearly it is Monday So am I SA is ruled by the communist party. Bless them. The DCJ will never expose himself to be seen to be partial. whomever thinks he is biassed is not au fait with judicial ethics. Many people paid the ultimate price. @Diss & Dad Absolutely. The regime was ruthless and there was no hesitation to eliminate any level of threat. Even a non violent person like me suffered some very painful moments 
1:00:41,1:04:47, Yes and look at the country today.. is it any better off?? my opinion the country is in a worse state than it was @Born free You are right my friend. A lot of sacrifices for the nonsense we have now makes it feel somewhat useless at times. No one knew better @Pastor J I often think what my life would have been if it was not for apartheid and how I had to flee the country as a very young woman @Magda Seguin At least we can tell the difference but painful I had so much hope in 1994 when I returned to SA but now find myself again in another continent.I am so homesick its not funny @Thando Nkutha Unfortunately not as many as I would like too but mabe Ministry played a big part for that "@Magda Seguin  @Thando Nkutha Those buggers where ANC members based in Lusaka. Askaris 
1:05:17,1:07:07, absolutely We will see if the recommendations of this commission will be implemented @Gee Pee√ó1 its not a reality show or a tv show....its about personal exp√©riences in how the state was captured bankrupting state agences and SOEs I think the R17 million was very attractive to him. "the ANC had @Thando Nkutha We have all changed in different ways. I am sure that they have regrets and I have tons of forgiveness to give are we at commisson of reconciliation......@pastor j and others...whats going on here.?. No more laughs at Zuma now we got him If I was offered R17 million I too would have taken the offer. 
1:07:41,1:11:26, @Rob Nel to live in security as a single women and have autonomy on my finances hello hi @Diss & Dad Absolutely brilliant people "I found that even living in a gated community I was not safe Hi prez you must hear what these people say about you it wasn't me. hahahaha I know prez This guy is a liar. Zuma was not there 
1:12:05,1:13:35, This is a HEAD ? I know Jacob was at the meeting @Daud Musa how do you know that he was not there? Patience @Gee Peex1 most of my friends on this forum has been here since August last year for the testimonies...we all love SA & want to know what happened to put us on this disastrous failed state Lets get facts first and assessment later. Now we not sure if someone is a liar or not. @Daud Musa and you can prove that ? "All these ""Top Dogs"" sound like they wer straight in from Grade R !" @Magda Seguin Absolutely right Im in France...Im a dual EU citizen so it was an easy decision 
1:13:48,1:17:40, @ibo I was working with this liar Pleasure my friend I did not live in this country during apartheid years but statics report that this is a lawless country and the highest crime rate in the world or very close to it. ok "My wish is that ordinairy citizens loser on the hierarchy blow the whistle "Zuma was staying at Mahlamba Ndlovu "I heard of Dulcie when I was in exile Great man @Pastor J is. I have great respect for this man Imagine with R17M what can you do ..... 
1:17:54,1:18:31, why is this FomNPA always refering to conclusions he made without factual responses.?....and struggling to bring Zuma in his lies..... Did he take the money ? "@Magda Seguin Agree Aish this chap is fabricating scattered facts. No real issues he is just going about issues. Hey @Sofia Sofia üòç Hey @Lex Luger ‚ù§ "I was much younger than Dulcie the way he brought it up its pure fabrication. He would not have been paid R17million if the CCMA was involved. 
1:18:43,1:22:41, @Lex Luger I try to tell you everyday that I love you my brother. You are special bro Did this man take the money ? @Pastor J Ngiyabonga Mfundisi wam Yes it was a golden handshake this was a Platinum handshake. In my opinion and I say my opinion - the way he sounds I also don't think he was fit for anything .... Then again he got 17M for snacks !!!! Joining the ANC after fleeing the country was a problem a lot of people were targeted and branded as spies hence a lot of us were rejected even with spotless credentials I think he was fit but he was pushed because Jiba wanted his position. Zuma and Jiba enabled each other. Is the the 17 million rand guy? 
1:23:25,1:27:08, What problems does he have 17MILLION RANDS LATER ... NIKS @Cerebis Yes I am happy that I was not accepted as we heard news of the killings of ANC cadres in Camp Quatro in Angola that was ordered by Zuma who was the head of intelligence there @Anne M. Thanks Ann....just joined the chat. üëç yhioo the judge get very excited when there is a direct reference to what Zuma said I was in Botswana at the time...there was one refugee transit camp run by the UNHCR near Gaborone (Kagisong)and another in the northern border with Zim called Dukwe @Diss & Dad that was apartheid state propoganda we will see who is tell the truth 
1:27:44,1:30:10, HE don't know Gupta pressurized Zuma to rid of you agh..this guy want to bring in Guptas as the otger people... but cant find any other way to include Guptas since no one mentioned Guptas.... Nxasana was fit enough and not politisized. This man was and is a stand up man. We know Zumas faction had everything to do with his dismissal. "No news about Zuma coming back again . I thought he was going to have a short time answering written questions and then would be back The ANC will implode eventually...the writing is on the wall "I would really like to know when they sit down to talk ""business"" how do they speak .... do they sound DOM like this ?" It was Jiba and Mwyrebi People should come to this commissions to tell the truth not to save their skins 
1:30:37,1:33:43, no problem i will leave but I must get paid.....of course Many careers were destroyed during the era of. imagine dismissing these man without any fact on the table they should definitely bring in those so called people in the Zuma presidency..... "They do!! I was in presidential and many other state organis√© meetings and parliament...in hindsight it amounts to talk shops Whhhat @Diss & Dad we also spent many feels in safe houses Hope the commission will ask Zuma to pay back this R10m instead of this guy. This man went through a lot in few months he was there. Yes Chair dig the truth because Pretorious has his own agenda "I believe that Nxasana could not go against the Zuma faction 
1:34:42,1:37:44, Nxasana never asked the president(Zuma) to approve his vacating of his post at NPA; Zuma baba phola this boys are playing. This was in 2014. State capture began in 1994 but escalated when Zuma became President in 2008/2009 "In Botswana we used to pick-up ANC cadres who crossed the border Malema already said we will die for Zuma "It funny that Zuma had ""Death Threats "" while he was on here ... But he is still alive .... Assassins have let us down ...." Zuma was clever to leave evidential trails in his dealings suspecting even that Xnasana will record him so his reluctance to meet him Even though the ANC didnt recognise many if us we still continued with the struggle ans helping our compatriotes "Yes Malema said "" We will kill for Zuma to be President ""." 
1:38:39,1:43:26, Nowonder how Zuma will respond to this üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇüòÉüòÉüòÉ I can‚Äôt wait "Malema was 11 years told when Tata was released "I extricated myself from the ANC when Zuma came to power  "makhosi nobhatyi Zuma's answer is one"" √è can't recall saying that'""" But who appointed Adv Nxasana üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ @ Ntembeko Mabuya but if he cannot answer this time we will connect the dots "I do believe that CR is fighting an uphill battle @Magda Seguin true "Chair wants to nail Hurley and Zuma 
1:43:29,1:47:23, Can someone apologise for this 25 year old Regime of corruption?? "Magda You got that right makhosi nobhatyi that's how stupid our former president is. When asked question they were connecting the dot's based on what was said by the people who were asked to come forward to testify "@ Magda Seguin it is long overdue saying CR must wake up and try to fight "Diss &Dad üôèMy late husband and I did it for the future of the children of the country The Zuma years seem worse than Apartheid?! "Whatever happens @ ntembeko mabuya he think he will dodge the lawsuit as he used before surely no forest to hide himself now 
1:48:58,1:53:57, @Tholithemba Ntsele Zuma keeping previously disadvantaged people as currently disadvantaged? It pains me that so many honest people were hounded out during the Zuma years to make way for looters and Gupta acolytes..their lives and livelihoods was destroyed @Diss & Dad I completed the manuscript for my book but my first attempt to have it published was rejected but I may publish it myself "@Tholithemba Ntsele That is not the point. Zuma created a new apartheid. The connected few @ Diss & Dad I fully agreed with you lairs how does this file get missing Magda Seguin Thta shows lack of leadership of JZ he was there for Looting S.A Coffers Stop the racism At least Capetown is delivering unlike the rest of the country. Viva DA 
1:54:46,1:58:33, Viva DA bu what Nxasana and Zondo is futile now because this case was heard by Concourt and he lost why argue this now DA nonsense .viva eff EFF are the jokers of the pack "@Tholithemba Ntsele Apartheid is a fact yes thanks Thando Every time the EFF opens their mouth.. it costs them money and unfortunately the Rand takes a dive. "@ Ntsele : Of course 
1:59:58,2:01:34, we want our land back DA @Diss & Dad publishing these days are not so easy...they mostly want sensation that bring in the bottom line No I am a lion and poaching was unheard of. Apartheid era was bad. Zuma era is worse. bring back our land If you have Netflix check out two documentaries; "Though written as Makhene @Tholithemba Ntsele i dont you need not to be white or indian rather its a question of foolishness & ignorant Bring back the Dinosaurs 
2:02:30,2:04:57, masutha One is : The Great Hack and the other is The Family series...you will understand what global political manipulation is all about @Thando Nkutha masutha I want no land back! Nor do I currently have any! Farming is a sure way to go bankrupt. @Born free you sound tired now. Why don't you bail out and go sleep. its true that zuma massed up Nope. these people are going to kll each and unfortunately we're going to be victims messed up? 
2:05:15,2:08:57, Radebe must come to account "The ANC allowed Zuma to carry on as he did I am doing it in my free time so I will check @Diss & Dad He ruined our economy CR17 and Radebe and Mr ARM are family members. Please hi The two ANC factions are going to be at war with each other. @Born free They already are! Killing for spots at the feeding bowl. The Great Hack is about the Cambridge Analytica scandale and The Family is about a US religious sect that influences over 100 governments worldwide of which many in Africa. 
2:11:21,2:17:08, Jeff is brother in law to Cyril "The Family has tons of money and buys politiciens including the US govt both are married to the motsepe sisters @ Thando Nkhuna Jeff and Cyril marries Motsepe sister if not wrong sisters "@Lisanda04  The Family is the testimony of an ex high ranking member of the 'sect' for lack of a better word "Patrice Motsepe's sisters - Bridgette Motsepe married to Radebe im cia 
2:17:39,2:25:04, is true buiswa this people are going to kill each other I am impressed by judge Zondo and his ability to stay in touch with everything that is going on. "This won‚Äôt happen @Brian Mercado he is sharp and attentive to details Stellenbosch Mafia @Thando Nkutha would it make a different if cr was married to a different person? @makhosi nobhatyi true "No stellenbosch mafia running the country "üòÄ üòÄ üòÄ really..? @makhosi nobhatyi ‚ÄãThis won‚Äôt happen
