As above "Stay safe folks. Enjoy the diversions 
-4:04,4:27, Eliot Chauke​Zondo is obsessed with President Zuma - So are you So am I. He has to account I am also obsessed. Waiting for him to tell us one small bit of the truth for 20years now. Even the Shaiks threw him under the bus Elizabeth... im obsessed with who? I would like to hear Mr Zuma side of story. He must avail himself. Zuma is running away now to answer questions R400 Million spent on this Commission... R0 has been recovered All the best for the new year Mzantsi

President Zuma is ill... under treatment until March. Zondo must stop this Hate... leave President Zuma alone. Zuma is showing the stae capture commission a middle finger as he now want to testify only after cr has done so

"Why is Zondo delaying mandela didnt established a commision his era so let it go bra moloi Mr Chauke WE have seen this with Shaick! Drs are not immune to fake news! 
18:36,21:33, ANC doesnt want to give us moc wat must we do fake illness i will also be ambarresed Chaps. Lets ignore Siabonga Moloi or just delete and block him The state must not be derailed! He was playing chess! Adv Masuku is hitting hard pastor j we have enough Doom this year let people behave or get it Please don't let Siabonga Moloi get you riled up. Scroll to top to see how fake accounts work. Very likely to be a fake account with the purpose of trolling Zondo is full of Hate . I am using something stronger this year. Mortein @Elvis Malakoane 
22:07,25:07, It is the Mortein @Bianca Arnold . It works. yes he is full of hate for corupters and rightfully so OK pastor j hi pastor j Zuma is running away😭😭😭😭😭😭 Greetings bafethu.. nikahle kodwa..?? Long time no see.. Right on time Masuku is moving on Nxamalalas medical conditions.. Chess games merely Danie Nilsen morning and compliments Danie blaaah blaah and zuma is an embarresment for himself "no one is Above the law including our former president 
25:27,27:16, @Elvis Malakoane morning there how are you true Itumeleng @Eliot Chauke ...Was Zuma really a President? Eliot Zondo is using by white monopoly as u see how he deal with ZUMA matter "@Eliot Chauke you misspelled your first name @Eliot Chauke what president he is nothing but a criminal to be onocent until proven guilty Pastor J... was de klerk really a president? @Pastor yes he was the best president Mlume Engrish.. hehe 
27:47,30:17, "A question for SIABONGA MOLOI @Thabelo Emmanuel ​ Do you have the evidence that the Zondo Commission is influenced by the WMC ? is not about the evidence as u see how he obsessed to Zuma all judge Zondo is not influenced by anybody he is a reputable judge and human of integrity When we seek the truth there starts again white monopoly the former president has asked for his day in court to prove his innocence remember people that day has come zuma pollsmoor are waiting for you and there are docters there too why we are taking long time by argurment Zuma wont come back 
30:47,33:55, Like Schabir ....Zuma is walking dead these lawyers hate Mr Praetorius Agreed with @ Elvis Malakoane. Judge Zondo is not influenced by anybody he is a reputable judge and human of integrity. There are allegations that must be refuted. send zuma to the same place as shabir sheik look how he got well from a termanal illness anybody that did not forsee old man hiding by playing sick..is dumb..shabbir shaik set precedent..called duck and dive..no shame in them Cant a person be arrrested without coming to the commission if that person is dodging. @Phillip Cwazibe i agree with you "Keep on dodging but one day will be one day. Even if they can say he will come in 2030 zuma is removing the frog in the throat in Cuba 
33:59,36:27, constitution..allows sickness as valid reason..in saying that ..doctors can make a case where it does not exist..shabbir shaik..case in point Zuma and his skelm behaviour is making me sick. And I thought 2020 was going to be a better year. Jacob Zuma sleeping dogs must be put down legally "Then Zuma's doctor must take the stand as well once a skelm always a skelm leopard cannot change its spots "Masuku thinks the Commission has time to play cassan SO TRUE👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Jacob Zuma's doctor must be put on polygraph machine 
36:37,37:33, "@Pastor J My precious brother all the legal fees of zuma will make it nescary for him to sell cows or wifes to pay of the debts well it was zumas kingdom at one stage guys lets forget about this state capture cause is taking all of our monies the only thing that can make us forgive and forget is to give us at least I million each citizen we are only 57m so what "yes please now now zuma I got a brother at south africa le help him to have a trp so he can visit her moom 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 @Lex Luger ...My Precious friend. Blessings to you. Great to be back. All the very best to you and your family Elvis So True 
37:35,40:58, ningesoma kidogo ningewapata vzr Zuma is playing delaying tectick again whir is dat jesys guy tell me am king Where does Zuma get these lawyers? legal team got notice yesterday..eish..2020..let the games begin they stand there and argue peripheral issues just to waste time "Wow part od game. A leopard never changes it spots 
41:52,44:32, state must put some spies at nkhandla and monitor his so called suckness.he must not come out of his room..ha ha ha zuma is making a mockery of our judicial system same as he did with his presidency thw whole world is laughing at us we are now worse than the democrats in the USA "I wonder who is benefiting with this state capture well are constition allows this behaviour..zuma not going to come..here and in courr All these supposed trips to Cuba is becoming very suspicious. Possibly smuggling drugs or bringing back money from the Gupta buggers. but looking at amended terms of reference last week his legal team told him that game is over zuma stole billions not 7m game over..eish..only startes numa is a very nice man 
44:38,48:09, Doctors letters Passport and polygraph machine for the thieves..zuma is nice man "Hi guys for people who have no class and morals they see Zuma as a hero cos they are Narcissistic if you have that info please give it to the state capture. don't lie here trying to act smart. maybe 15min Ziyanda shame for zumas latesr wife..how he going to service her..she must get divorced or bcome a nun..hahaha "Just imagine... ""His Medical Team"" what do you expect from that... People are now using medical condition strategy thinking they will survive...? a man said it with his own mouth in front of Nkandlans" The Zuma bots on here are like the Flat Earthers. Despite the evidence. The evidence does require the ability to think conceptually. 
49:10,53:34, we mast stand for our judicias zuma can full stupit people not us "he said it in Nkandla that he is fine The Zuma family must be extremely ashamed. A father for a thief. A few sons for thieves. Yoh Nkandla is on the map for all the wrong reasons. name of the doctor name of hospital and medical certificate and I repeat polygraph machine pastor j cursed zumaa family dont know wat shame means I said a while ago that this nkandla guy should be dragged to the zondo commission and answer all he has to answer they would have been done by now about Zuma call paaor mboro..make zuma young again..use doom 
55:57,59:06, ZAP HIM (ZUMA) with some preacher DOOM SEEMS TO WORK wanted!!plumber to sorr zumas plumbing..young wife cant open tap.heh heh heh heh if ugxeka u Zuma ngmane ngbone ukuthi kumnyama kakhulu kwena. namafinyila ngyadinwa nje kmele kuke kushube once cos izlima seziphapha kakhulu @Danie Nilsen ...The Doom wont work. We need something stronger Bro "they must finish with this commission and take this guy to court and charge him and if found guilty they must throw keys to the Indian Ocean where no will ever find them "I have never heard of a ""presumption of Integrity or a presumption of dignity"". I think the Commission should have its own medical team examine Zuma." canr do that..we have to follow the rules of law and order..otherwise vbs malema will kill whoever he doesnt like very true Moses but a different ocean for the keys Indian ocean is not safe "Here is a thought 
59:25,1:08:25, Zuma is nothing but a former president he must face the music of the comission that he established. thank you Zuma for Establishing the Zondo Comission no..anc waa worsr thing anc rotten to the core.. AND SOME VOTERS still vote for them are the stupid they are as stupid a s stupid can be sir! "If you still vote for the ANC Greetings and best wishes to you my friend @Derek Main "Peter Moyo has lost his case against Old Mutual and is now ""Officialy Fired""" Wonder if he can / will take it further? 
1:09:34,1:13:34, Perhaps @Derek Main Go well go she'll Mr Moyo we wish you well in your new endeavors... "It is amazing Zuma is sooo sick that he was seen on the 31st Dec at Capitec Bank with Myeni (ex SAA) in Richards Bay 140 "I mean 140km from his home Dignity... what dignity? "He had no dignity or empathy when he stole the poor peoples money Whatever involves Zuma is farcical!!! This Commission is too lenient with this skelm. Let them put him on a stretcher and he can testify on his back. 
1:14:14,1:16:20, "So Zuma is copying his fellow crook "Shame now they are going to give such lame medical reason but he is up and down @Lex Luger Exactly - and look at how well that has worked for Shaik. It's a miracle!!! Maybe Showerhead is going senile? Or does it sound like he may get better? The country is dying because of this skelem Zuma and he must be laughing at our collective naivete "The commission will never see Zuma again Seems like we need to take the law into our own hands to get anything done. "@Derek Main It is just too much brother "As crazy as it may sound 
1:16:36,1:18:03, NEVER thought I'd say this. Get Well Soon JZ. We need to see you in orange soonest. "@Lex Luger ...He may just well be very sick. Remember the comment on the ""shower"" It may have shown how wrong he was to take a shower and belive it works." precedent is set... We are now in a Selective Sickness Game... the game is on.. ha ha ha se gat man I wonder if Zondo is right for this commission. I would really have wanted Dikang Moseneke to be in charge @Thulani Bukani The justice system works for the criminals. They literally get away with murder. @Pastor J uBaba kaDuduzane is a tsotsi another tea break costs millions not on the adjourn commision 
1:18:09,1:20:43, The man was speaking at Nkandla saying he is healthy so what it is this Jz will attend the commission but will not remember anything Danie baie waar @Derek Main so true. How can it be fair for him to keep telling us his eagerness and willingness to appear but always finds ways to duck and dive. "It just sucks @Bev Daniels 😀 we mxm any developments I was off aur 
1:20:48,1:24:16, air smoke break again Zondo is too soft There were 4.8m tax payers registered in RSA last year supporting a population of 57 million as well as a bloated government. It can't last. "We can all relax Next thing Zuma is going to tell us he doesn't have taxi money. @Derek Main ...Thankfully I still have the very old donkey attached to my cart. He will come as long as the commission grows a backbone and compels him. "I'd like to know who is paying his lawyers and senior counsel plus all the trips to Cuba for ""medical treatment""." @Anne M. Gaddaffi's gold 
1:24:30,1:28:53, "Zuma will win an Olympic Gold for the ""duck and dive"" game." 😀 Anne M he pays himself cos gauteng high court annulled his agreement had with state Same will happen with his corruption charges There only reason Zuma takes so much flak about not appearing is because we have seen how he operates. The Stalingrad strategy. "@Elvis Malakoane Correct Also I don't believe that the South African electorate understands just how many criminals they elect each election cycle. ALL is covered up by the oft repeated phrase of RET. I have maybe Guptas yes Shaikh is done with him @Pastor J 😀 And the bronze medal for ?\ 
1:29:54,1:37:33, "Koos "Yup The lawyer invoking Ubuntu is rich - what Ubuntu did Zuma feel for the poor millions when he was stealing the money? "As my late mother used to say ""you don't need money to have manners or respect for others""." Anne M your was very right Anne may she rest in peace mom pastor j I see Moyo lost against Old mutual appeal for reinstatement @Pastor J @Elvis Malakoane I'm not sure what to think of the Old Mutual / Peter Moyo situation. Who do you side with? So everybody apprearing can play this card who aloud it vi ex president so why should it be any different for someone else 
1:37:45,1:39:49, @Anne M. The bronze we will keep for the hones athletes "Our country is a mess it is very confusing to me because they don't disclose exact source of dispute "@Derek Main He moved 100million without proper process as a dividend another runner "Derek Main . Surely a CEO is just an employee "Trevor Manual @Pastor J Dividend to himself? "Derek Main ​Trevor Manual 
1:40:07,1:45:09, A company he owns@Derek Main sie antie gaan nie lieg nie @Pastor J Hmmm - very suspicious. He must be an ANC member. @Concerned South African Do you know anything about the Rothchilds? Yes I do. Where is the proof TM works for them? sound is bad this lady is the one who spoke about Ambassador Kolane and and Gupta landing @Concerned South African Look at Daily Maverick - an article by Richard Poplak dated 3 October 2014. He was appointed as senior advisor and Deputy Chairman of Rothchild South Africa. yes has he retired 
1:45:59,1:51:34, Koloane should be in jail for treason. "@concerned South African Ms G. Thanks. Does anyone remember or watched the movie Midnight Express and particularly the jail in the movie? @Pastor J Yes - I do. Read the book before I saw the movie. Yes Keep that jail in mind @Derek Main Horrific conditions - exactly what the state capturers deserve. I think we need to start taking away rights of certain categories of criminals. pastor j or the The pelican Brief by Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts 
1:51:46,1:57:56, when is Zuma coming? True @Elvis Malakoane Hi All what have I missed as I just tuned in. @Moeletsi Wabatho Just Zuma giving more lame excuses as to why he won't appear at commission. not a lot just started LOL that old man is very calculated in his tricks but it will catch up with him and I bet we all cant wait to see the outcome.. I say let him testify on a stretcher. His only valid excuse for not appearing is because he is dead. Seems like Zondo has not heard about Shaik. Zuma will never be well enough to appear if he has his own way. 
1:59:11,2:06:02, commission will have to go to nkandla and work from there to make him testify Remember Mubarak testifying from a bed in his trial - Zuma can do the same. and Mubarak was also very evasive till conviction @Derek Main... Quite frankly I care less if he was dead and in a coffin as long as he testifies and then they can move him to the prison mortuary for cross examination later.hehehehehe @Elvis Malakoane Yes - the Egyptians got tired of the nonsense. When are we SAfns going to get tired of Zuma's BS. @Pastor J True that - he must testify even if he is dead 😂 is a person born a crook or it is something you learn or is it a form of revenge for disfunctional upbringing @Elvis Malakoane I like to think it's learned behaviour but I'm not certain. it's a complex personality nothing of this person is normal or honest 
2:07:47,2:16:02, @Jacob Zuma No true @Jacob Zuma this can not be ignored it affects our country welcome party Nogal "@Jacob Zuma no we are not letting anything go those guys were very racist Guptas bad @Elvis Malakoane Yes - and yet the ANC had no problem with them. Just shows how you can turn a blind eye where money is involved. @redriger Snap! that is why i am peplexed by his psychological state all is wrong around him and his name 
2:20:35,2:23:52, redringer he is pleading insanity which is also demonstration of heartleness @Makwa Choma Spot on! The entire ANC is corrupt. "ANC must pay the price for this You would think the voters are wise enough to see that but the idiots will still vote for the ANC. ANC must account I agreey@ Makwa Choma @make chump..Zuma is using the stolen money to by support from young people. "Derek i dont agree with you there Ypu cant vote for EFF OR DA The NCP @Makwa Choma @Danie Nilsen 
2:23:59,2:26:06, not at all Make a Why must we single out ZUMA bathong "@Makwa Choma Anyone but the ANC - unless you wanted to continue downward with criminals. This commission has shown what the ANC is all about - plunder - nothing more Makwa Choma we make example for future presidents Zuma had power to everything. we cant vote ANC corruption Eff anger DA racisms so what must we do?? "Makwa let us not lose hope Voters need to think beyond party and race. A governments primary purpose is law and order together with management of economy. Who would do that best? Makwa Choma that is my problem 
2:26:07,2:29:12, @Makwa Choma Do you know how many parties registered at the last election? About 50. You have a wide choice. maybe Mashaba party Judge Zondo is too slow! "But if you keep voting for a party that is known to be corrupt to the core viva ANC long live the spirit of Mandela long live. @Peter Sant Mandela's spirit has left the ANC long ago. "Derek Main Even the DA and FF are corrupt; every politician is corrupt "The ""NO CORRUPTION PARTY"" a.k.a NCP was started by the chatters on this forum. Lets all vote for them. hahahahaha" "Mashaba and Maimane are ambulance chasers. They pretend they'll lead by asking ""the people"" how to run the country. Cannot be a real leader by being a follower." 
2:29:35,2:32:28, @Pule Pholoana People who vote for ANY corrupt party are fools. I have no love for the DA. @Derek main. Mandela said himself he will be the ANC even in heaven. We already have President and Vice President. looking for Ministers now @redriger Choice ultimately is between communism(social control) and capitalism(self-control). We need parties to explicitly state where they will take us. Then we can choose. @Peter Sant I guess he never imagined how low they would sink. Pule who is the government in charge and is reliant upon for service delivery? I don't think a sober person can vote for EFF. @Peter Sant Or the ANC. "let's us wait. for Herman Mashaba to start his own political party and vote for him  
2:32:35,2:34:41, @redriger waiting for nominations. You are also on the list "The best option for us South Africans now is to vote for independent candidates Heh @Peter Sant ! EFF is banking on majority of population thinking like a drunkard pastor j am available for treasure post "@derek Main "​The best option for us South Africans now is to vote for independent candidates "Derek and Peter @Peter Sant I'm not stupid enough to be part of the ANC. @Pule Pholoana We need sex education. Far too many school girls end up pregnant. Kids need to know how to control their sexuality. 
2:34:51,2:37:24, Dominic Przybylski ​Heh @Peter Sant ! EFF is banking on majority of population thinking like a drunkard.. There is a growing population of people who believe in a flat earth as well!!!! Who can join that racist DA?? Mashaba for me he is the best choice l love the eff but l disagree with Julius Malema madness to allow the whole Africa to come to our own country "@SONGEZO MNCOKO Of course I do "SURE Derek @SONGEZO MNCOKO So why not give them a chance and then decide? @mgebe Sibula At least two thirds of EFF followers on Twitter are from outside SA. Is EFF's only opportunity to expand. "So is the EFF 
2:37:42,2:39:16, As corrupt as Malema and Shivambu stealing the poor peoples money from VBs This lady did not want to stir things up so she has narrowed her focus so as not to show she turned a blind eye and did not blow the whistle. it's about time and power of persuasion and gain majority true "@Derek main @SONGEZO MNCOKO It's not about persuasion - it's about corruption and feeding at the trough. @EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA ...No chance after what Malema and Shivambu did with the VBS money "Eff student - sjoe another five years of EFF then this country will be totally destroyed "@EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA EFF will destroy the economy in far less than 5 years. There will be nothing left to save after ""giving EFF a chance""." 
2:40:19,2:44:50, Peter Sant very true ANC played a very important role for our freedom But my mother or father has no right to abuse me because of she gave birth to me Well said @Elvis Malakoane "@Derek main "Ayoba EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA give EFF what chance? We are not guinea pigs and our State is not a laboratory. A drop of a beer has all the properties of a beer. Malema and his crew are ANC factory faults. "@Pule "@Derek main "ANC and DA have been tested and failed to masses Even FF+ is better alternative than EFF 
2:45:17,2:48:07, anarchy would be more organised @Peter Sant I voted for UDM but there are many choices - something like 50 parties were registered. Just definitely not a party as corrupt as the ANC. What remorse does EFF have even after Zuma they also stole and are still stealing and informing their members a LOAD OF rubbish @EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA ...have you been drinking something stronger than tea today? The EFF and the thieves who run it will be in jail this year. 2020. guaranteed. The EFF seem to be as corrupt as the ANC. Bev Daniels you people are the cause of all these; all u do is to cause confusion in Africa so that u can steal our resources and enrich Europe and Africa. Our leaders mess Africa with u people. She knew that had she expressed any concerns about the wedding party landing she would have been labeled “racist”! You have a better chance of marrying a donkey and the marriage being recognised in law than the EFF becoming government@EFF STUDENT COMMAND AYOBA "@Derek main 
2:48:07,2:54:09, "@Pule Pholoana ""you people"" Sounds a bit racist to me." @Peter Sant No - I don't go along with those BS quotes. "Pule please ​Bev Daniels you people are the cause of all these; all u do is to cause confusion in Africa so that u can steal our resources and enrich Europe and America. Our leaders mess Africa with u people. @Pule Pholoana Racist much? @Pule Pholoana Did the school bell ring early today? #youpeople #racist @Kevin Aaah - the Ramaphoria argument. He's part of the problem. Where was he while the Guptas and Zuma were plundering? "All we need is to respect the President and TRUST him to do the right thing. If Cyril gets tough on the ANC mafia 
2:54:57,3:01:09, @Kevin NEVER trust a politician. Any politician. There is NOBODY else Derek hahaha...We are limited in choice "Another break what now lunch If you look at the world today...It seems democracy is falling apart. Makes one wonder "Derek Main the disrespect that comes after ""with all due respect"" is the same as the racist remarks that comes after ""I don't wanna sound racist"" and that's what u just did and retract your steps..." "@Pule Pholoana. your right. All whites are preparing to leave SA. They are busy sending their money offshore @Pule Pholoana Please show me where I used either of those phrases. @Pule Pholoana Reciprocating is racism.
