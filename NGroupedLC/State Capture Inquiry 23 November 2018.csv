21:17,48:33, @ Derick definitely they are watching current DG of the National Treasury i think he could be a stand up comic "This witness appears nervous Finance ministry is so important as it regulates state revenue and costing which underpin GDP that is why zuma recklessness is still felt by all of us Why is he talking about WMC?

59:25,1:09:10, ðŸ˜Œ he seems surprised like someone wrote the statement on his behalf. i suspect pravin did this commission can be wrapped in a month. if deputy chief justice can make a ruling that no more political appointees in certain departments. so this guy lied in the draft media statement in order to please the markets...this guy is fishy "all witnesses so far are Anc card carrying members. Mentor "des van rooyen was appointed finance minister for 3 days: i.e from friday to sunday. yet this fool is saying  "uproot political appointees. end of story. they won't be van reopen "on wekend  now the battles of luthuli or conferences are being displayed into national department.
