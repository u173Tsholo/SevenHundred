And Jimmy you always said white monopoly capital ate now its our time to eat  wait a minute where that money will go when they return it Pule and Jan you are talking from experience nyaope boys I doubt his evidence is correct it is very short But he is mentioning reports and exhibits from National Treasury investigation. @Sthakathi Khumalo what other proff suffices in legal terms? blame game as usual 
1:09:12,1:11:04, @makhosi nobhatyi evidence led in legal process isn't about shortness / length but substantive facts. Thato M I hear you but what have we received from aboWilliams and confusions He only fights Mrs Williams maybe because she is a woman "@Sthakathi Khumalo nothing please can somebody explain why these people will come under oath and lie Phumla Williams is corrupt first thing when Jimmy took over ANN7 he said SABC owes ANN7 plz tell us if SABC has finally paid and what was that money for ? @makhosi nobhatyi argue better. When Ms Williams was accusing Manyi of wrong doing did you apply the smae principle? @peter...an oath is just a formality 
1:11:08,1:12:23, He’s seriously lashing back at Phumla Thato M fair enough maybe we could run a public parallel trial now since we have both versions and the other is backed up by some for of documentation ANC don't respect women at all they use them as bullet proof Gigaba is gone no more tourism😁 SABC IS RETRENCHING AND HAVENT PAID U @Khomotso EFF is the same those women in the EFF are cheerleaders of the party "@Peter Staffen ...LOL...REMEMBER SOME OF THEM ARE NOT CHRISTIANS hong hong gigabyte he is gone the rest shall follow loate loate sorry to under oath is is a oath unless it has changed 
1:12:30,1:14:00, @Sthakathi Khumalo Deputy Chief Justice is on record as saying the evidence before isn't convincing and called for more people to come forward.

EFF want state capitalism  SMS please before we finish I want the land back and I'm unapologetic about that Manyi has successfully managed to contain the situation. I think this Inquiry is like cat and mouse. Ms Williams really touched Manyi neh.. emancipation is NOT freedom.. manumition is freedom.. look it up "why is this MS Williams such a liar  listening to guy...everybody was busy with their own dodgy deals and now they all want to point fingers people will sell back the land to these people because they want money and food so the land must be administered by government
