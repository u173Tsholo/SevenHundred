1:15:58,1:16:57, @Mzalwane Mzala we are all guilty of that sin Every tender I've seen has that question that requires a Y/Nanswer "''At that point in time''' gum guard please! that's true @Vincent Nthomang @Peet Venter if one is stupid yes but if you are honest then it is better just to say i was wrong.. In hindsight nature of business? i agree......and shutup 
1:16:58,1:17:26, "@Thembelani Mayoli Director of BNP Capital this man is crazy every tender document has got those question "Grilled Him my brother How did he possibly have been a MBA candidate "I will loose my marbles if this guy says ""HINDSIGHT"" ONE MORE TIME." he is foolish i am from india It’s hard after the fact @Peet Venter. One needs to admit before it’s proven. I guess one has to be mature enough to know they can and can’t do. "Hindsight 
1:17:30,1:18:23, Sorry how could he possibly have been a MBA candidate "how many times has he said ""...in hindsight...""" Thanks okes @funicanz in hindsight me too this is T.K.O he is done for...poor guy No more games Mhlangu @nkululeko you must appear I'll be sending you the rule 3.3 notice lol haibo this guy "@Hermiomie Asreal More like ""blindside""" 
1:18:24,1:19:06, hey yewen what are u saying a couple of MBA candidates I know are like this No wonder why MBA individuals are looking to be employed rather than create employment @Felix Muyoba He definitely falls in the first category. what is your country THIS GUY SHOULD JUST ADMIT THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE he is f888ke "@Mzalwane Mzala "In hindsight I m now going home

1:20:12,1:21:01, ALL THIS CROCKS MUST GO TO JAIL. THEY A LYING TO US just own up "this guy is slowly eating though his bottom lip  Who was helping this guy to answer questions in an MBA exam He must just accept that he messed up It said he has 10 years of experience and he wanted to emphasize that he had more than 10 years of experience. you will never forget the truth mahlangu......o maaka maan @Owen we can start an advocacy to send them one by one "he's got himself into a corner and he doesnt know how to get out 
1:21:06,1:21:40, his counsel was supposed to tell him what to say not talk rubbish MBA ! The problem when lying is that you have to cover lies with lies. The issue comes when you facing a clever person you will make sure he exposes you in such you even confuse yourself can't understand a question Hofmeyr is confusing info requested at RFI and RFQ hindside is th enew work now through the chair If you don't tell the truth...... someone else will. We have to spend time on this until you clarify dude. This is fascinating 
1:21:41,1:22:23, hindsight..did he learn this in his incompleted MBA? I am certain this is where Adv Hofmeyr was going as she earlier asked about that declaration of the accuracy of the info hahahaha Just Aggrizzi and save self embarrassing im blinking FEAR lol His responses mean he has no conscience and understanding of what an oath or the truth is. Who is your handler Mahlangu? Mngadi This day is becoming too long for Mahlangu. 
1:22:28,1:23:06, "I do also feel like he is confused by these questions when going forward you will be in orange overalls. 🤨🤥 "sofia sofia @Yolo More JZ "Way too long Mahlangu in anguish if you lie upon a lie you end up confusing yourself simple really now for the kill

It starts small was this witness subpoenaed or he came voluntarily - literally I love this advocate This is to teach us not to trust anyone... we must have a class action for all this trauma inflicted on us by these thugs He does not have any file all of a sudden 
1:23:35,1:25:00, Cn we move forward Chair lol he should have thought of this when he did this what did his company make "@Granny Mokwena the ""L"" word?" @Sindiswa Moolman Agreed. Same goes for criminals who are brave enough to murder but cant be brave in court and admit their wrongdoing outright "sofia look at her book hahahaha @Pramodpatel Pramodpatel WHAT IS WHAT ? Mahlangu wishes a tsunami can hit park own now😳 is BNP part of RCS group 
1:25:04,1:26:11, why are these guys required to stand throughout the procedings please help Ahahahaha Fake names of fake people I’d bet """Trauma inflicted on us"" this is typical post traumatic apartheid syndrome that we need to heal ourselves from" Yes Owen Nyilika His MBA May Be Excused Mr Fun to move I agree with you Owen OH MY LOL @clive oconnell

Do NOT let other people sign on your behalf "it would be so much better if he just said ""there was a fat juicy tender and we cut corners to try and get it""" @Raymond Fitzgerald No - he works for BNP 
1:39:00,1:39:45, @Wilson Hishono 😂😂😂😂 I doubted if the company still exists I assume operates in Dubai I wonder from which business school is his MBA @Raymond Fitzgerald It is Mr. Masotsha Mngadi who worked fro Nedbank.

"wemame "not BNP 
1:40:14,1:40:31, @Wilson Hishono he got no MBA he couldnt finish a simple question When Miss Hofmeyer grins like that then you must pack your suitcase and report yourself at the nearest SAPS office @Mark Waner Aaah - OK signature he understands but scared to answer @Wilson Hishono ...... from PicknPay That was the death trap: You agree it was false: YES I AGREE....somebody bring the bracelets the suspect is confessing He is looking at Zondo for help lol
