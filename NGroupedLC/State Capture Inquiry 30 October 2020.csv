43:25,48:33, @Salmaan Abrahams .. is chipper today I kinda like how afrikaaners sound when they speak English liewer sal ek dit afskryf @Salmaan Abrahams 😆 Teubes is born and bred Denel. Even his shower mat has a Denel logo @zip reeper and he has long service certificates and a watch at 25 years service @Heather Durr .. if you park in his designated spot there's a disciplinary "@zip reeper​ Hiya @Paul Buchel @zip reeper Lol that happens in every company 
48:59,54:11, "Chair - we do not say it looks like the aircon is noisy I see Malema isn't least bit scared of Zondo. "Morning Every one I have been seeing vids on YouTube of Malema telling Zondo to bring it on. @Goaten - Zondo feels f**** for Malema Malema got balls unlike Zuma. To scare Malema is almost impossible. I respect that guy for his bravery. I must say. Goaten (SB) baiting yourself? 🤣 Malema never said black lawyers were incompetent. He said the black lawyers he hired for some case were incompetent. EFF has high profile black lawyers like Mpofu and the guy with dreads. just like i said (SB) 
54:38,56:29, Yes the “black lawyers he hired ... watch how the troll Goaten baits her self malema a hypocrite big time @Salmaan Abrahams Amen! That is the problem with “revolutionary politicians” They do not practice what they preach. paul GM lets make Sarah Britten work hard between tabs. Just time the posts inbetween users and you will see how they are the same person. Seems like Zondo is the one who is scared of Malema now. Lol was watching a clip were Malema was making fun of Zondo's voice calling it a BARRY WHITE VOICE 😢 The problem with politicians is the people who keep believing them @ Goaten You mean Ngcukaitobi? 
56:30,58:15, Barry white is an all time classic Sad thing is you have a child of colour now and still lose continuously. Malema is preparing his praise sayers for when he has to appear Heather i concur with u . check the interview for Zondos interview for his job malema interviewed him. Zondo gsve hom no respect what is a different between malema and bushiri? Bye Sarah Britten @Goaten - Proof that Zondo is scared of Malema. I'll wait ! @Thanda Sibisi yes that guy... So when a black lawyer makes a mistake the entire law firm is termed incompetent 
58:56,1:01:34, "@Heather Durr well wasn't Zondo supposed to subpoena Malema's bank statements? And now that Malema has said he can go ahead  @ALTA Hi Alta Pastor dagse It was the law firm handling the matter Salmaan. . @Goaten - Zondo said he was CONSIDERING and subpoena's require time and research as to what specifically you want "@Pastor J.J Morning ppl how are we @Heather Durr and we are still waiting. ..Malema said he doesn't even need a lawyer when he appears before this commission. 
1:01:48,1:03:27, kevin GM Does this guy know he is supposed to be throwing all under the bus-I much prefer that lady yesterday Who's on the stand?

1:05:15,1:06:55, @thando cezula always a pleasure @Goaten - Malema's current lawyer has been with him for 10 years and is used when he wants to throw mud and is known to act for people of questionable character Cant wait to see Pravin on the stand...His time is long overdue... 👍 @Pastor J.J @ALTA Hi Alta "HAH 'Hind sight""" yooh missing documents already Jacqui GM pastor there you are😁 
1:07:31,1:10:58, GM committee "@Louis C​ @Heather Durr that is a lawyer's job like duh. They act on behalf of whoever they wish even if it is questionable characters in the eyes of the public. "@lwanda manela ""elethu""" @ALTA Click on Live Chat Dont worry about missing docs. that will never happen ....They just misplaced on other master files. Theres No Way they can disappear. @Mthabiseng Morabe. Pravin is a small fry. I want to hear Zuma explain how he allowed the Guptas to be so powerful not stalling & employing delaying tactics and now i dont have sound nothing @ALTA Het jy gehoor Regter Zondo het n kind by Zuma se skoonsuster🤭🤭

That's his sin! @naidoo Gorfh @Goaten - you mean Malema and the evidence leader Pravin is to be cross-examined by Tom Moyane's lawyer teunis GM @naidoo Gordhan accussed Moyane of advancing the Guptas state capture project @Teunis van Ree Weet jy of dit n wit regsverteenwoordiger is? 
1:19:18,1:21:07, hey @ALTA 🌷🌷 whats happening at zondo now Hello everyone... yesterday there was a part 3 and tsotsi was in the seat... did you guys watch part 3 "Why doesn duduzane zuma will be on your ballot paper as a president of the ANC in 2024. in his own head "@Teunis van Ree  @Rubin Naidoo Pravin implicated Moyane in state capture @Pastor J.J ... where? In the Cape. Coming to Gauteng for Xmas though. What ye up to? @Louis C geen idee

I'm in Snor City hi bro @Pastor J.J anne now i see you 😀😀😘 
1:23:52,1:25:58, @Heather Durr lol ZONDO will also tell you that he was grilled hard by Malema for the deputy chief justice position. @zip reeper I am in Waterfall.Midrand "Hello @ALTA Did you see what happened in court before the start? Someone on this forum just said that Zondo swatted him. "@Rubin Naidoo ... Generally Someone promised to pay for my rent that month. Definately...Malema did grill Zondo. Now tables have turned... @Pastor J.J .. I remember when Halfway House was a cafe and a hotel 
1:26:18,1:29:32, @Goaten - I remember that. Did that person assist you with your rent? teunis ... no what? @Heather Durr no Zondo was owned in that interview. It is simple just type Malema grilled Zondo here on YouTube and you make up your own mind. So Malema want to physically fight DCJ?!! I rest my case 😌 "@zip teepee  @Goaten - its a wonder Zondo got the job @Pastor J.J ... Midrand used to be called Halfway House @Pastor J. J yeah he said he would pay for my rent . I have his email address and he asked me to send him the invoice. @Goaten - and he didnt pay? sad if someone commits and promises and then dissappear 
1:29:40,1:33:17, @Louis C I only remember the Fountains axe man who killed couples smooching in their cars @zip reeper> I hold no brief for “Jamnandas” however I have not heard specific allegations against him other than get the general feel that the EFF and the RET factions of the ANC do not like him. @Thanda Sibisi Jamnadas sent SA over the cliff with his socialist Budgets @Goaten -You see thats not how it works-the witnesses get grilles by specialised x examiners. Zondo listens and enforces the rules.This is tiring. All these Malema puppy dogs hanging on his every word Come on @zip reeper Do you think the Finance Minister presents a budget without Presidential approval? *grilled "@Pastor J.J Protea Hotel now a favourite halfway meeting place. some serious deals hand decisions have been taken there.... not to mention the St George's a few km's further! And maybe even Teazers are we still on a tea break guys Finance minister budget dovetails with the party manifesto 
1:33:18,1:35:02, @Heather Durr lol I am not even Malema's fan but I respect the fact that he got balls and not intimidated by anyone. @zip reeper Panga man I think he was known as @Louis C I know the others and heard of Teasers.hahahahahaha. Thats as much as I would admit Action @Heather Durr Zondo also grills witnesses though. I have seen him do that. @Anne M. Jamnadas was an accomplice @Vuyisani Sikobi Agreed Zondo is constantly belittling Kennedy @Pastor J.J With your hand on the Bible....?🤭🤭🤭🤭 
1:35:08,1:38:25, @zip reeper - no I think he is just trying to assist Adv Kennedy Anyway bye guys. I need to figure out how my rent will be paid this month. Have a lovely day. @Heather Durr Myburgh would not do for Zuma.He is a bit too aggresive in cross examining. Zuma would walk out claiming it is not yet a court of law but a commission. Being disrespectful does not mean one has balls. Nwana a nga kurisiwangi kahle. finish and klar Adv Kennedy is being polite & respectful to the Chair as is required by legal protocol Adv.Zondi is very Brilliant @Thanda Sibisi True. But will a woman work @Heather Durr @Kerry van Schalkwyk Previously Zondo censured Kennedy on his mic position and made remarks about his sight. There's a pattern "Adv. Pretorious SC 
1:38:52,1:42:05, "@zip reeper Correct @Louis C Declined because jy rol in die pitte lang tea break? DCJ is cognisant of the fact that everything has to be recorded properly & I also noticed that Adv Kennedy was speaking softly when reading. DCJ is acknowledging their professional relationship. paula ... no they are back @zip reeper I was assured that my crypto investments could'nt be traced!

1:57:53,2:03:01, Hello @Annie Van Niekerk 😀 Morning Anne M 😘 "@Pastor J.J .. no respect for men of the cloth brakpan pastor hates me so much That Agrizzi magistrate can barely read @zip reeper Do you think he is going to get bail? "Shall we have a quick bet @zip reeper Yes. I say he would get denied bail. "No 
2:03:09,2:05:46, in RSA today you must have a law degree just to go through your normal life. So many people in court for one reason or another. morning.who is this witness "@thabiso mngadi gm @Pastor J.J You're right. the Bench is captured bail denied thank you very much Morning Pastor JJ. I do yes. 😜 @zip reeper Did you know that the Judge is an ex Orlando Pirates player? Agrizzi is a crook and must stand trial like everyone else. The reason why he is not being granted bail is due to him not telling the state of the money he has hidden in Italy. 
2:06:16,2:10:01, @Annie Van Niekerk And I cried a bit thinking that you ignored my greeting @zip reeper True true @Pastor J.J. I didn’t see your greeting. Only that you spoke to me now 🤯 @Annie Van Niekerk You are forgiven bcos you are special "@Samuel Skosana gm Awww thank you so much Pastor J.J. ❤️ I started packing on Wednesday and are taking a small break at the moment Johannesburg High Court Judge Is failing to read Thanks SanF The Agrizzi magistrate is first reading War and Peace 
2:10:02,2:13:39, Morning Samuel @Samuel Skosana always a pleasure "In the Agrizzi matter @zip reeper​ He is stumbling @pastor jj he is a former kaiser chiefs and he used to play with eye glasses @Buyani Mhlongo y He failed his reading at school. Licks his fingers to turn pages @Phakamile Khuzwayo I may be wrong and you right but I am sure that I read that he also played at Pirates. Thanks for the correction @zip reeper Did they give him this job though? Gosh! I like the Judge who is presiding over Aggrizzi's bail hearing.😋 
2:13:40,2:18:45, S A now officially voted the most corrupt country in the world by rating agency Forbes. New Zealand voted the most honest country in the world. No investment ever again for SA annie Love the way the magistrate pronounces cannon-drum annie ... mwah😘 @Yolo More Ratha Mokgotleng @Wilde Patrys A status NZ won't hold for long... too many SA expats now living there! The judge handling Agrizzi's bail application used to play for Kaizer Chiefs in the 70s I suspect Bushiri won't get bail Disgraced former Steinhoff CEO Markus Jooste fined R122 million for insider trading (Fin24) 
2:19:07,2:20:58, Marcus Jooste fined R 125m "Agrizzi: Sorry "That's a start @Mzalwane Mzala . Hopefully @Teunis van Ree let off lightly! "Sorry "so they can fined them. why not fine Molofe @big feet Ratha? @Teunis van Ree Really? I thought his company Steinshof was fined This was only in respect of SMS 
2:21:18,2:25:15, Yes @Thanda Sibisi Ratha Mokgatlheng containing inside information @Thanda Sibisi he used to play with his glasses on "@pastor jj u also correct it's just that I knew him the time he was playing for kaizer chiefs "The agrizzi judge looks ominous Ja nee @Teunis van Ree . That fine is only about insider trading. He still has to answer to more serious charges resulting in the collapse of Steinhof which impacted on pension funds etc. "SIU files court papers to recover R3.8bn from Molefe @Teunis van Ree Y9ure right - Jooste fined R122m August 3 
2:25:51,2:28:27, Agrizzi gets bail Agrizzi granted bail zip ... did he got bail? yes @ALTA teunis thank you State agents would have killed Agrizzi in prison anne thank you i thought they would never grant bail "@Mzalwane Mzala @Pastor J.J We wuz wrong about bail 
2:28:41,2:32:08, I pray that Agrizzi get well and testify against his buddies in corruption. Agrizzi has beeb granted bail Agrizzi can slip onto @Pastor J.J 's yacht for safe passage to the Caribbean @zip reeper I have the booking done already. Pizza and Pasta on the house "Yes DCJ "@ALTA Running away forever Free Agrizzi louis c .... Great 😁😁 My yacht is on the Vaal and I planned to reach the Ocean via the Umgeni River...hahahahahaha 
2:32:49,2:34:37, I am glad he was granted bail. ..he is very ill he must recover to tell us more stories great idea Pastor. On a wing and a pray. pastor😂😂 "That is call ""passing the buck"". No one wants to be the one blamed for approving giving away Denel's core business and R100 millions to VRL." "today's proceedings feel like they have life @Minnib Prince Via Skype.. from Italy @Pastor J.J You're giving away your secret that your yacht is a seaplane in disguise 😉 😂 agrizzi will disappear just like the Gupta's... Unbelievable Let Agrizzi go in peace 
2:34:53,2:36:57, He can go. He started the ball rolling fast. It's hard to stop it now. @Louis C....abba .. the winner takes it all GOTCHA #morning @zip reeper Lets do a bet on Profit Bushiri now "Agrizzi was just a messenger boy.. he was not a big fish.. as a whistleblower elton GM who is this guy "@Pastor J.J ... OK 
2:37:02,2:41:31, @Louis..jokes on u @zip reeper ....shooooooo. The Hawks are on the chat bro Agrizzi is lamped up in luxury trying(faking) his best to avoid JailTime... @Minnib Prince What's funny! ofcuz all of them will be taken to a medical facility instead of prison @Fred Desrosiers True no one wants to be blamed for giving up core business & “donating” R100 million.Obviously some were “under pressure” & others got a cutof the deal . @Louis C ... the gambler count your money @ALTA Vaya con Dias Angelo👋👋👋👋 Just seen Agrizzi granted bail. I hope he returns to this commission before he escapes/dissapears to the wild blue yonder. 
2:42:56,2:48:07, the fact that he is a key witness he will come signing to the onto com louis c ..minnib was giving a song ... the joke's on you by Charlotte Lawrence they will probly try to silence him @ALTA but minnib is out of tune! I am not:virtualhug::virtualhug: "while he is free on bail Agrizzi needs security cameras and heavy protection @Louis C .... ac dc ... money talks ... R1k bet! we wont see Angelo again!!! "I agree @Louis C  
2:48:17,2:50:59, You need to be a bit more specific @Louis C . Due to absconding or ill health? @ALTA I don't like cricket... Anyone with enough money can dissappear. Magic will happen. Abscornding definetly... Anyone can Act Sick! Agrizzi's bail is to the value of his Italian villa "Heartbreaking There's a media scrum at the hospital where Agrizzi is expected to wave from the balcony All bank accounts and investments to be disclosed. Must stay away from all ports of entry. Juniors must be quick in assisting the evidence leader find his way through the documents. 
2:50:59,2:54:01, Louis C ... i dont like cricket ..i luv it @Aubrey D....sad indeed.... "@Teunis van Ree @Aubrey De Bliquy this is the reality of all SA's SOE companies... They were #Captured @Anne M. I suspect the latter.. i think the Italian climate will contribute to a remarkable convalesence! Sad. Imagine the incompetence in governmet blind to the actuality of what they were doing. Maybe they didnt care @Louis C and @Anne M. ...I have a foolproof plan for Agrizzi's recovery.........a Golf membership for Christmas. Worked well for Ole Shabs @Aubrey D....m not really sure they were blind..maybe a few...many were very alert as to the events... 
2:54:32,2:56:21, "What they did to Denel is treason. state arms secrets "@Teunis van Ree quite OK Thanks @Themba Mpumelelo Sibukwana @Nel.....I agree WE paid the guptas to steal all denels documents and trade secrets If I can just give context "this witness is worthless "@Anne M.

"@Pastor J.J 😅😅😅😅 Father  they always want to giv context when they do wrong things. no straight answers @Anne M. Exactly my thoughts.

"Without sounding like a conspiracy theorist "Aubrey The technical guys were honest and great at their jobs. THIS guy had a problem with taking instructions from black people. Yes @Jabu Malinga 
2:59:09,3:01:34, @Anne...but we all know why the golfer was released from prison...no medical reasons Correction - I don't think it was racially motivated @Aubrey De Bliquy "the challenge is we give people prominent positions of trust to manage millions SA had a great arments company.

Was he even married? @Mbuso Ndlovu DCJ had a relationship with a lady whose sister married Zuma years after the relationship ended. Where is this broad base which supposed to benefit from BEE ?? I look at the way these American politicians do corruption and I cringe. They destroyed America too. @Paul Buchel ECG's can also be manipulated.. if at the right price Now they blame China for what they did to tehemselves. 
3:11:30,3:13:32, Zondo was in his 30's when he had this relationship. Zuma was not even in a relationship with her sister. "Becos politicians hav ter finger in all pies revalation on Zondo's personal life was meant to pressure him from pursueing State Capture harder. But many men in SA have love childs. that is no secret. "Do you really think Agrizzi is faking it? He's previously had heart problems.
