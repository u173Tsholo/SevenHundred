1:04:39,1:06:26, Punish the ANC..... Nobody in the ANC has yet been arrested or even suspended The choice between post-colonial corruption and colonial corruption is like asking goats to choose between hyenas and jackals @Magda Seguin noone unless you want to jail everybody Parliament had given the ANC 8 chances to remove Zuma but they protected him while knowing he's corrupt Many corrupt people are still there... Anoj Singh The ANC had 25 years to prove colonists wrong That one is corrupt Anoj Singh 
1:06:34,1:08:22, @Felix I ignore insults.... @Magda....and they screwed it up horribly... And I block those who insult me @Magda Seguin what insults? ANC prides themselves as clean but defend corruption. who forgets Nkandla!!!!!! You can't turn around 400 years in 25 years. Especially if you are eating together with the past beneficiaries of corruption "This corruption is too much. To think we pay so much for everything but others just take away like they are taking vet koekies. This government must just fall @Va.....they were handed this beautiful country on a platter Bra.....and they screwed NNNNNNNNNNNNkannnnnnnnnndla

The ANC puts forward a man like Zuma as their best. seriously? @Lydia Benade people suffer everyday due to inefficiency and state capture but some are stuck to the ANC for life 
1:12:16,1:14:49, state capturing on a Friday... All ANC is corrupt because they defended Zupta in parliament when they should have voted him out or recalled him. They also supported Nkandla with stupid excuses. Am not happy with this gov stealing is not ok nothing to do with race if you steal loose the benefits pay back the money else how must the counyry be run go to jail now it becomes a racial issue @Maria...spot on. @wilson machado vote EFF then "can he just list the case numbers  @Lydia Benade very true @Lydia...spot on

THE BIGGEST MISTAKE IS THE ANC FOR THIS COUNTRY "Honestly Zuma is the principal and the others are his students. let's vote this corruption out and hold our leaders to account. The big mistake is all the people who voted for the anc when zuma was president... they must take responsibility for this mess gd m Mmmm...this bloke sure has the gift of the gab..hey. Paul Mufhadi But that is just a petty argument.. What needs to happen is to vote all of them out!! CR7 and Zuma have been commanding the reigns at ANC for many years. They can't blame one person!!
