23:18,24:30, sorry to be blunt but this clown need to leave pastor j I agree Memela will hopefully be soon in court and Zondo should have disallow her attorney to be further part of the hearing. she is just trying to frustrate @Pastor J 😆 "Last Friday Ms Memela was going to take only 3hrs to finalize her testimony by Monday ms Hofmeyr must be livid now!

They shoudl arrest her now!!! Zondo is having tough time of teaching Ms Memela I think chair and Adv Hoffmeyr are missing the evidence and taking parts that they want to hear say again being sick has nothing to do with telling the truth

40:02,40:41, Crispy fried truth for lunch @bruinman I dont think the chair is a slow thinker you can tell black woman dont scared of white woman like black man scared of white man @bruinman dont be RACIST. Go have lunch "Look at Duduzane zuma for example If Memela was innocent she would have no problem giving crisp answers instead of long narratives full of excuses. "She is either incompetent. or was put in there to loot and steal "Bruinman @ Bruinman you sound like a stinking racist who is craving for apartheid error 
40:47,41:43, exemple even 💰 she forget "You know "How on earth somone with her understanding of procurment put into such a position> ANC deploying loyal cadres Kate Hofmeyr for Public Protector✊✊✊ let's all pretend @bruinman is invisible @Gumede Joseph This woman thinks here 2.8 Million rand house was paid for without corruption... there to loot and steal..... no other reason@Alan White "When you make 2.5 Million well bruinman is ignorant and it shows

42:53,43:47, mhh "Ignore Bruinman "The word ""understanding"" has become an excuse not to tell the truth." WHITE MONOPOLY CAPITAL @Dirk vd Westhuyzen It seems that white monopoly capital is the private sector. on the 2.8 Million for the house she got she should've been taxxed around 650 000-800 000. Corruption money A handful steal millions and the masses stay poor they vote the crooks into government just for a free T shirt and a cap not made in South Africa but in China @Kung Fu Kenny OK i Mommy is behaving today 
43:49,44:48, Hofmeyer was not well prepared for Memela. lets be honest... she should have finished by now. remember DCJ had to ask for extension. Hofmeyer is not doing justice to DCJ @sebili maoatsa Is that the new game? more babble @Phiwe Mkhuzo 👍 waste of our tax paye here and white monopoly are happy now including their deputy judge @Yolo never ignore a bully ..stand up to them..bruinmen is an apartheid canvas rotting to the core @ Dirk vd Westhuyzen ​ white monopoly capital is something that does not exist.

They are connected with high ranked politicians who will never get arrested for corruption. You can blame ANC for the corruption and EFF. 😂😂😂😂😂 this lady Its not only the ANC members that are involved in corruption. Its only because they are in the spot light but its throughout all political organisations. Chair is selling Adv Memela with the answer he proposes "@Umar Singh the $ from USA is also gladly accepted 
49:53,51:32, So what sisi "no issue with tender procedures "@Thabelo Emmanuel Ok "And when White Minority Capital leaves the country umar singh brilliant. @Anthony Frank Malema is a Brakpan Attorney discomfort woman not uncomfort! Lol brakpan "Memela is unfit to hold any crucial position in government 
51:33,53:11, Via Germiston! @Craig Johnson Wy would White Minority Capital leave Craig? "...""IF""one expects the truth from a lawyer...it's the wrong mistake to make. Defense Lawyers know if a person is guilty or not Have you heard of all the businesses leaving the country? @Makhosi she does not work for government anymore as she had to face a disciplinary regarding tender corruption?????? still teething after 25 years "South Africa overall is going down Problem with equating white with capitalism and black with communism is that communism has failed everywhere it has been tried so it gives the impression that blacks will fail everywhere too. "@Craig 
53:18,55:14, @makhosi nobhatyi She is one of a list of many "N-E-w doent matter which way you choose to go it was not me "@Dominic Przybylski Capitalism is no silver bullet either. If it was "@Dominic Przybylski ANC and EFF/BLF are all Marxist far left wing politics She wants to debate each and every question.Wonder why?? is Mommy there? Its called wasting time "@Kung Fu Kenny They say they are 
55:14,56:07, @Kung Fu Kenny Dont call president Ramapoes! No mate @Derek Main It is well understood that capitalism is not a sliver bullet but is the lesser of two evils. "I really don’t understand to be in the helm of the procurement @BeachDude420 Peters ...Mummy had her mouth shut up this morning and is now chained to the desk for the rest of the day @BeachDude420 Peters Mommy must be there for certain. just a tactic when all else fails Actually this kinda people are the ones who let us down "Gerda She is typically @ Norman Zwane 
56:12,56:42, with all her examples "@Dirk vd Westhuyzen Exactly @Dominic Przybylski So I put it to you that we should put our heads together to formulate a new economic model. Neither communism nor capitalism works. exzamples I want Mrs Hoffmeyer to ask me these questions "@Les Modibane He is also corrupted Hey mamela you should learn to listen man!!!!! arguing with the DCJ when bidvest is coming to the commission? 
56:43,57:22, @ Gerda 7 ​ She wants to debate or she is the type of listen to me because I am the expert. She just won't answer questions put to her🤦‍♀️ Does anyone need permission to give this Tannie a running klap. me me me I wish this woman would stop snorting like a pig and use a tissue. This lady is so talkative I am sure she will insist to give keynote address at her own funeral @Thabelo Emmanuel I hope very soon. Overdue as a matter of fact @Pastor J go for it "for someone who specializes in procurement 
57:23,58:06, Permission granted Next phase of corruption is all the tenders that go out to repair everything. Goodbye public servant pensions I have to leave chat and I need a quick blessing imagine the journalists reporting about testimony 🤣🤣🤣 @Andre Gerber Cadre deployment she does not know what it is that she had to know on that position @Derek Main There are many variations between the two boundaries in many countries. There are also completely different concepts like halocracy. I tell you @Jacqui Baumgardt . This Tannies is something else wow now sye has step over by liying to the judge yooooooh ... ill pray for this woman 
58:09,58:56, we need to hear about that corruption of them coz they are looting airport "Why are they implementing EWC section 25 when a form of EWC is already a law? Since 1993 dispossessed farmers could claim their land back You are blessed my friend @Person of interest @Thabelo Emmanuel in my opinion they are behind this idiotic procurement and back hands Person of interest 👍👏 If this is approved. Banks will crumble Maybe the matter will become clear later but it seems to be a trivial point of debate at this point. All bidders were treated the same in this regard. could only be Rob Nel As HOD procurement she did nothing that was required of her post....SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE..... 
59:38,1:00:42, Ineptocracy @Dominic Przybylski I like the sound of halocracy but it sounds more like an organisational system than an economic system. This lady receive a big salary and take no responsibility there come like I mean this lady (ms memela) was not fit to cuppy that position SAAT..she is an incompetent fool.. here she is Someone unchained this woman again ah Mommy hehehe

People steal and hide behind Race @Fana Nkosi True - BEE is being used for corruption by criminals of all colours. This process shows a lack of common sense. Politics. what is she saying 
1:04:58,1:05:24, Debate!!! she will never stand up again @Kung Fu Kenny She'd have to pay me to park there "@wysany ysan True yoooooh confessed CRISP ANSWERS she wants to use BEE as a proxy for looting because the money is stolen political speech 
1:05:46,1:06:40, "she means they did not give me money @Elvis Malakoane ...Do you promise bro that she will not stand up again. And...who unchained her form the desk anyway? @Norman Zwane When you get back to the car it will probably be on bricks with the wheels and rotors stolen """stealing is only wrong when you get caught ""- African proverb" .....Converting Rand to USD for payments is a winner for USA profiteers. Now you get why the outfits DH🤗 @Derek Main BEE is a APARTHEID policy over Minorities. how to give preference to blacks over whites 
1:06:43,1:07:24, Zondo is getting angry....very bad sign if you are in the wrong Hospitals and schools are ZA governments obligation. Not Europeans. Now the white minority capital is cool. Take Take Take @Kung Fu Kenny Here they steal bricks as well BEE is one of the reasons South Africa is falling fast. Pastor j she got scare of her life DCJ made a strong point that people must not clown around @Norman Zwane We ain't safe out here lol! Which part of the question is she answering Airfrance though 🙄 "@Kung Fu Kenny Given our history 
1:07:34,1:08:22, "I have never heard before if it is not bolted down it will be stolen BEE laws should have been changed long ago. Ms Memela is clever enough to know for a fact that it wasn't her fault that her house got paid for out of this beautiful Bee system through DTI!!! "@Derek Main Would you like to know why apartheid happened? I'm not for apartheid she's so concerned about giving back (to who?). She only wants to grab for herself and her buddies "Hand outs @Derek Main She has all the redress cloth on her head She's not remember eish ukuthi 😀😀😀 
1:08:29,1:09:44, @Kung Fu Kenny I think I have an idea - give me your version. She can't remember but even I remember what she said. You stole the 2.5bar @Norman Zwane 🤣 She's stolen all the redress. "@Derek Main Our Khoi and San people of South Africa were the first indigenous She could not steal from Air France thus replaced with a dodgy BEE setup thanks fo history lessons @Kung Fu Kenny Yes... Know that bit "@Derek Main There are literally parts of KZN where the Zulu's killed anyone who got on the territory today known as ""No mans land"". They slaughtered Khoisan." 
1:09:59,1:11:06, BEE = Black Majority Capital = Ill gotten gains @Kung Fu Kenny Not news whats happening here one nation that was not colonized whites all over the world Hey mama stick to your spaza shop "@Derek Main The plan was to divide all races to avoid the Xenophobia and overall war on eachother. But like everything else "previous tenders ""engines"" vs ""components"" How come I can remember but she can't?" @Derek Main we are left with fig leaves whilst the comrades run around with redresses on their heads @Kung Fu Kenny I think that the sanitized version. 
1:11:08,1:12:13, ANC sucks bigtime bam booooom Imagine if a person like Katie was put into the post Memela occupies in SAA.....Nobody will get away with nothing....Pity she is not BEE da the best party then she keeps on being confused checkmate "Anya van Loggerenberg: I saw an official tender result for a government substation here we go ... homerun for the Hof 
1:12:20,1:13:02, she does not She can't answer a straight question. @anya van loggerenberg She is confused when she has painted herself into a corner Running government like running spaza shop really it is a banana republic The Hof🤣🤣🤣 you not confused but embarrassed that you have been caught now act s typically...I am really confused @ siphon.. are you for real or it's diarrhoea Should politicians and all levels of goverrment and SOE officials attend weekly church/religous services once a week and practice what is preached to improve their moral behaviour. 
1:13:08,1:14:54, @Kung Fu Kenny My take is that apartheid officially started in 1948 with the Nats coming to power. Legislated segregation and subjugation. Mrs Hoffmeyr is also losing her cool... getting interesting! 😃 why did whites vote national party cause they approved apartheid "Rory Pro ​Anya van Loggerenber Then you wonder why government can notbuy a laptop at Makro for R10 Apartheid ended a quarter of a cetury ago. old news. Move on @Kung Fu Kenny The colonisers (Dutch & British) had already subjugated the local population and they were consider sub-human. @ craig apartheid is still alive and kicking "No way as a civil servant and a legal professional she is suppose to exclude herself from political objective of service delivery not what race must benefit that is for politicians 
1:14:55,1:16:01, Michael Wild. Are you here? but all benefited whites Just get competent government officials Phillip Cwazibe ...Exactly! Xhosa and Zulu's literally sold their own people to the Brits so they can sell the Xhosa and Zulu people to the U.S as slaves. Did they teach you that in history class? And BEE benefits blacks Much of a muchness just joined so let's get back to subject and respectful chatting on this subject today. trapped 
1:16:03,1:16:47, and whites fronting Guys guys guys @Craig Johnson Of course - blacks were historically locked out of the economy. That is why some form of BEE is necessary. @ craig what's your problem @Craig Johnson thats not true..what about gavin watson at bosasa? Through corrupt government officials Is this the same person who last night undertook to provide CRISP replies? In the back pocket of the ANC hahahaha! 
1:16:49,1:17:41, ask her DCJ lets focus on Memela v Hofmeyer & Zondo Tyhini this chairperson is all over Get her Mr Zondo This is why we should get rid of SOEs where we can because incompetence is sustained by bailouts. In private sector they go out of business if they are incompetent. @ Rory Pro @ anya van loggerenberg I could tell my own stories but not here. you don't know anything about company law or corporate governance kung fu where did you get the informations that xhosa and zulus sold our people we want to compete with u but 150 years of colonization how do we compete cause u are far on the race 
1:17:43,1:18:22, BEE and BBBEE are racist laws. wara wara wara "This lady needs a fat slap - her arrogant attitude. Suprised she and her lawyer not raised ""why shoudl she anwer a white woman questions""" @sipho are you really on this earth...what's your problem wara wara wara wara wara🙄 ha ha "Give that reaseon @Kung Fu Kenny Yes - they are race-based laws because the inequality caused by apartheid was race-based. 
1:18:43,1:19:25, 25 years ago "ziyaad Two wrongs don't make a right. @Derek Main It's a apartheid law in 2020. Should be disbanded. This is the reason South Africa is failing and getting looted. Exactly wara wara wara was probably the most sensible comment she has made this morning LOL Like I mean....wara wara wara........what does she mean? I don't have a strength anymore to debate racial issues because country needs more than just race blame Mantras but the comments are the reason for rejecting the CEO's recommendation 
1:19:31,1:19:54, @Sipho The Xing - agree wara wara wara "here we go again "Phillip Cwazibe ​@ Rory Pro @ anya van loggerenberg: Corruption and Incompetance is such an accepted norm in SA. We're all so used to it people on the chat please stay on this subject. we here for this today. not the worlds issues. you can go to chats related to them. here we are chatting about SAAT and the process around that. respect "Lets say quarter of a century ANC loots South Africa for 25 years. :ANC :Lets play the Apartheid card to avoid prosecution. These people are now happy that SAAis now pennyleas "@Kung Fu Kenny No - SA is failing because we have criminals running our government. I'm still all for people being pulled out of poverty. If that vehicle is BEE 
1:19:58,1:21:03, Normally it BS baffles brains but here it's BS baffles BS! @Sipho... Zuma and Ace Magashule destroyed anc and everything. finish and klaar "Thanks for answering fans sipho is weird HOD of self procurement 😂😂😂😂 "@papzen dont blame Zuma and Ace blame Mandela I like the Chair Man The ANC inherent nice things from the Apartheid regime and failed spectacular in a era with NO SANCTIONS I think BEE has proved to put more people into poverty than it takes out @Derek Main 
1:21:06,1:22:57, "@Rory Pro its true and shocking "@Dominic Przybylski The way it has been run Gini coefficient is higher now than it was in 1993 Ms Memela being a lawyer herself thought she would cruise through the commission yet she didn't anticipate the line of questioning now she's in hot water papa now they switched off the mic's asap Adv Hoffmeyr is struggling........ Why is Adv Memela being asked on questions relating to Board decisions when she was not part of the board? She is being asked unfair questions She is being asked question relating to her statement she gave @Dominic Przybylski I put it to you that that has more to do with the greed of capitalism than with BEE. mandisi ntauzana She is being asked question relating to her statement she gave 
1:23:16,1:25:48, @Dominic Przybylski-so true "Chair must stop this thing of leading answers out of Adv Memela @mandisi ntauzana not if i listen to Chair Zondo @Derek Main Even normal black people agree in the US the BEE (Affirmative action) kills the economy. -@mandisi that is exactly why she is asking Mamela cuz she had her 2c in the board and she made decisions in the board as well if u listened yesterday she was part of some meetings amen Norman !!!! "@mandisa "@mandisi ntauzana No @Nyasha Mudyiwa my brother please note that the HOD of Procurement does not sit in the board where the decision of the parts tender was made. She is HOD correct leading a specific department 
1:26:30,1:28:38, Where does the board get it's information from in order to make a decision? From the HOD. @mandisi scroll up read my comment then ull understand Mandisi yesterday it was made clear she was in the boardroom for the board meetings. Okay thanks "@Maryann Diamond No Adv Memela did not make the decision "I just joined @Norman Zwane LOL please brother what has Adv Memela stolen? we havent heard such evidence here what is on the table? what time are they back 
1:28:46,1:31:21, @Victor Malatji Who are coming back Vic? 5 minutes @Anne M. me and you both agree but the questions relating to the Board of Directors decision to award the tender to JM and not AirFrance are unfair as Adv Memela is not a board member of SAAT @mandisi ... ur comment proves my point that why we are where we are .. dont pick and choose what ull listen to.. Sometimes it seems as if the judge wants to get witness to see certain things. They should just give their version and be held to it later if it was found to be false. Much time will be saved that way "@Michael Wild brother she was in the board meeting to make a presentation on a specific item thank you @nyasha People sitting on all SOE boards are placed there strategically to manipulate the system she oviaaaaaaaaaaaasly lied yoooooooooh ... hence the questions that followed from Kate .. 
1:31:38,1:33:52, @Nyasha Mudyiwa been following precisely....... unfortunately that the cherry picking of evidence and conflating of issues that is what has confused you "@mandisi ntauzana Ms Memela did not want to come to the commission eat ur own words @Mandisi "I'm not saying that Ms Hoffmeyr is perfect "@Norman Zwane brother please amen SABC=ANC we allknow who @Mandisi votes for ANC "...Ms Memela is about to get nailed for her delaying tactics and toying with the Legislature of SA 
1:33:58,1:36:35, @Anne M. that was her decision and for her to be present to the hearing for the past week is also her decision. Has nothing of being part of the board that b=took decision Mandisi try explain to all the people how a stranger gives someone 2.5 million for a deposit on a house. @Michael Wild Non taxed should be added. @Michael Wild its simple @mandisi ntauzana Factually you are incorrect. She planned not to attend until DCJ publicly reminded her it was not an invitation but a subp "@mandisi ntauzana The board decision is one small part in the total evidence. If you are issued with a subpoena amen Anne Amen Norman eastern cape. .. .? Mbotjie is trust land. .. 
1:36:40,1:39:09, "Why is she there with her laywer True where the Tax records. Mandisi as a CEO on a consultancy how does that work. do you need to declare the Tax of 2.5 Mil that was used to buy a house. Cross examination is going to be exciting...Judge is going to loose his s....t with this Memela attorney's even more incompetent attorney. "If you have not done anything wrong "The ""stranger""s bank account is not the person's bank account but from a company (who won a tender despite being the lowest scoring of three) which was used to pay for her house... huge RED FLAG." she said she is a conveyancer attorney.... "@Norman Zwane @Anne M. evidence is not in isolation @Kung Fu Kenny AA & BEE are two very different things. Go ANC @Mandisi.. lol 
1:39:10,1:40:43, Miss Malema looks colourful today. @Michael Wild i'll charge you for consulting on tax...... LOL check the benefit if it was a fringe benefit or a donation to Adv Memela then it was to be declared in her IT12 yes or no answer "mandisi ntauzana evidence is viewed and compared to the statement tyou gave "she needs all the colour  @Derek Main When did i compare the two? Eish guys LOL there is a need for me to prepare for my trip to EC tonight "@Michael Wild Freudian slip? It's Memela "@Derek Main I never compared them 
1:40:46,1:41:56, "I like the orange my mistake "Am not travelling with Adv Memela to EC @Kung Fu Kenny You never compared them - you conflated them. You said BEE(Affirmative action) - as if they are one and the same. Zuma is attending SONA tomorrow👀👀😂😂😂 YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE AS THE HOD woman....ai Have a safe and blessed trip@mandisi ntauzana @Elvis Malakoane Don't know. I don't recall if she said at the beginning of her testimony. @Derek Main The structure of BEE in South Africa started as Affirmative action. 
1:41:57,1:44:35, @Pastor J thanks is he really attending I'm having trouble understanding what exactly this lady's responsibilities were? Yes@John Fagan ...The one who is as sick as a dog @ mandisi ntauzana ​ Where inMount Frere? That was once my home. In town while I was student at Mount Frere High school. 1974-1977 "@Brian Benningfield Not much according to her testimony yesterday. ""I don't micro manage ......""." Mamela salary is considered wasteful expenditure "I'm a proudly South African commercial pilot Craig Johnson why not stolen expenditure 
1:44:44,1:45:37, @Abdul-Aziz Aziz Maybe you just dodged a bullet? "@Derek Main Both are raced based Oh wow......so conflict of interest is relevant to our lovely Ms memela.....what a shock hahaha Crook lol oh Mbanjwa madoda! @Kung Fu Kenny Yes - they are both race-based but they are not the same. This lady just won't stop interrupting mbanjwa doesn't give up😂😂 @Derek Main There are statistics proving BEE put more black people into poverty than helping. Also i never said they are the same. 
1:45:38,1:46:30, i am in charge but follows up on nothing pertaining to a multi million contract "@Derek Main- it might be true but the application of BEE has opened the gate to a very small select group of blacks.the most costly  chiwawa 😂😂😂😂 Ms Mbanjwa is not her day today.... Poor Mbanjwa is going through the mill this morning "AA a handout "@Kung Fu Kenny I'm not going to defend the current form of BEE but I still think redress is necessary. And saying : ""Just move on"" is a cop-out." "@Derek Main You don't seem to grasp the difference between taking a structure of AA and saying ""It's 100% identical to BEE"". BEE is a racist law in South Africa." 😂😂😂😂😂 Meh Mbanjwa bathong 
1:46:34,1:47:49, but she should not know that this and that is for reexamination or not.. "And @Hennie Cloete ​ BEE was not structured correctly. on purpose Phillip! Memela ....our Ms Katie CAN READ.....ai "@Derek Main When you open a business and actually want to do business with the government you have to give up 51% of said company to a black business partner No wander Mercedes and BMW are doing so well in South Africa they steal the money and blow it on German cars "Just say yes or no Lets dispute who carries which title but lets not dispute the evidence 
1:48:05,1:49:20, "@Joe da silva ""White Monopoly Capital"" is a term they use when they buy new Cars lol." but as HOD surely you check up @Kung Fu Kenny Please see my coment above about not defending current BEE. i have been driven to open a bottle of wine already. Adv Memela is not very convincing you have a responsibility and are accountable for your division's performance Kung Fu Kenny ​@Derek Main that is true. The new 51% partner does not even bring sweat equity into the business. It is like leasing ones identity. interesting @Jenny B have one on me 
1:49:21,1:50:57, "@Derek Main This same section of law applied when BEE itself came into existence in South Africa "@Phillip Cwazibe Also the reason why most businesses crash down fast She’s going to faint in 5 minuets @Kung Fu Kenny I support the principle of BEE not the current law or implementation. Capeesh? @Derek Main The current form of BEE is exactly the same just a few of their policies changed to loot further. DOA. Dead on arrival. Lol "@Derek Main I still don't know why though Less work more reward 
1:51:19,1:52:44, "@mandisi  @Kung Fu Kenny Because of past injustices and current inequalities. Suimple. "@ Kung Fu Kenny ​ while not contributing equity she is guilty as sin oh for crying out loud! Innocent until proven guilty BEE is effectively an extra tax more than double company tax and we wonder why we get so little foreign investment or why Anglo American has move everything out they do out of the country. ha ha "she is evasive 
1:52:46,1:53:25, one go😁😁 Yes - no - Not explaining why its yes or no Presumption of innocence in our law. @Kung Fu Kenny Huh!?! No surprise we have such high unemployment. @Derek Main The principle and the structure of BEE should not be supported. This should be interesting Crisp answers "innocent till proven guilty - what a farce 
1:53:47,1:55:12, She takes forever to respond to 1 point. So all 9 at the same time we'll be here until Friday @digitalemotionfilms -agree - any case asks for yes or no answers Thamsanqa Nomayela unless you give a statement under oath like this lady did and then change your version as you go along. Thats called perjury K F Kenny that is not relevant to this chat. please go to the chat dates Before year 1800 stay on subject of today to keep peace and fairness not long rambling obfuscatory explanations @Kung Fu Kenny- I fully agree with you but the BEE scorecard is forcing corporates into bad business practises like paying more for a service that reality! @digitalemotionfilms - she needs to be disbarred as an advocate @Kung Fu Kenny So just pretend apartheid never happened? "@Derek Main Apartheid did happen 
1:55:20,1:55:57, So the likes of AirFrance were also taking advantage of SAA. to convict these people on average need at least 7 years. What about YES or NO doesnt she get Derek and Kung. please get back to subject. What’s the Zulu word for maintenance .?? Is this really an advocate??????????😀😁😂😁😀 @Kung Fu Kenny Of course not - where did I ever say that? @thulani - I hope Air France is listening Yoooooh this lady though.... 
1:55:58,1:56:55, @Mbuso Ndlovu Yes @Mbuso Ndlovu no Our biggest problem is fixating on the past instead of focusing on the future. Result is we are being left behind by the rest of Africa and the world. Lets hope that non of them get in another SOE company ever again. "@Derek Main Demond Tutu himself said ""Blacks lived better under apartheid than they do now under their own people"" #employed. did i miss anything ? The ARABS n WHITE MAN SOLD YOU THESE COLOURED BEADS. There NOT African 🥥 I think - ukulungiswa

Legal frame should be your role mrs Memela as it is your field Ben Cole. Exactly my view. She (like many ANC leaders) fail to understand what accountability means!

"In a traditional court exactly so DESMOND Ok thankyou "at no cost to the state.apart from a shisanyama lunch She seems to be a very capable official in view of the technical questioning.
