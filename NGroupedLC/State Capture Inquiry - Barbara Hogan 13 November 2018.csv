time,0:45,message üòãüçïüçï akuqalise phela lol now Ist that the former president Zuma administration has place many official and Minister's into unbearable situation. Barbra Hogan testimony placed the former president in the helm of stste capture Jacob Zuma is not the architect of state capture. the ANC is the architect. Zuma was just part of it. Julius Malema did not fight corruption. Malema himself is corrupt. Malema was fighting against Zuma because Zuma snubbed them and went with the Gupta's. not because of corruption. "the ANC lol personally i think the Guptas came with positive attributes to South Africa 
1:13,12:07, Hi all - trust people today are interested in the testimony rather their own opinions "The ANC is not on trial here but the ""ruling party is""" "With all due respect all correct wesley for Ramaphosa the ANC is more important then South Africa. He will not tell you that. but look at his moves. "vusi beg to differ But we have not heard anything that even resembles state capture! All the characters so far were government officials and politicians! lol @Thato "Thato their uniform means serious biznis 
13:38,21:38, Morning Thando We need hard evidence. The judge is trained for this. And he is not naive! Julius Malema is the biggest skelm. and I am not white. and I am not a DA member. I am South African. julius will destroy this country with his hate. Its all consuming. "@ Thando @Wesley we do understand you are white that's why you against malema let me tell you we not scared of your whiteness Tumelo dont let your mind be poisoned. let focus on the inquiry n stop talking abt Malema 
22:20,24:42, those who talk abt Malema we know they fear him "No party is clean Who is Malema? i agree with u Noko yamabetlwa üëä lets debate aftr this "South Africa "I am amazed by some of the revelations about the somewhat trusted people of the ANC  @Louis Malema is human being like u @ Andre Malema must just work on his approach because we are stuck in the past and worse The rail deal cost SA 84 billion rand !! 
25:12,30:15, These people are scarvenger of the poor people and the looters are at the freedom of stupidity Noko oh. thanks. people make him sound like he is more than human. "@ Mopho we have to elect President that have qualifications in fact they must submit CV from next year Morning @ Sphiwe Morning and welcome. allah @Louis is just Malema is a straight talker my brother that's y most of people like him "Everyone that wasnt captured was deemed ""incompetent""?" 
30:25,35:11, "The Zuma Cabal and the Guptas yes i am sure you are right Thando but i was just wondering if the deal was worth 84 billion. Indian curry must be delicious... "Noko They speak without fear or favor (even if it is hate speech) Judgement day for the looters as they are exposed!!!!!!!!!!! Is this for entertainment purposes only or will we see some orange overalls for a change? great entertainment @Louis Eloff entertainment 
35:35,38:51, Zuma and Hogan opinions or personality is not the matter but government policies are. Here come the name I was looking for. "For now Expensive entertainment funded by the tax payer. Niel Blomkamp should take a hint and put parliament on the Hollywood map. We can make back all the money Zupta (allegedly) stole. we also need inquiry to question them why they were killing black people Malusi Gigaba .... this will be interesting. True guys & ladies üëç Eff-ers .. court now ordered VBS to be liquidated Zoleka I saw the people who busy with that court case they r not part of community 
38:55,43:52, What‚Äôs the whole point of this inquiry? How many inquiries have we had before? And what happened after? Dune this inquiry is for taking ex President prison in Limpopo to wear orange @NKANYISO BRANDON DUBE showing us how foolish we are as SA citizens that politicians loot while we idolise """State Capture"" is self-explanatory. It is the Capture of a legitimate government by external forces! So far none of that was said here!" "@ Nkanyiso let's hang in there and be positive Noko.. what do you mean ? we hope that this inquiry will lead to charges been laid against 'corrupt' people and the law will take its course. SA is in a recession due to largely state capture and tax payers money stolen. I If you make a pact with 3 out of top 6 you will control the state from there üëç the rest are pawns. i believe this one is different. Judge Zondo appears to be a man of utmost integrity. 
44:05,46:09, There are things that are happening behind closed doors and this commision its tying to revealed all those secrets. "I'm sure not all evidence given about zuma is lies """walk the party line"" = blind loyalty even if it's wrong üëç" Zuma must come and tell what he is and isn't responsible for. Tumelo are you still there? i want to tell you one last thing. Zuma will never appear. "zuma will get off all this stuff @ Thando I stand with you. and if you add more one person then it becomes a total coup. i agree with you @Louis Eloff 
46:20,50:42, LETS CREATE # ZUMATESTIFY #land inquiry Zuma and son will come to testify no matter what. We want to hear their side of the story Zuma will testify gathering the evidence before he rocks up is imperative the more he delays the bigger the risk he is skating on very thin ice. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Seems like when we took over governance. We were not read to govern. Seems to be like a movie scrip that is constantly written by different people. "By the time they get to Court or Investigated "Exactly Lawrence Nkanyiso u r out of order bra we were ready but the mistake was done by electing criminal in power @ Ayanda hahaha ü§£ü§£ü§£ 
51:34,53:13, Jacob Zuma is not the architect of state capture. the ANC is Zuma was only part of the. he just took things to the extreme. where are these white people from Pretoria here. "ZUma is the problem here Tele hahahahaha "I like the way zuma operates want to ask them why are they so racism and poor The problem with this party is that they have hidden personal agenda's "All parties are the same The ANC implemented state capture long before Zuma was president. that's Why the ANC made Zuma president. 
53:21,1:00:26, Fabian I agree with u "then again I don't blame Zuma "zuma is enjoying life in Dubai Mngomezulu true first black people captured by National Party before that's we have President like Zuma "I don't get why would this take 2 years State Capture has always been around it's just that Zuma exposed the reality or its existence "Best you start seeing what the effect of Zuma and the ANC's theft and corruption has on you when there is no money left for water "I praise Zuma for revolting against whiteness what you say is rather racist...if I white person said what you have just said then the cry of racism would be expressed 
1:00:47,1:06:11, "Zuma You could be right Forty Zuma's period in office amounts to a parody of any idea of improvement or a better future for akk all "I look forward to see JZ testifying and what is this trump card? this woman is trying to act like she didn't do anything wrong and i'm sure that she is still lying @ Forty do share the Trump card You are sure how? 
1:06:40,1:10:36, anc the racist part "@ Thapelo she spent the day explaining policies and she held the post for a year because she did not agree to Zuma's bright idea's This lady is very forgetful she knows about braen molefe and how he got there I feel like this country was almost auctioned to the highest bidder do you really want Zuma to come. he is just going to laugh at everybody. "she's not forgetful @ Molly how so? @Mpho because she has to be reminded of some of the stuff shes talking about....but thats just my view 
1:10:41,1:15:45, Think of Ventjie Mento "she's angry cause nobody took her serious Affirm that I am the CEO. Exercise your Auothority. Lol! she is brilliant ramophosa make south forward 0 zuma was ruling people shame then why they kept quiet before things become worse guys The Honourable Judge will make his finding. The Law enforcement authorities will the decide to lay charges the NPA will then decide to prosecute.This will go on for another few years amazing how the innocent remember everything and the guilty remember nothing "this whole thing can be categorized simply this way: kathrada foundation against Fmr president zuma. members of foundation pres motlanthe 
1:16:27,1:25:33, What is Barbra saying..though barbara is crazyi tell you "Khaya Siya Homework was does Jacob mean in biblical terms and he is doing just that. ‚ÄúIt May well be‚Äù! "wilhelm5381 last time i checked kuku had no race...i say that becouse some of her actions i learned about in school Mpho Kgomo..U r definitely right..naturally Jacob o hlokile nnete are we finished now??? üëç @Tamaryn Petersen‚Äãamazing how the innocent remember everything and the guilty remember nothing 
1:25:39,1:39:36, Why would she lie? she did say document and emails were deleted on the Public interprise server "are we still having the state capture FORMER PSD ZUMA MUST SHARE THE SAME JAIL CELL WITH PRAVIN AND CYRIL THANK YOU. Are they on tea break guys?? yes they are Thanks @Chauke Vivian welcome @Wesley Myburgh back on thanks 
1:42:04,1:54:19, @ Chauke Thank you. thy probably has tea. Very funny. Everyone is telling us how bad Zuma was. But all forgot that they were the ones that kept him in Power at each non confidence vote. It shows you the anc is only thinking of themselves. ANC mara hai ANC First then COuntry second... we will vote ANC no matter what Viva ANC Viva uryt i hope they give u a tender Of course you got no brains at all that's why 
1:54:57,1:56:36, "@noko yamebetlwa‚Äã Can't cure stupid "noko you will vote ANC no matter what. not we. you vote for you "im a DA voter  That is the problem in this country. e dont keep them to account Thando Nkutha which party do u think it will bring better change Then you are not a DA voter i vote for South Africa. zuma was arrogant not ANC this people were taking orders from their boss im glad that they now come clean I am ‚Ä¶ I support Trollip 
1:56:52,1:58:39, Kruger. don't even say anything coz u know the story Nonsense they supported him DA mxm mayokunya leyo ANC forever ANC has issues not Ramaphosa hungry Zuma is the one who brought us to this stage not ANC people must understand why swearing now? The whole of the anc supported him they are all guilty this process will be forever 
1:59:24,2:01:47, DA is for white people...ANC is for elite blacks EFF is for all south africans.. not all of them@botha Then who do we keep to account? No EFF for hooligans Can't be Zuma only I never vote for ANC when Zuma comes to power coz feel the rotten rat that time there CIC was pushing agenda we are all numbers net year.. who ever was involved in that corruption i wish Zuma was listening to the mess he has done involving the ANC in this shenanigans 
2:02:10,2:04:27, Nkutha with EFF I m confused coz now they r involved in downfall of VBS n I believe they used the money fund the party Ramaphosa is the ANC's president not the people's. if he was the people's president he would have done away with the rotten apples in the ANC already. "Is South Africa dying a slow death c@gladwell i think everyone is watching We don't need nice guys. We need a President who can take charge Yes he is the ANC President but he has power Brother ka Floyd baba Thandi Nkutha Shibamvu is included thee bra next year must have that 1994 feeling..a new beginning for south Africa..Total revolution change is imminent. ANC is the problem for South Africa 
2:05:02,2:07:41, not at all.. EFF will get its nice 10% on polls this will lead us taking power to the wrong people n we will regret What was the involvement of malusi gigaba in this? Jacob Zuma is to stupid to be a State capture architect. the ANC is the state capture architect. the Zuma only exploited what was already in progress. we cant gamble on The ANC they have already put this country in debt 9years of Zuma was just eat and dont ask.... true at Nkutha we r waiting for the full evidence "Racism extends across all political parties  "Barbara.. Barbara 
2:08:10,2:09:41, true Thato Lekoma u r EFF neh n very same leader of urs is the one cause this by killing for Zuma the fact he didn't get what he wanted he ran away The DA must also testified maybe Mmusi is involved somehow who knows? People which party has potential. @Thando Nkutha EFF is for black only the only thing that they really reject is white supremacy none hahaha ANC Thando Nkutha bullshit ANC 
2:09:58,2:13:18, Really this is depressing honestly seriously @Peter staffen pls reduce ur temperature brother There is no need of change of party in SA.. people should go to the ground and just fix the country @ Noko you are really not for the white community. we don't need this magowa to come back to power pls "noko yamebetlwa why must i @Mpho Kgomo they r also not in black community dear I say make the Magowa clean up vote them in for 5 years then remove them after the spring cleaning and put ANC back just hire them for cleaning we will take it from there.

All will be exposed Trump is a racist cabbage Poor Thando. Dont let there red overalls fool you vote ANC gus it is changing I dont care about trump. We need to fix our country first before looking at ather countries he looked like a true cabbage on Saturday ahhaha 
2:19:28,2:25:26, @ Botha let Thando falls in the blue T shirt fool him "In order to fix our country  It‚Äôs about time we vote for policies not faces. "The problem with firing people is that Don't agree we need to come together and stop fighting each other. this country still have lot of apartheid it won't be fixed unless Mlungu can com stays in loxion We wont find peace if the politicians keep opening the wounds of apartheid. apartheid whats that? As long as there are policy inconsistencies we are not going forward eg some are saying e-tolls must be stopped while others say they must continue. 
2:25:58,2:29:34, We forgot the anc ruled for 25 years. pointing fingers doesnt help either i don't want to be reminded of apartheid pls "Ryk Botha agreed Mr Botha yes 25 years sir what r u thinking now which party can we give I don't care who rules the country. I just hope that no party ever will have a two thirds majority. It seems like we cannot handle the power of responsibility Ramaphosa will answer your wishes @Ryk Botha Thando EFF I agree with u lets wait for CR to testify it then that we can decide

He must have had a lot of support @ van zyl I want to be your brother in law the problem is that they don't forget what happened to them before that's why they think white hate black 
2:36:36,2:41:08, Well it isn't a myth but to say that ALL whites hate blacks in completely false! conundrums of reprehensible complex. I took the blind test but still don't lure through specs. Moshakga hahahahahha u got them now take it easy on us brother @moegammat africa eish and that unity is just the remedy we need moshakga you got a smile out of me This guys they must give Juju their sister yellow bones then he will like them Thato I think you coming across as arrogrant very and racist as well
