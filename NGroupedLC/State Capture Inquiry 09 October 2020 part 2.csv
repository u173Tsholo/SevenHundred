Masuku has been found controversial with the PFMA and the premier discharged him from the office and now? I can't get enough of the DCJ just flat out laughing that time🤣🤣 As a Judge he should have known he is illegally appointed by Mogoeng.Constitution Law clearly states only a President appoints a Commissioner ? He is a hired gun .

23:33,24:37, yes @Abram "Jozi now is dead "Angelo it will help if Zuma's appearance is virtual to avoid his lawyers's theatrical acts mokdai they paid They were just ordering him around question to the room - is it correct to refer to Jacob Zuma as President Zuma or should be reffered to as Former President Zuma? who is going to question uBaba ? 
24:39,25:30, @Hlagala they will mute DCJ 🤣 who cN say no to money for just striking "Angelo Doubel I don't think he will succeed because DCJ is seconded from apex court I don't support this virtual thing Zupta prisoner @Russia Magezi for sure. he thinks he is above the law. Zuma must just testify and clear all this issues and save time and our money @Elvis Malakoane Not Appealable "when questions gets hot 
25:32,26:59, I have noticed many government ppl refer to him still as president? "After this commission DCJ can start his own political party and have all the Adv's as ministers  Zupta must fall Tronkvoël "It looks like ANC is now trying to consolidate it's power and push back Uphi uZuma?
