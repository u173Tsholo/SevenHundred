Which i guess is the whole rub. this witness must never come back again never @Diana it is proving that now that all bailouts are just to make sure that everybody is getting his/her share @Mbuso Ndlovu - this commission is preparing the crooks for the bigger picture. You saw what happened to Edwin Sodi and co! Be petient and you'll see the big boys like Ace Mahashule etc. being exposed @gala lol

He probably regrets his decision ANC's crazy socialism finally caught up with them - now they're skint babette ..they said 25minutes @Ntsikelelo Vani Hodes is known for being seedy and sleazy and acting for shady clients-its easy to get a guy to contradict himself on a blurred video where you put words in his mouth. is it tea or a skaap braai? 
1:51:08,1:52:43, @Ntsikelelo Vani U was watching. That lawyer is a shark.

2:02:46,2:06:14, Discount attorney zondo is very strict shame Has anyone noiticed zero credible evidence for the corona scam? They could have doine this any year they chose.

Obviously and totally choreographed and 80% BVLL$#1T ...but I'm not a Scientist 🤷🏽‍♂️ @Aubrey De Bliquy So what did my sister die of "@ALTA I am embarrassed I must i find the lead evidence leader to be very very efficient. This is how it should be done. Not to go through obvious stupid non-value adding stuff. 
2:09:13,2:16:03, xolani... dont worry it happens to all of us @Heathe please dont give me that lame anecdotal BS. I love you and care about your loss of a sister. She could have died of the flu or covid complications. Why you so keen to endorse a scam? ...but also about 85% match to swine flu symptoms... 🤔 To my knowledge this alleged virus has not yet been identified and nobody has ever therefore been proven to have died from it. @Aubrey De Bliquy dont go confirming your fascination with conspiracy theories and dont underestimate my ability to identify facts that are scientifically proven "@Aubrey De Bliquy Its a mostly asymptomatic pandemic dude. Not hard to get. Im not commenting on our response to it "Aubrey is also right. science is based on facts @Heather Durr Yeterday you proved you spent your time trying to learn Latin at university but do not know Memorandi is the plural of Memorandum.

He knew Denel was captured when curry appeared on the canteen menu bickering can be fun and eblightening. Whys should the devl get all the coverage.? DCJ is determined t o have his lunch 🙂 Lyttelton blue collar paradise a trainee appie.. at least hes honest I thought he looks like that guy who rode into Ventersdorp on his Horse-Piet someone Thats why Denel is bankrupt now 
2:25:05,2:29:43, As a ICU nurse can I just ask that all those who believe covid to be a scam make a living will refusing treatment from this imaginary illness then no one has to risk their lives to treat you "@Jenny Whitewaves​ @Jenny Whitewaves Thank you for all you do I never laughed so much since my mother in law fell off the bus with arms full of plate glass dishes.
