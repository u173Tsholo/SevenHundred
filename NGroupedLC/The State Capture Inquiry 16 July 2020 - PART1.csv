1:23:23,1:30:07, bribed Agree @ Adrian. Was it intentional or unintentional? Blatant omission in not listing irregularities in the audit report. Did management accept that irregularities were present? Agree @ Marcus its a disgrace for other auditors! the report is was priced "the rot knows no boundaries listen NO REMORSE eix I find it hard to understand this guy 
1:31:48,1:35:38, yoooo this guy is lying through his teeth!!! How can auditors be selective of samples when auditing of discrepancies? What about the horrendous FARM MURDERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!We need media to show the world what psychotic freaks are doing!!!!!!!!!! Were the missing files reported in audit report? "this guys is not revealing the whole truth instead he is giving criteria of his own work  He will try to duck and dive but this woman will not leave him alone you are right Mr TQt morning i agree with Tshepiso he is not telling the whole truth 
1:36:13,1:37:35, lol the Judge/ Chair is Clever catching the auditor! corruption at PwC white company caught out. uhmmmmm not only black companies are corrupt "..Auditors are employees He does not know what dereliction of duty means or he's scared to concede Mr. Mothibe is busted. He didn't do his job propoerly. PwC captured by dudu myeni 
1:37:43,1:41:10, @Sal Abdulla He is just scared to concede that he messed up. Dereliction omission same difference never trust auditors with yo money Shem...this guy must just tell the truth because he is just trying to run away... Dereliction of duty presupposes gross neglect whereas an omission might be without a blame worthy state of mind. this guy doesn't even believe his own words @Nqobane Mzizi he deliberately messed up for a gain. He got brown envelope not mis leading but lied. @Theodore John he is BUSTED! I wonder if SAICA and IRBA will deal with him accordingly. 
1:41:59,2:11:30, They probably will. He was never ready lol "Let's pick it up after tea They cost the taxpayer billions - must also face the full might of the law - ie prison "mr mothibe is giving all the meanings of every word thrown on him but i believe this lady is coming alright  Not much of an audit by PWC. They seem to have been afraid to chalenge the SAA board! Lol he caught and finally admits his statement is incorrect! who's this guy? """ADV. HOFMEYER-MISTER MOTHIBE ' WE R GOING NOWHERE SLOWLY""" "I am not sure if the question posed to the auditor is for him to answer. Yes 
2:16:39,2:23:53, I't's like watching Paint Dry "To what extent does Mothibe or PWC have control/influence on the ""purported unlawful extension"" of the work? Standard practice or experience points to 5 years. I don't get why he is being cornered. ðŸ¤·" Yey we have sound today..i thought they stole the mics It is not as if PWC or Nkonki forced the audit down SAA's throat. "This question must go to SAA's supply chain management. More importantly He went against what was on paper. Meaning the 1 year period indicated on paper was just a sham ðŸ˜³ In essence he took part in misleading the public so as to enrich himself. Now he is blaming it on trade usage. ðŸ˜³ðŸ™ˆ 
2:24:26,2:30:52, What is wrong with this guy. This guy canâ€™t answer the questions talking in riddles He is having trouble with comprehension. Acting dom "who is this guy the guy not prepared fo inquiry No he didn't misunderstand the question. He's playing dumb PWC auditing team is a big problem? dont trust auditing firm's pls 
2:31:21,2:48:36, I wonder what his job was 10 years ago and what his qualifications are? But why didn't the firm send someone who was there from the beginning of this contract? getting a tender is like winning the LOTTO in SA """ HEY @ PHELADI LAMOLA@HE IS BEEN THROWN UNDER DE BUS OR THEY HAVE RESIGNED""" "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux that is true You trust her after she has roasted you so much. You're gullible. Hahahahahaaaa @Mzizi. he knows that she is right lol Are they auditing the sound now? @Jean Pierre I can agree with you when they get tender they think they won lottery 
2:54:40,3:03:15, " "There must have been some kind of guarantee or assurance done off the record " PWC were threaten if they not cooparate they will be thrown out.. that is why the letter says one year "Whats are with the commission lighting room """ CONTRACT 4 ONE (1) YEAR Had just join now is this from Prasa official Can we get the PWC and Nkonki partners who signed off those AFS to testify? Will SAICA ever take action against those involved ? 
3:04:13,3:17:25, Is this on Dstv? If it is please what channel ? @Joshua Borias They did work for 5 years. That is not the dispute. The matter is that it is irregular (outside contract). """ THE HEAD-OFFICES OF COMPANIES LIKE PWC IS OVERSEAS """ NQOBANI MZIZI This guy is fumbling he's cracking under pressure this guy "He is cracking indeed @mkm 23. I feel for him shame. With great reward (pay) comes greater responsibility He stutter when he is in a corner! """LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS A JOINT AUDIT THRESHHOLD BETWEEN PWC & KWINANA AND ASSOCIATES""!!!"
