time,3:52,message ZUMA is coming! More? Ek dog dis eers in Julie? "But at this stage we don't know if he will actually testify. According to his lawyers hello and welcome guys hola guys Hello Jayden another dae of shocking news.. @Abel am with you on that one 
5:07,11:51, Zondo just wants this Adv to wrap up another day of exposure of blatant theft ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ True I am going to listen to parliament #sona debate That debate is a boring exercise @Anne M. I thought the rule that has been applied thus far is that you cannot cross-examine witnesses until you have testified yourself. From there @Granny Mokwena #ProudlyBroughtToYouByTheANC 
12:09,18:27, "@Derek Main Yes this debate is boring very very boring.. You may cross examine but you must have submitted your own version in the form of an affidavit Zondo has more questions for Adv than the witness loooooooool ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ Zondo must wake up how can he work up when he is confronted with a sleeping tablet this early lolololo 
18:46,29:35, ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ even the SONA debate is better than these two.. its like shes not sure of what she is reading.. @Mduduzi Thabede Aaah OK - thanks. @Mduduzi Thabede It's going to have to be a very long affidavit. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ Absolutely but is that fuel for the whole Tambo fleet or just for two in question....this is not clear "the Nigerian President is reserving jobs for them at home 
34:43,42:44, she must be able to stand on her own feet the commission does not want to waste resources where did the Guptas.park there airplane and where did it get refilled. It got chased to OR @Michael Wild morning michael @wild the aircraft landed at Lanseria if not mistaken. @Robert Russell People will say you're xeno... "to my knowledge oh yes you are right "@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU .... read the old testament.... """"Eye for a eye"""" call me what you like." 
43:21,52:32, The plane they used for business that was grounded by the Canadian company. it was used by Zuma and others to travel to Dubai. but guess Lanseria was a better located site. but was fuel diverted ya neh I wonder whose job it is to prepare all this paperwork... "@Robert Russell But i always found it hypocritical when any citizens complain about Nigerians on drugs Chairman is correct. It is frustrating that the evidence leader dies not allow the witness to tell the story behind the facts and only reference the facts when necessary. "the whole thing is flat This is better... patience when you punch the body the head will eventually give in. Zuma's lawyers are accusing the Zondo comm of impartiality a grave concern according to me and is vague on whether he will appear on the set dates before the comm 
54:52,1:03:51, Zuma carries too much baggage his cross exam requires mmore than a week Interesting to see how the Zondo cmm will respond to Zuma's letter on how he view the comm among others that the comm is prejudiced against him. I saw an EWN report this morning saying he was heeding the call to appear at the commision Always the VICTIM @Nelson Musoliwa "IMHO Jayden you are right a week is not enough "He needs to face reality Zuma always play smart with law crying victim hood "waits of time no one will be arrestesd at the end 
1:05:45,1:15:18, Too much """I will kill for Zuma""" "He really is not worth dying for "Zuma is a spent force we better not have this advocate again after tea please s0 much respect for DCJ ZONDO Why are they rising though...it's not a courtroom "@Jayden Bango Zuma was a whirlwind that left our defences all flattened out "Zuma won't testify 
1:15:24,1:31:08, He is a Judge and you respect him for that Role @Jayden Bango We are so fractured we cannot even see a crook on two legs. Yesterday we still had bus loads of Zandile Gumede supporters just as we had taxi loads of Magashule haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa wake up haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa s@Jayden Bango All these are people who cannot exposure of their leadership or fools who are hungry to be bought for whatever purpose. That is what I guess the zuma years left us with. jai sri ram.. @Norman Zwane the biggest legacy amongst all predecessors will be corruption.Never in the history of SA has an economy be so wrecked by one individual's blessings Sorry i am late guys... coming from parliament this is one of the best lawyers Woza Mark Vhaun... your name sound corrupt 
1:31:45,1:35:38, @Siyabonga Kundayi you didnt miss much. u have just joined the right time Jayden you just like Adv. Hofmeyer lo lol sdhe argues well "Yeah her mental faculties are well chiselled wow South Africa in the making........ 
1:36:20,1:39:51, "@Hermiomie Asreal Thats her name "Is it my ignorance or something I couldnt have put it better Norman "Oops Buthelezi performance is quite dismal to say the least I only know her as Advocate Hofmeyr "@Norman Zwane  The top guns are busy elswehere across the country and the continent @Jayden Bango Next Zuma and Jimmy Manyi will insist they will give evidence if only cross examined by Ms Buthelezi. 
1:40:05,1:44:05, "Tough this one loooooool Maybe your favs will be back when Zuma appears i think zuma can present a better defense than the lousy Jimmy @Norman Zwane Zuma must be examined by Ms September @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Why? Will he be distracted? @Mr Jones Parker Why is Pretorius not in the house? Zuma got off the rape rap coz poor prosecution and I have nightmares of a repeat. @Norman Zwane I think he is busy preparing or something. But he is definitely the team leader. He is probably the one delegating who is to question who. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Present counsel is like Tabasco - very sharp bite in small doses 
1:44:22,1:51:19, you are right about delegation Parker @Mr Jones Parker Very comforting thought indeed. @Anne M. He will keep on licking his lips and trap himself "@Norman Zwane  Thanx @Jayden Bango "@Norman Zwane Very sharp jeez. I am sure those she dealt with yesterday and before "I find the use of the word ""SYMPATHY"" in this context very patronizing." @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU ðŸ˜‚ Maybe Ms September should sit next to Pretorius / Maleka while they ask the questions? @Anne M. I dont thinik so. they must be restricted to lower courts and processes until they can get their act together we cant manage to waiste taxpayer money. this commission is already behind trime 
1:51:45,1:54:43, @Anne M. LOL...WHY not Ms September? "@Anne M. when ""Black empowerment"" started in the late 70's the ""sit by Louisa"" kind of training was used. It did not wark for me coz it was the first time I sat next to a white female." I pray that Maleka is the evidence leader for Zuma. Heâ€™s brilliant . looooooooool @Jayden Bango The advocates I am referring to are senior counsel who have been excellent in this commission "I think your criticisms are too harsh "this is the most important commission in recent history @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I think she will be intimidated by JZ. hofmeyr and maleka the impressive ones 
1:54:58,1:57:11, I haven't seen the commissions bae in a while... ðŸ¤”think her name is Refileo or something sorry to dissappoint but JZ aint gonna come here "@Anne M. wHO's this one? She is sharp! Its boring "@Anne M. It was either me smelling her intoxicaring perfume "I said it before that they can't throw interns to our faces. This is a big stage this is hofmeyr Boeta @cassim suleman this one's name is Hofmeyer? She is sharp! Thanks for name. "@cassim suleman  @Yolo More thanks for appreciating my point too...this is not about being too harsh on them 
1:57:58,2:00:58, but she slipped up yesterday..she did not implicate the banks and sbv for defaulting on fica duties remember the focus is on aviation "Ms Hofmeyr and a couple of others kalandra viljoen...money laundering ..500m a month Me too Maleka is perfect for asking Butternut head @Ashne Hesselberg Maleka perhaps on leave and attending into his own business? Its unlikely Maleka will be here again after this long absence.... i suspect. Pretorious might be the one! Jayden Bango..all implicated are informed to defend themself @Anne M. Oh i assumed but one never knows @cassim suleman kalandra aviation link was that lady's company at mafikeng airport 
2:01:01,2:04:18, "No Anne M Hofmeyer was biting hard the money launders yesterday @Anne M. Anne M.full time or part time..glaring that banks and sbv were in her definition of enablers "@Yolo More Can't find Hofmeyer on that website... Only Maleka "@Zanele Dayile Maleka is like a WASABI @Norman Zwane LOL "@Yolo More If you are correct "DCJ said in March 2018 ""Advocates and attorneys will be brought onto the legal team as the investigation requires""" "Thing is 
2:04:57,2:07:38, ha ha @Anne M. Makes sense Anne. Those are temp additional adv to support the permanent What is the correct position in whether AA and BBBEE increased job creation than decreasing job creation? "@cassim suleman Some of the banks ""hands"" aren't clean." "The original Advocates are: Pretorius @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Most Zebras have that toothy smile of a crocodile as the last view before they get eaten. i would like to see Adv Maleka tale on Zuma. https://www.sastatecapture.org.za/site/about/legalteam I am sure it is because those are the only ones who were with DCJ on his first press conference. 
2:08:29,2:12:38, Anne M ..yes in this case bank manager did not need to be a rocket genius. @Lorna Kavanagh Jimmy Manyi cried like a babe in arms even before the 1st question from Adv. Maleka. He was terrified my that 'GOTCHA' smile on Adv. Maleka's face. So AA and BEE is a failure and who then is responsible @Lorna Kavanagh I think Zuma would wet his Mshini wam Gerrie Nel vsButternut headðŸ˜‚ Thank you very nice. ðŸ˜‚ They should have rather had a knowledge base training. where the people with the correct skills teach others and transfer the knowledge over time. dont just remove and replace ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€cut and paste What is going on here? 
2:16:16,2:54:55, Someone says the Vaughan sounds crook(rish). Let me leave for Sona Debate for now. @Jordan Strudwick I believe this guy is some fuel management expert at SAA Zuma is wasting our time "Zuma told high school students that there is no state capture He is coming in July to tell us there is no state capture in South Africa "We a Here Because of Mr MALEMA "@Norman Zwane Gcabashe is an old croc with many tricks Owen correct "@Owen Nyilika ""We're prepared 
2:56:28,3:55:22, @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I don't think Norman is a Zuma appointee - didn't DCJ selected the advocates he wanted on the commission. Owen nyikila I think you left out the millions of South African who voted him to power. Zuma is a Coward to all ordinary Blacks "@Anne M. Eff complained last year that Norman was a Zuma appointee in the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) "@ann So Empowerment (regardless of race) is based on individual effort. i.e. self-empowerment. Anything else is a farce and an open invitation to corruption. "800 million litres of fuel per annum instead of the normal 442 000 per annum was used and there was no procurement whose this guy where he is working 
3:56:50,4:12:00, @Mulunghisi Mulunghisi Vaughn - SAA position of the guy Head of Fuel Management it is my phone have a problem of the sound @Mulunghisi Mulunghisi Do you have earphones? Sound is okay on my PC. welcome back guys how was lunch @anne yes maybe network v4 Remember the Guptas had a plane...but I'm speculating 
4:12:51,4:17:42, Estelle Loocks testimony was different "I spoke to Exon executive in apartheid days and asked why he wasn't doing business in SA. His answer was that in rest of Africa they could do what they like if they pay bribes "Something fishy going on here Dominic it is the same with pharma companies capitalism sucks African governments do not put experts in their fields in governments hence you see eg Mbaks going from sport to transport "Is all part of becoming a standard African country where corruption rules - ""decolonisation""" neo colonialism! Africa is a lawless contintent. 
4:17:42,4:28:38, "Having worked with government bodies in SA Mboweni put checks and saving measures for the municipalities in place now they are complaining that they cant use consultants.They dont do the work they are employed for. "what about that German company on the arms deal. Corruption cuts across most countries even in Europe I was friendly with a PAC member just after they were unbanned. He had a whole lot of Nigerian friends who became directors in all the big companies based on BEE. Local blacks were too slow. what does speaking over someone whoi has not finished show. yesterday we had a lot of it from Viljoen who constatntly distracted the judge Perspective of morality is very different between Europe and Africa. European morality is based on merit. African morality based on benifitting family/tribe/race ahead of merit. They use voice typing @Jayden Bango "..Denel SOC/ Weapons Ind. is a pivotal for turnaround funds DP...you certainly have no idea what you are on about. 
4:29:29,4:32:57, who is this guy..? did he ask not to be shown on camera..? its your lazy engineers again @DJ DJ dream on. aint gonna hapoen @DJ DJ He'll find a way to avoid it. Sudden illness is my guess. Lol guys. He does make me laugh requesting questions prior to coming to inquiry allready his laywers are saying that this commission is design to make him look bad Zuma has to appear because the buck stopped with him as the person accounting to the voters. By the way he took an oath. Yip JZ and DD on the same Poisoning bullshit story.... @Dominic Przybylski 
4:33:22,4:39:18, Oath means nothing to JZ Zuma is key to this commission of enquiry. He will be supeoned should he not volunteer to appear. The evidence leader must be Mr Pretoria or Ms Hoffmeyer . Pretorius "Hello friends You have to put Maleka into the mix..... "If he does appear I expect him to refuse to answer questions The sad thing is that we are going to pay for his legal council in this commission Zuma wanted the questions so he could learn to answer in parrot fashion We paying pension for him and his 5 wives at nearly same amount as when he was president. 
4:40:34,4:44:33, for this commission he is..... the Presidency confirmed this on Monday Exactly the point Dominic. And he can't get by on that. I can't wait to see Zuma sweat ðŸ˜… "@ Born free yes he trying to sabotage commission as if he is corporate where he seems escaping Is why he eventually gave up presidency. Alternative was impeachment where he would lose his pension and continuing perks. "... Zuma... President of the Corporation of Countries/ States Surely if Zuma is found guilty in a court of law all his perks will fall away?? Not sure @Born free. Depends if/what he is found guilty of. "@ Domini Przybylski the old he still thinks he is a president or he will be a president in near future 
4:44:45,4:47:23, He should be charged with TREASON Guptas taught him and Dudu Myeni how to hide evidence by never putting anything in writing. Can Zuma write??? RSA economy almost as damaged as those countries at war. Horrific. @Dominic Przybylski ..... no writing is a ANC tactic... taught to them by the Russians bye bye guys. it wasnt much fun today Wow I wish my day at work ended whenever He was trained by KGB Bye bye..
