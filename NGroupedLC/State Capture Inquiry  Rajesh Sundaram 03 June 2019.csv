1:43:44,1:47:54, 🤦Just popping in to say hello to my dear Brother @ KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU 👋 @piet agreed Keith 100% @makhosi nobhatyi Zuma economics were about involving business chaps to loot. Mbekis was to involve business leaders to employ citizens and help grow the economy. Brother Rajesh Mbeki is an economics graduate from Sussex University @Caron Hill Wow. Thought you've decided to be offline totally. Glad to chat with again... Are you goog? correct Keith. The country was moving forward under mbeki. Now its currently a basket case with hatred everywhere "@ Keith S. Dinabantu 😃😃😃 we must protect the sitting president 
1:47:59,1:50:06, "@Magda Seguin Yeah anyway All the politicians who pushed for Mbeki to be ousted and went to Polokwane to have Zuma instated as president are all complicit in his theft including supporting him for 9 years @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU give us scoops bru And Malema was the most vocal in support of Zuma @makhosi nobhatyi 😂😂 I always maintained @Magda Seguin .. Spot on! because he is the biggest puppet Julius “flip flop” Malema "Zuma taught Malema well 
1:50:08,1:52:20, "Zuma last week said he is clean @Magda Seguin I think Zuma courts everyone in surprise coz they didn’t expect this to happen but were given him to much space to do whatever he wants so were too scared "EFF is in serious financial trouble @makhosi nobhatyi Hence he never pitched up on his inauguration right? Who trusts what Malema says? the man praised zuma for years and claimed his blood is blue and green and how he will never form a political party against the anc 😂😂 who can trust that? And another R109k for Afriforum @Magda the EFF took it on review. More costs lol. Malema is funding FF-PLUS and AfriForum Malema's mouth was always gonna get him into trouble... 
1:52:30,1:54:26, EFF assets were seized right? Leave juju alone and talk about what we hearing here "Lol. It has never been possible that 1 manis more guilty than others. Im interested to see all names @Simon Davies Big reckless mouth indeed! Was expecting more of trouble than the existing for Malema. News reports said over the weekend they have until Friday this week to pay Afriforum else they will seize assetts "@Keith S.Dinabantu he read everything old man knows that going there is like supporting Ramaphosa "Sipho @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU The EFF has until Friday "Fact is 
1:55:24,1:57:02, Myself too Keith. But there's much more coming for this clown And then the PP closes the Estina case and says she found nothing wrong "They are attacking Gordhan because the man is a machinery to fight corruption and state corruption @Zikhona Zondani I think AfriForum is going to seize EFF assets this week. Watch the space. "how ironic that while zuma is on the hot seat No.9 you in trouble I think you could be right Keith Manuel said he will donate the R500k to the VBS victims Manyi buy new Age 
1:57:19,1:59:05, Malema and his creche! 😂😂😂 makhosi nobhatyi : GORDON FIGHTING CORRUPTION THAT IS A LIE COLLECTIVE DOES @makhosi nobhatyi They hate Pravin for exactly that. I can't understand why media can't show both sides of the story on this..... especially press. He said he wants no agents or middlemen involved in the distributing the money @Andries Kgwax Not Gordon maarn 😂 I specifically waited for this day at the commission @Andries Kgwax Pravin was a hindrance to Zupta corruption...why he was removed and why van Rooyen was installed? "The EFF hate Gordhan I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE PRAISE ONE MAN FOR FIGHTING CORRUPTION 
1:59:22,2:01:58, Jimmy manyi's name will come sooon "There are many being praised @Andries Kgwax Its the reality. He was my boss for 7 years at SARS. Some people didn't like him cause he was strict on expenditure... He did the same with the corrupt Zuma crew and got fired overnite this chaula "@Andries kgwax Gordhan he spoke out when there was allegations level by NPA "I wonder what the party with social media votes is going to do this week Mara Zuma was and is an imbecile. The Guptas were actually laughing at the country (with Zuma) after the Waterkloof drama. Some unknown guy took the fall but Zuma knew!!! where is facebook and twitter inaugurating malema? @Andries Kgwax Don't be a denialist of the reality pls... Pravin hindered or prevented all the corrupt Zupta deals. He even gave Malema's funders a lot of problem on cigarette smuggling. 
2:02:13,2:03:22, malema's inauguration on youtube will be held on friday @ 12h00 There are politicians and officials who give credence to this saying/proverb: “Empty vessels make the most sound.” Will eventually catch up with them. @Zikhona Zondani 😂😂😂😂😂 "Anyway This state capture mustn’t divide us instead unite us to fight any action of corruption and state capture no more that we allow to happen that is lie Yep - only the ANC fools couldn't see that Zuma is a crook. Their votes caused all these problems for SA. And they are still being fooled by empty promises. what more evidence is required now??? to me this is enough evidence to jail the implicated ppl I am ANC not Gordonist 
2:03:43,2:05:07, "Yes jail them all and leave zuma alone @Andries Kgwax Don't make your problems ours. Gordon will not sent anyone to Jail "only people from the daycare have the guys to call others ""fool"" 😂😂 ." Derek Main i dnt have problems Are you even listening to your own reasoning @Andries Kgwax? You still vote for ANC after all this proof of corruption. That's a big problem in my book. "@Zikhona Zondani lol . I see these comments saying other people are fools 
2:05:18,2:06:41, yes i voted ANC AND IT WON ANC all the way who do smart people vote for ?? YES So in your opinion the rest of the population has no say if they didn't vote ANC? dont worry its my money "I was shocked and seeing as embarrassing report PP findings #Andries Kgwax--Me TOOOO ANC ANC ANC

Let’s remind ourselves what Tito Mboweni said during his budget speech: There is no more spare money around. We cannot bail out failing SOEs.THERE IS NO MORE MONEY. Our debt to GDP ratio is too high. "@Zikhona Zondani If you can sit here and listen to all this evidence of corruption caused by the ANC and still vote for them 
2:11:47,2:12:55, ofhle you can't trust this guy because he' steal nothing you trust people who steal as they give you share . So the former president behaved like a shareholder in the Gupta media empire? "@Derek Main you as a smart person "Derek I never worked for the state and played my tax thank you.Dont project Zuma theft on innocent citizens @sipho cebo Anyone but the ANC. and this thing of these daycare goers calling people fools and idiots for not voting for them is deeply rooted in the eff. the fools voted. live with it! "We voted ANC not to defend but expose corruption and those whom done wrong bring money back and sentenced because they belonged in prison He is a shareholder asks him 
2:13:08,2:13:48, in total agreement Derek... Zikhona must be living the dream 🙄 @Thami Ngwenya Aaah - the race card. I take it you can't argue on the merits. Yoh who must we vote for ?😂😂😂 @Derek Main so what are suggesting is that I just tick on any box in the ballot paper ?? eff @Topsy Kretts speak for yourself @Zikhona Zondani Anyone but the ANC - they are crooks. #Magda Seguin-- Thats what we need isnt 
2:13:50,2:15:12, No argument when you insult people @sipho cebo That would definitely be smarter than voting for the ANC. @Derek Main lol .. you are funny @Thami Ngwenya I'm saying it like I see it. "In my opinion you can vote for whoever you want to AAAhga Jimmy Manyi 😂😂 not vote for them because they are crooks. that is just a weak argument. Derek can i vote for the party you voted for? anyway what is your party? "Thami 
2:15:22,2:16:23, I said it categorically that this must be the last 5 years of the once glorious movement and still say it Ten Million voters ignored insults and voted for the ANC +FF is a good choice @Zikhona Zondani Have you not been listening to all this testimony? ja u were right cassius "Millions are hungry and have no jobs "Derek is insulting  @Kekeletso Timati Sure - why not. UDM @Magda. crime is high not only because of criminals but also the nonchalance of the communities. you know perpetrators and dont act. we just cry 
2:16:27,2:18:04, "If you voted ANC yes agree We all voted according to our consciences. Too late to still continue to canvass for votes. Now criticise the parties’ policies and what their leaders do and say. "Thami "@Thami Ngwenya sadly that is all Derick ever does here Julius once said .. the ANC will be in power until Jesus comes back .. . 😂😂😂 "@Zikhona Zondani ""Fools"" is putting it politely."

Juju was 100% spot on UDerek uya painelwa "Calling us fools "Everyone wanted Cele Not really fools because they didn't know what has been happening behind closed doors Anc isn't a problem our leadership are the one stealing from us not the Anc.so because the own the all the arms of law nothing could be done "@Derek Main To vote for the ANC is a right! It is called Democracy. I vote for the party that will further my interest shame they made Zuma be Zuma @Mzalwane Mzala so you prefer corruption over insults. To me none is virtuous 
2:19:16,2:20:11, "ANC WAS and STILL is the ruling party "@Derek main I said to you b4 elections we are not voting for individual "@Derek Main - a fool is a man who decided to discriminate and disadvantage the majority you blaming now. Apartheid is a crime against humanity The Guptas brothers were making lot of fooish acts/games with Zuma because they know he was intellectually flawed @Pelisa Vanda Do you choose to be my spokesperson? @Cerebis Of course people can vote for the ANC. I just think it's idiotic given that the ANC is corrupt to the core and stealing our money. other parties must just win elections .. insults won't help in this case Im afraid "ANC is the name of a party Zuma- the mafia boss 
2:20:28,2:21:28, thnx juju look as today😏 "Cerebis @sipho cebo 👊👊 @makhosi nobhatyi As the ANC has done for the last 25 years? No thanks. @Derek Main I agree with you on the ANC. They are on trial here and in other commissions! "Making excuses for Zuma is playing the victim game @nelson musoliwa they realised that since he is a deliquent they will steal as much as he can and give duduzane crumps he won't tell the difference All those who voted for ANC didn't use their votes wisely. After their own admitted that the past nine years was a wasted yrs. How dare u vote for such organisation knowing exactly that he was part of Here we are talking about the cancer which is eating our country which is corruption whoever does that we should rebuke them and must go to jail 
2:21:32,2:22:36, so Zuma places nut job in charge of SABC while he spends his time working and pushing ANN7 with tax money. Can anyone define democracy for me? @kenneth mampa There was never an official ANC statement about 9 wasted years. "@Simon Davies No @Millicent Shozi lol ... let a smart one answer that Kenneth mampa we ask who must we vote for now one answered. Zuma screwed the ANC the whole ANC Check the dictionary for a definition of democracy. 
2:22:37,2:24:28, So Manyi was drive to NN7 by Zuma end of the story @Jay Jay I did. "He was a DP president of that wasted 9yrs Read the Constitution then you will understand democracy at it's best.We all are intelligent educated people in this forum..I HOPE @Derek Main You said who must we vote for ?

I'll have to draw you a picture. Can we tone down the insults?? @Derek Main yup .. and will die being one @ben cole -true that 
2:26:52,2:28:22, "Did anyone spot Manyi in the room today I wonder if Zuma still contend that there was no state capture in SA. "@Ben Cole if someone insults you  Did someone who voted for Mngxitama use his/her mind wisely? What a toxic workplace AAN7 was...terrible "@sipho cebo You see - you are part of the problem. So what you're saying is that no matter how bad or corrupt the ANC is or becomes @Derek Main what I am saying here is very simple .. it is my right to vote for whoever I want to vote for ha ha In any case that TV station was a disaster 
2:28:27,2:29:56, Who used their minds wisely? "All Money was channeled to Guptas companies  Manyi reacted to my tweet about black professionals who are out of jobs; the likes of molefe or moyane angrily today so i now know why @sipho cebo And what I'm asking you is do you think at all before casting your vote? Sho that sounds horrible rainwreck @Derek Main why are you asking me that now .. you've already called me a fool meaning you already answered your own question @ Nelson musoliwa - state capture has always been there tata Madiba was captured by the Openhaimers why don't you start there? "Never forget that ALL Zumas wives had the same perks @sipho cebo Exactly 
2:30:07,2:31:16, "Derek Main @Thando Nkutha How do you explain Mayor Bobani and the Hawks' interest in him? so why ask ? @tabze did Madiba bankrupt the country? @sipho cebo to illustrate that you do not vote wisely. ungubaniwena @Derek Main who voted wisely ? I want a rich man can anyone connect me to the guptas tabze are you saying madiba enriched himself in the expense of the nation?

The CAPTURE SURNAME IS ZUMA @Derek Main the fools won .. again To enable the choice of voters there must be a variety of parties in a democracy "Wow Yes - more of the same. "derek @Nelson musoliwa I'm with you just mentioning the fact that the state was captured years agooohh

Freedom of association is part of democracy "Derek Main and Sipho Cebu That is the same app used by the Saudis on their women in the country @Ben Cole You can block me if you like. wow he must really feel something huge in his chest and ego Look for the letter written by IFP to Cyril after nine wasted yrs comment. scathing open letter 
2:34:55,2:36:23, "I am not condoning zum "u confuse us  @kenneth mampa That was Tito Mboweni's formulation. @Zikhona Zondani thank you.. tabze i disagree unless if state capture mean different things to me and you. Anyway Zuma was intellectually disable; was not supposed to a president anyway @Zikhona Zondani That's a typical ANC fool's excuse. Zuma = ANC people have been trying to win votes using Zuma @tabze do yourself a favour and read the 2001 World Bank definition of state capture.It is long but very explicit.Your Freudian slip is showing. "Because Zuma is the norm for the ANC

"Wow thanks I will for the 4th time @kenneth mampa Would you agree that a party's election manifesto represents an official position of that party? I remember when he left SA in a hurry..he ran for his life sections 56 (d) and 69 (d) of the constitution allows for the removal of state officials by means of public petition. stop venting on social media and exercise your true vote! @Thando Nkutha ....that was the EFF who stole Grannies money Freedom of choice is part of democracy MAFIA
