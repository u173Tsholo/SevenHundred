28:21,32:33, The guptas are just a fraction of the corruption that took place during jacob's reign. Bosasa is corrupt. "Jack sparrow MINERAL RESOURCES comes in many forms. it's not just gold Lol Dudu sent text messages to ENCA about todays testimony @Prescott Smith who in the world is truly free? "When South Africans vote vote out this level of corruption and take control of the their land I LIKE IT MR AGRIZZI BUT YOU ALSO YOU MUST GO DOWN WITH THEM "@Thando Nkutha ""For the record I have never had a meeting at Bosasa offices with Gavin. We went as a delegation to the prawn plant. It was an official visut. This man is lying""" *visit Jack sparrow I am quite sure you fully understand the history of Africa and Europe.

I am not stupid.Fully aware! ANC greed messed up the economy #teg Agrizzi is grizzing and he maen business.. 
2:00:54,2:04:00, why should the implicated lawyer be notified? @Bongumenzi "He has been stealing money with Bosasa but now we have to praise him because he came foward @McLaws Ndinisa we all a tad judgmental right now but really group... would you say NOOOO to 12 milli a year for 10 years ahahahaha?????
