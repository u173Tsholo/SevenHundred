21:03,26:16, "@S Mhlabase Msibi-Gordon demand for land is high we can't blame ANC by giving a person an opportunity to serve his people.yet changed to be corrupt "Michael Michael well the root is the same we face here. the COLONIAL structures means they only gave you political INDEPENDENCE theres a smoking gun.... "nono @ Peter Sant "Jack sparrow The U.S. but Peter Sant it is members of the anc who either perpetuated or turned blind eye on corruption. they have been entrusted by the majority of south africans yet they betray @Prescott Smith with the price of resources at the momeny there's no point in taking it out of the ground This is scary. it appears that the country was not only captured by the Guptas 
28:21,32:33, The guptas are just a fraction of the corruption that took place during jacob's reign. Bosasa is corrupt. "Jack sparrow MINERAL RESOURCES comes in many forms. it's not just gold Lol Dudu sent text messages to ENCA about todays testimony @Prescott Smith who in the world is truly free? "When South Africans vote vote out this level of corruption and take control of the their land I LIKE IT MR AGRIZZI BUT YOU ALSO YOU MUST GO DOWN WITH THEM "@Thando Nkutha ""For the record I have never had a meeting at Bosasa offices with Gavin. We went as a delegation to the prawn plant. It was an official visut. This man is lying""" *visit Jack sparrow I am quite sure you fully understand the history of Africa and Europe. They are all through Africa only because of Land and mineral RESOURCES.

The biggest mistake the ANC made which am sure they are regretting now was to make Jacob Zuma president @Nichol....the law courts will decide..... lol refute 10 years of damning evidence Zuma is the downfall of the ANC. @Eslon Eslon thats true because it's all because of him sebuchitheka bugayiwe 
54:01,57:02, @jeevan singh is captured but Agrizzi has at not point disputed being in it. he'shere because he is a whistle-blower. he will have his day in criminal court in the olden days underground this con job would have been dealt with....vrry early When looks the other side what/who is he looking at?

Let’s discuss the proceedings Legal issues DueRes Agrizzi is the hero few people can do this.. @Ndikho Mangisa yes Aggiz is a legent 
1:56:27,1:57:38, legend brother against brother "Ndikho Mangisa He is not a hero he is telling it all freely hes no legend Most people would keep it to the grave This man is a hero At Least we get to the bottom of this sickness "@Doom Ruler Nah 
1:57:44,2:00:39, Would you reject 12 mil a year for 10 years "He is no hero "Gwede Mantashe has to come back here "He came forward on his own Magda Seguin but it doesnt make him a hero But he is the man came in front and is admitted every thing..He aware about the if he is hanging himself. I am not stupid.Fully aware! ANC greed messed up the economy #teg Agrizzi is grizzing and he maen business.. 
2:00:54,2:04:00, why should the implicated lawyer be notified? @Bongumenzi "He has been stealing money with Bosasa but now we have to praise him because he came foward @McLaws Ndinisa we all a tad judgmental right now but really group... would you say NOOOO to 12 milli a year for 10 years ahahahaha?????

Zondo probably get a milli per hearing Zuma was a driver of all shenanigans @Doom Ruler...I worked hard looking after sick people all my life and live on a small pension.I don't need dirty money...I liv The politians implicated must step down. All Bosasa contract must be terminated. Then the NPA must start prosecuting. All Politicians assets must be seized and held by the state. Maybe you have a different vibration of what it means to be honest ask Guptas and zuma @Magda Seguin highly respect your life long service and we need more people like you
