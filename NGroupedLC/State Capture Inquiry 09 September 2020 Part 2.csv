"@ Betty  2020 the year of all trueths ok @Mathapelo. looking forward to the grilling of these crooks who have harmed us / 
19:15,26:10, "This is worrying 12:37am eskom meeting🤔🤔🤔 Tsotsi never once asked the minister why executives who have done nothing wrong had to be suspended ..fishy ? Jongi looks like all the shenanigans at Escom took place late at night. something r it is strange 🤔 I wish he can tell the DCJ why did they meet at midnight. something really was fishy in that meeting "is it Romeo khumalo from back in the day 
26:41,30:42, The decision on the prepayment of R600m to the Guptas also took place late at night I have a strong feeling that he is also not dishing out everything that transpired at the meetings. high life chat board members is it Romeo khumalo from Metro FM?? who was taking minutes at this time 12:37? do you know? Thembhani he is not spilling all the beans. this old guy was used by big Guys in the gvt Erick Mgiba are you saying yes to my question? Yes Wesley Myburgh 
31:09,34:33, thank you Eric No problem Has this guy turned state witness?

34:35,36:33, mzolisi kolwani but how because it was underground "Blake its evident that he did @Thembhani Hlayisani - I also get that vibe.. Yes I do he didnt get a slice of cake ..ppl he wasn't stable to trust:yt:.. "Just in live now This dude is confessing Mzolisi the big issue with him is that he was at the beck and call of Tony Gupta. Why did he said how high everytime the Guptas said 'Jump'??? Its Mr Tsotsi 
36:40,40:01, I was expecting other witnesses. He said he only needed 45 min but now I hear Chair saying we have too much to canvass now. 😱 @Frank dont disrespect ubaba 🤣 "Okay never hear of Mr Tsotsi eskom "Yes sir "Anthony meet Zola Tsotsi 🤣 Jongi (lol) Blake I will never do that😜😜😜😜 
40:34,52:11, Jongi😂😂🤣🤣 "HI Zola Tostsi iarre this bloody guys an zuma is gonna be free they above the law no doubt only small guys will face the music guys just watch it Mr Tsotsi you were in it for MONEY!! Tsotsi is a tsotsi... TSOTSI!!!! 👌 Chair the once removed was also in it for the money 💰 "Bible "" the love of money is the root of all evil"""

So so for got seeing him they have finished our money by now "This commission is useless @ Jongi Cayalli it meant 2031 "when are we going to get the Gupta's true @Stanley "@sims nyandeni 
56:28,58:35, "Bongiwe if they going to start arresting ppl they will have to arrest the whole state 🤣 if we do away with the ANC they will be arrested Why was he having a office at Eskom? I thought he was supposed to be independent Chairman. "Wesley....not just the ANC they will also have to arrest Ramaphosa he is at least an accomplice. too this bs still going on What goes around comes back around my babe haha

Thuli Madonsela said that there will be prosecutions resulting from the state capture commission - she said so quite recently. How do people qualify for these boards it looks like only or mostly stooges are brought in it’s shameful Weve this govt must stop raising our electricity costs and pay up "hiking our portion of energy costs to fit their stealing Guptas in the top 6 eish 
1:08:09,1:09:45, The Guptas decided who sits on the boards .. stooges suited them .. they will follow instructions top 6 runs our country "@rasikhuthuma read the book goes to show how easily the anc can be bought We've gotto stand up and take down to the Commie ANC........if this country is to survive etc..... pathetic how they have tarnished the real struggle ppl faced "all this should be happening in a court room its messed up Lots of people have committed perjury at this Commission. I hope they get arrested if only for that. The NPA has to be that pedantic 
1:09:58,1:11:25, "politicians steal anc... well all the ppl in govt are freeken rogues i would like to know which govt dept had a clean audit? And We are all paying for this bloody crap etc... u r right MIKE i pay my taxes i pay vat i pay sin tax "There are a lot of truths here

How they all thought they were intelligent and had the power.

1:19:54,1:21:33, They should've hired Jub Jub to do this work. agreed Aaaaayy...that is my fear also........ "Surely we as tax payers must be able to do something i read about how to sue the govt it is possible What are they trying to achieve with these audios being played? Are we now trying to prove that the board lied about Mr Tsotsi or what? I'll start believing.......when i see the SOB's in orange overalls and in jail.......for a very long time..... This is all a play for the public to try and show that they are sweeping out corrupt Ministers and Members . 
1:22:01,1:25:12, @skosi injalo this is just gossips waist of tax payers money Zondo nguNondaba kodwa other TV channels no longer have live coverage of this nonsense "@Dj RoB-Era you are very correct they will never be any prosecution for sure :oops:AQAaa "This will make a gripping script for a movie indeed. Don’t know much about Tshediso Matona I'm really p...off with my own country.........we like the laughing stock of the world.......very shameful indeed

1:46:37,1:48:42, im sick and tied of all the skelms @Willie Truter not voting its voting cause if you dont vote your vote is automatically allocated to the ruling party Problem lies with the voters whom will tell you about the ANC of Mandela #Tsotsi must fall jah🤣🤣🤣@sal sa "Then another suggestion "I wish I could believe that Tootsie has finished and he was the main actor of this movie Corruption started when our forefathers got their cows and land stolen. 
1:48:46,1:52:22, Zandile we just need to appoint the right people who are protected from political interference. Ministry or government should not been shareholders. This what we need in Africa Finish off Tsotsi - he must be 'buried' in his shenanigans They will change their colours when they see the $$$$$ Right people are always overthrown by powerful people. We need a coded robot to run this country. Cry the beloved country. What did we do to deserve the ANC in this country? Deon Meyer maybe not private but an independent panel system that comprises public and private on a rotation basis I am so glad to read that the majority of the contributors agree that we need change NOW.Whereto from here? Agree 100%Bongiwe. 
1:52:25,1:55:43, A buile TauTona gore mmuso wa anc ke wa mapantiti o tlile gole sotla banake. now bona gore re sotlega jwang wayforward is important This Chair is fond of his ajourments "@Vusi Weeping Comfort break "The Chair is not a spring chicken WAY FORWARD...SYSTEM CHANGE!!! Where is Shabba? is it adjoi 
1:55:58,2:05:39, is it adjourned for the day? Deon we need to take this forward to a platform where we continue to converge ideas until we agree on the next big step!! Agree it can’t just be left here SHS!! "Common sense "I have great respect for Judge Zondo. He is sober-minded "Teddy today Weekend entertainment Fred And the details are quite shocking we entrusted our assets to the hyenas 
2:07:18,2:10:44, the government is run like a Mafia. Same method. these guys off camera are laughing at silly dry jokes "Ndieni they have only scratched the surface Ei ! I doubt that this commission will be finished on the prescribed time. Process is very slow & there are always new revelations & a lot of adjournments. Time is being dragged Zondo will apply for another extension Who’s dragging time here "money for education Suspects will survive the prosecution 
2:11:09,2:21:11, Zondo commission should be given all the time and resources to expose these shenanigans even if law enforcement agencies do nothing but what we know now we know Mondli then Zondo is going to be investigated for dragging and wasting tax payer’s money. it can be better Bongiwe the ANC @ Luyanda Cwane Eve corrupted Adam. That is where it started. Ei ! All these people know each other from ANC as per Tsotsi 's statement Bongiwe I’m aware that corruption at municipalities is 100 times more than national and provincial those people are eating like there’s no tomorrow "@Bongiwe Moeli ""OVERALL""." These people are on the same whatsup group/ Birds of the same feathers fly together 
2:22:40,2:34:15, The line of questioning portrayed Mr Tsotsi as this innocent Chairperson of the board but fails to reveal instances where he openly disagreed with his board. It is possible he was such a chairperson Oh ! what a delay now. Same yesterday questions about the meeting called by Dudu @ Bonginkosi Zondi ​ disagreeing with board members is not wrong unless it includes criminality. Is our judiciary system a wallpaper or others are just immune Same thing over & over again. somethings will not change "Tsotsi is an unapologetic member of the ANC. How could he have declined the invitation to attend the ANC's Gala Dinner @ Ghost Mapetla ​ some are more equal than others. Our problems start with ANC Previously. The main table in an ANC Galler Dinner is being occupied by the Top Six & sponsors. Tsotsi is not a Top Six member. How did he sit in that table if Eskom was not a sponsor ? 
2:35:31,2:41:04, Dearth of talent among top six:elbowcough::elbowcough: "@Mondli Nohashe yesterday he mentioned that the table of 10 people was occupied by the top six @Teddy Ntsente nope the other i think was from SABC @BOIKANYO MOLOI 100% correct. most SOEs are shadows of former self "anc messes all SOEs Why Eskom installs electricity in illegal built dwellings in Cape Town? "Useless speech about mandates when you failed @Luyanda Cwane cause the constitution says so 
2:41:52,2:45:55, Guptas & SABC represented by Ms Tshabalala on that table as sponsors . Question . What was Tsotsi doing in that table if Eskom was not a. sponsor ? In our lifetime we wont be able to have functioning country because our leaders dont love this country but see it as a mule to be milked while they fill there pockets "So "@pastor @Mondli Nohashe lol you heard him yday he was shocked and didnt know who booked the seat for him in the top 6 table "Tsotsi means a thief Sleg Cyril live at 6pm on ENCA feed with Sanef @zip reeper i think @pastor is at that noisy group of ENCA eix there are lot of noise makers that side ESKOM dose not have a problem but greedy people 
2:46:25,2:52:55, @BOIKANYO MOLOI thanks my friend anyone who will vote 4 anc isblind to the current affairs Why so many board meetings when there is a CEO and management?? this is the exact reason why SOEs fail. too many hands on the deck "@thabiso he is being economical with the truth now and trying to cover tracks "@Salome Seabi  It's by design to twist and grab. Technocrats are failed by some political entities. "EDUCATION has failed Eskom @Mabona but Ramaphosa has already given prima facie statement that incrimate anc in corruption. is that not a fact enough not to deter anyone from voti ng anc? 
2:54:04,3:00:38, that incriminate "If just high voltage can make the country to be so dark "@Salome Seabi We already have Nuclear sitting at Koeberg. Its now aging to kill us anytime if something goes wrong! Tsotsi has a serious voltage drop with me Is not education but the pure will to fatten there pockets in the expense of our country and when they done they announce a recession "@Brian Butale eix nuclear power im afraid of it with ZANC in power "My point  Tsotsi can be excused now... he looks tired. 
3:01:26,3:04:23, Yes. Tired "@Canis Africanis "He had a long one @Canis Africanis. I concur. Must be sweating bullets now. Age also counts :goodvibes::goodvibes: I tsotsi Old people are failing us! "Which one

3:12:21,3:15:12, "the chair giving preliminary findings "He does not suffer from amnesia like others  All charges against top people involved in capture of Escom should be charged with treason against the state when Guptas were there we never had load shedding "A bond that costs R500 000 all facts point to zumas selling state power to the guptas by curry zuma where r u msholozi. uphi umshin wakho 😂🤣 "I am inclined to agree with you Brian.
