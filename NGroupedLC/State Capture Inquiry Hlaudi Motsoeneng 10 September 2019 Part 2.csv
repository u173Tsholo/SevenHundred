time,5:39,message who is in here?☺ Hellooooo.... Bliksem but these people can waste time. TaxPayers Money - Rap Up and Jail sentence!! but what was so difficult to complete the matric or maybe I just don't understand what was difficult about completing matric 🤷🏽‍♂️ What talent did he possess to be head hunted?.. I think he was Alvin Kloppers garden boy. "@Derick Mampuru Exactly - if Hlaudi is as smart as he keeps on claiming 
6:33,8:52, @This Is Balls There is Orania for people like you. Apparently there were others hired without their matric qualifications @Xoli Mbatha But not at the position he was employed - only at much lower levels. Bring back colonization ...he was initially head-hunted for a different lower level post @Thando Nkutha Even not-so-intelligent people pass matric. It is one thing not to have a formal qualification. Many people do not have the opportunity to attain one. But it is a different ball game to be a crook and a skelm. Today you will pass with F @Thando Nkutha We can't advocate a situation where board members don't need to have matric. That is the absolute minimum they require. 
9:28,11:22, corporate governance paralysis at SABC under the watch of Ben Ngubani "Back in '96 and earlier it was not uncommon to employ people without matric. However Even the Police Force Minimum Requirements Matric - and so how many of them have a Matric?? hahaha shame this guy is a clown "...as mentioned he was encouraged to pursue his metric qualification thereafter @Thando Nkutha . My brother i think you picking on me again. The part of the idiots who have degrees......hahahaha Matric "If your an illiterate thief you can become president of South Africa forgiven 
11:35,12:31, hlaudi is very smart all those undermining him are publicly humiliated when they engage hlaudi for example #shekkinah .kwe do it's about understanding but about experience and understanding and Godly wisdom. certificates are meaningless @Thando Nkutha What's the point of wasting your time getting a matric then? Are those people wearing Purple t-shirt walking out accompanied by Police HLAUDI's political party supporters? Matric 🤭🤭🤭🤭 cic malema Especially with the likes of Zuma.. no-one needs Matric or qualifications . Zuma set a precedence. 😂 "Ok Hlaudi never lied 
12:46,14:35, 😂😂😂😂😂 u can say that again @derik henikom is known enemy agent The Reason they won't let go of the Matric aspect! Hlaudi was on the Board and misrepresented himself in terms of his applicant!! So he needs to admit to his Lies full-stop hahaha @Thando Nkutha OK - playing the devil's advocate. I like it! 😀 hes lying so much his pants are on fire!!! she she she Lies won't save the Nation also!! experienced people will save us 
14:46,16:58, just a clerk "I think George is trying to say ""they've hired me so clerks add no value here...Hlaudi @Thando Nkutha in 1994 all schools and education forums open for everyone? So his highest Matric Symbol was an E..eish.. I think it is an exemption today I want to combine my Std 7 with my Std 10 to get Masters "@Thando Nkutha I agree that matric is not the be-all-and-end-all. However 🤣🤣🤣😁 😂😂😂😂😂 
17:10,18:12, zondo you coming to it now He should have placed St5 DCJ should move to other parts of inquiry. He won the argument @Lehlohonolo Tsoeute 😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂 i think hlaudi is doing well so far as the few honest man around 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I've obtained my 2nd matric certificate! Just by listening to this live-stream🤞 😵😵😵 "when ter is no straight answers 😂😂😂😂😂😒 
18:19,19:04, Chairman forgot about the bread 🍞 but Zuma didn't pass class 2 and was president 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.the results said i did'nt do well hahahaha ha ha "@Thando Nkutha Schools are for educations not for any other aspect outstanding i like the way chairperson ask questions Oustanding Feedback Hlaudi

20:06,20:44, "@Thando Nkutha yes I do sympathize with conditions though "I think Angie must consider COMBINING these kids score to increase pass rate to 100% Look at Hlaudi does hlaudi know wat is standard 10? he did write but he never passed it @Jabu Malinga Or because he's corrupt enough to meet the ANC's criteria. Chen Pen Sen so the issue here is standard 10 @fikile mbokodi the he has matric but failed He wrote matric but failed it!! 
20:48,21:18, admitted at least "So Thuli had emotions attached to this investigation Hlaudi is d man..hahahahaha.. he could be a great clown "Did u passed St.10 or not He failed matric dismally and never wrote again @Oratile Masipa definitely...he was hired in the correct industry😂😂😂 my son has a grade 2. He is brilliant and is more qualified than those with university degrees. no he doesnot have because there is no certificate His matric certificate is OUTSTANDING because he will obtain it later!!! Then it will not be OUTSTANDING but instanding!!! Or something like that! LOL

23:04,23:38, I can see y Zuma liked this guy. they both the same. a laugh solves all problems He failed history. Not woodwork! hahaha😀😀😀😀 I scraped matric with an IQ of 80 HIS SON lol "Zondo will close up in a corner boy you still a small boy.he says ""you applied knowing that you are lying""" His sin is the desperate state of affairs in SABC whole politician failing history 😀😀😂😂

1:47:51,1:48:22, something is offish about how this lady asks questions "when he says ""chair person""" I agree with Hlaudi in many aspects and the truth is that the guy seem to have had clear vision for SABC. Still his dismissal was justified because he has no qualifications for that post . It was my job to interfere absolute nutter Interfere....🤣🤣 Nutter of note "@Shadrack Dichaba it is true. we are told lies by media how she lacks to probe. however i do like that she gives hlaudi an opportunity to respond to her questions

Did he just say its his job to interfere? 😀😀😀 independent to who who interfering Lets hear his research theory so he thought he had the right Hlaudi suggests a woman confused him into accidentally claiming he had matric Craziness and naivety
