So a taxi driver who dropped out of uni is Eskom's savior it's worth watching ....go and buy data Drove taxis in the early 80s. No privileges come with being black 
25:45,28:05, This guy is saying not that i am aware off "Yes it's worth watching @Njabulo Khuzwayo You chose to ignore his long business leadership experience "there were no mini bus taxis in the 80s THE PAST DOES NOT DETERMINE YOUR FUTURE THR HE CAME @njabulo Khuzwayo no privileges... he was a taxi driver and unionist. Kerzner made his CEO of Tosogo Sun. @Mark Dijon He did not jump from taxi driver to CEO. Bad contarcts that gone bad in Nigeria? 🙆 then inform us! 
28:07,30:40, "He done nothing Zuma was not interested in telkom "He may not have been captured by the Guptas Telkom the only SOE that showed profit Agreed. "@Selecta Jabu voice too high Telkom is doing great becouse it's Information Technology......hala to coding hello Big up to Tech 
30:51,32:14, @ Makhosi Taxi Driver's Voice big up to tech indeed Shareholders......obviously Former mageza Telkom uses EBITDA. This is a questionable accounting practice. "@Selecta Mayer Kahn and Sol; Kerzner are Jewish "A university dropout turned Telkom around Problem is that we still rely on Electricity.....it's time to implement our own solar systems.

"Bonke for me it's about everyone becoming a contributive member of society and where every human being has value to the country and adds value 
35:36,39:09, @michael mbatha Don't to be stuck to 1981. The man has a PhD from Wits. What bomb can we expect from Mabuza? Telkom's pricing model that he is talking about was rancid with favouritism.
