It's long been defined and no longer needs defining We cant even inherit racism if we do not have the things that give it power. Colonialism has to unfortunately accept that its greatest global exports were racism; eploitation & inequality. Black people have always and will always pour their hearts to all other kind of races across the world yet among-est ourselves we carry that hatred for one another. Trying to understand why?????
