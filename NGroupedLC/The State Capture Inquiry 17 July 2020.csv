"Pravin nd ANC thieves ACTUALY WE NEED FRESH BLOOD IN SA GOVERNMENT THESE OLD PEOPLE MUST GO If you are an auditor you would pick it up!!!

Just compare the evidence as led for SAA audit MOST OF THEM SHOULD BE IN PENSION PWC can't even audit themsef they participated in state capture shame on pwc and all others 
1:58:07,2:02:09, "Auditors are the ""police""for financial misdemeanour acts. These guys are just like SAPS and they behave in the same way. With impunity???" All material SAA findings were raised after the AG took over. Private firms need to raise their bar and stop hiding behind their names & size. never mind the 10b where is the 500b government set aside for covid 19 assistance... for our population of 55 million....pü§îü§´üò≥üôÑ private sector also corrupt THEY ASK The Corporate Governance Officer would have picked it up....

2:19:53,2:24:18, U SEE MY POINT THEY R ALL CLUELESS @PILLAY These people think we are fools @Zakhele Tshabalala we have conceded and me and you agree on that point however you know a person who knows people who are doing the corruption but they never expose them yah neh THE CORRUPTION IS CURRENTLY HAPPENING AT ESKOM I am out guys.. @zakhele I am wasting my time and data watching this guy get embarrassed....on live TV....

2:32:25,2:34:25, "Implement the regulatory laws and stop fussing we still have credible politicians in this country but they are being sidelined so that the looters can play their game freely. @Francois Mauritz Botha BRING ANYTHING BUT NOT THE ANC "Guys I am not a politician or take any party side. but there is nothing wrong with the ANC he can't escape scrutiny from chair. we are not in a supermarket where you can pick and choose Today the commission is super relevant heavy focus- haha Zakhele Tshabalala ‚Äã@Francois Mauritz Botha BRING ANYTHING BUT NOT THE ANC you bloody mad 
2:34:30,2:38:08, @Seelan&Patsy Pillay easy baking 101 JHO ANC AI "its uneducated people in positions that need to use your brain IM RUFFLING SOME FEATHERS NOW no due deligence in projects he was part of. this is so embarrassing for South Africa as whole since when? Threshold The whole auditor "Why does this gentleman not understand the questions?? What was the deliverable list? It doesn't matter how long it takes Who audited the gentleman`s mental capacity. 
2:38:37,2:40:52, his mother Marcus ü§£ü§£üëåüèΩ that's my argument @moose... this poor guy cannot understand or reply to any questions... sad times for SA @moose üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖü§£ü§£ü§£ he is going to cry now They've sent the wrong representative üòô. he cannot answer a single question properly.... how can he read numbers..üôÑüôÑüôÑü§îü§î at last. 
2:42:17,2:46:08, Sorry this gentleman... how can you be with PWC?? I'm sure PWC is embarrassed. "@ seelan if they gave each citizen 1billion each they would have had more than  @schnaar read properly..... I said 1 MILLION each.... not BILLION..üòâ Schnaar.. I'm sorry but your math is wrong üïä let's not get confused... I never go to school with JZ... @ dean who's math we have 60 million people in this country how many South Africans then multiply X 1000000 = "why are these racists so judgemental about pwc auditor? I believe he is qualified and competent auditor imssyimg they could have given each person 1billion and still had billions 
2:46:35,2:49:00, why only 1 million each He is really battling its smacks of lies anyway....let's not be up in arms with each other here..... we will not even smell a cent of that money....its all gone already... 60 million X by 1 million equals "we have almost 60 million citizens with 500 billion why must we get 1 only a million each and leave more for them to pocket...:dothefive: I did not say that some said 1 mill to each person yes thats the sad truth. Eastern Cape is in a total mess health dept is incompetent but spent millions on motor bikes with side cars which could have gone towards cleaning up the hospitals ü§êü§êü§êü§ê 
2:49:22,2:50:59, "Richard we are not racist we would have jacked our economy up big time. whereas now its all gone and nothing changed "With ZA being R4 trillion exactly Lunar ja SA is not going well Luna everyone to do with SAA battle with making themselves clear "Criminals will they ever get to the truth 
2:51:11,2:53:14, "if he told the truth  just seems like corruption in every department on gov "How many people lost their jobs at SAA in Eastern Cape certainly. @hellen... that will never happen... this is a dress rehearsal for the public...its a losing battle we fight here. these culprit must be in jail by now together with jupter... #Luna 0 "As much as he is not a Lawyer we lost the battle long ago...25 years in and its a total shambles. 
2:53:27,2:55:35, @sibiya.. I agree.. ag shame if we steal or are corrupt we go to jail same should apply to all South Africans Thanx Barbara üòä Enquiries way too long and costing taxpayers billions. Start prosecuting and send these people to jail these guys will make life difficult for us citizens with a traffic fine we dont know about...but for the real corruption go unpunished.. You're more than a disappointment not only as an auditor but to the entire country.. by simply overlooking inaccuracies of that magnitude is call fraud..all your personal assets should be seize .. errrr errr ummm ummm blah blah ...just tell the truth and face the consequences..UBUNTU and guess what some of your tax paying money going down the drain on this because nothing going to happen after all this crazy show

Whether Ms Hofmeyer has taken a view its immaterial Kanjani DD... Mev Hofmeyer should focus on understanding what transpired at SAA not at making the Auditor look incompetent The auditor is making him self look incompetent ü§•üßê "@magabudla KaMphikeleli  agree with you @Craig Johnson
