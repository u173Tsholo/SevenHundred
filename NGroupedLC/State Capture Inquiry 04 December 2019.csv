I'll come back here for the next witness They've called this guy again 
51:40,1:09:26, Mornings! Who's this?

1:10:51,1:37:48, Our country will be the best in the world with money looted by indians This boy is very clever and hs prepared himself very well and cautious. MY STAR WITNESS Anc stupid how can they be captured by indians who just arrived in our country Makwa Chona raher say stolen by Guptas because if say Indians not all Indians are like Guptas @Makwa üòÇüòÇüòÇ @Makwa Choma Pure greed. The ANC is corrupt to the core. Still plundering. @Stronger together - wishing you success! Goodluck @Stronger Together 
1:38:38,1:54:44, Best wishes for your interview ST my chairman today is very quiet not like yesterday questioning Baloyi "@Stronger together  time wasting instead of opinions formulas must be applied "Sorry I am late are we back on Transnet? thanks I remember this accent üòÖ... unkabi ubuyile surely chabi can give us a professional opinion on what went wrong instead of prolonging this nonsense 
1:55:41,2:00:52, @Lucky123 Thwala - he only questions liars Chabi seems like a very smart guy. Someone he Hawks could use to delve into corporate corruption. @Derek Main - agree We should be proud as a Nation that we are developing and have in our midst such amazing talent as we see in Alister Chabi. We need to encourage and support more Alister's. "After watching some of our parliamentarians it is a pleasure @Pastor J - agree - he has a brilliant understanding didn't the Chair mention that he isn't much of a fan of tables? "@SAM STORIES - he's a lawyer Actuarial scientist 
2:01:12,2:03:23, he is an actuary "six of one and half a dozen of the other @Bianca Arnold ....Actuary he is true @ Jacqui " Holds ab BEconScie degree from WITS "I was referring to Mr Zondo - he's a lawyer which is why he's not a fan of tables "@Jacqui Baumgardt ...Particularly the ""under the table"" issues. hahahahaha. Just my immense sense of humor" 
2:03:40,2:14:24, ü§£ actuaries apply statistical history and must refrain from giving opinions. Man Brain Alert: I wonder how is this lady in the B room. she is a bookworm I told you'll. The Chair wants this over and done soon. He can't take it anymore @Sam...definately correct The Chair is so bored by Mr Chabi's knowledge of finance that he cant wait for the interview to finish. He needs a tea break " 
2:14:52,2:21:21, how can you be awarded a tender for something you do not have? " "@Ricus Ellis  @LED BULPS more like corruption Why would a spec have Yen and Dollar yet the hedge is in Dollar? this is crazy and obviously this currency confusion will mean the hedge does not benefit transnet and its pointless NPV of this will lower........ This bid was in shumbles @ Brendan they did have 'something' hence they got those tenders. That 'something' was connections they thought the dollar and the yen was one and the same like a 50cent was more than a 5bob 
2:21:24,2:28:08, The expert with an accent is back. Only if he can tell us what is happening in simple English. I don't understand what this guy is saying. they were plain dof about hedging 20E = R30. 9m as per 2013 " Adv Sello should follow what is being said Led Bulps you are spot on " @LED BULPS ...He is an Expert Witness and not an Incriminated Party. Lets not hook him up I'm sure the only people who understand Chabi are Chabi and himself. 
2:28:29,2:32:01, "100 Locomotives Zukile Mawisa Lol chabi has got his limitations 19E modification by CSR is crazy and hegde of Dollar v ZAR didn't benefit as the memo was in Yen.......... just crazy " "100 and 1064 locomotives........ done for now "This commission is very depressing indeed. The billions stolen by so called leaders is really heart-wrenching " LED BULPS we appreciate you too thanks LED

Jozi needs an honest Mayor who works for the betterment of the People rather than following a Party line to our detriment Uncle Fana is on the stand. Oh yeah. let's get this going "vertaal dit asb in engels @Gee Peex1 ‚Äã Exodus 1:13 and all following verses. John 29:11 and all other following verses. uncle Fana 
3:08:47,3:10:52, This does not help me. Please give me what those verses actually say. I do not posses a bible @Maria Raboshakga And yet the same criminals get voted into power time and again.

3:15:52,3:19:55, @ Sthakathi Khumalo ‚Äã I did not listen to Chabi. Too complicated for me. The comrade is wearing a very retro jacket A confident liar. Too sure of himself. who is this guy? @Zukile Mawisa Yes - an accomplished liar. "Looks very expensive too Rob. Our money Fana who is the evidence leader?

"Where is Hoffmeyer "@Maggie Render .....Some of us didn't believe him even when he said"" I am Fana Hlongwane""" Mr Duduzane Zuma 
3:24:59,3:26:38, @Zukile Mawisa very expensive but tasteless too. I guess the more weatlhy you become the more tasteless in terms of dress sense. I wouldn't wear that for a million dollar üòÉ "The evidence leader is KEY Mr D I am pleased that I am not the only one. Jonas is supposed to be a friend so why all the secrecy. i don't remember WHAT A LIAR Chair step in now.. @ Pastor J ‚Äã@Maggie Render . I think it is the same Fana Hlongwane who gets mentioned in the Arms Deal. HE'S ARROGANT 
3:27:07,3:28:24, i don't understand "Strange how these guys have memory loss @Phillip Cwazibe yes he is Mr Hlongwana is here to collaborate Duduzane's version. no respect at all from this guyüòí @Phillip Cwazibe Yes - same one. He was corrupt a long time before the Guptas arrived. i think the lady has to slow down too "very arrogant Far too arrogant for this young lady.The chair should protect her. 
3:29:07,3:30:42, "Its a game he tries to play @ Yezwe Nxumalo ‚Äãi the lady is playing someone but her true personality. arrogantüòè " i think she is an intern. he undermine the lady you can see his face YES HE IS these ladies are bringing it! but he will eventually crack .......and forget everything 
3:30:42,3:33:09, He will just corroborates Duduzane's evidence aha "Shame i feel for the lady advocate First time I've seen her @lesley klinck Unfortunately I don't think so. He's a well-practised liar. I have a urge. To give this arrogant fella a running klap and extract the truth....Someone please stop me. " DCJ will be doing a lot of questioning of this guy - he picks up on the lies @Pastor J I've got your back. always bro 
3:33:27,3:37:51, the lady will end up emotional. " This guy is a patriarchist "pathological liar "The rumor that has no substance that they had to call a ""private meeting"" for it?!" iam being blackmailed but I do not what is it aboutü§£üòÅüòÖüòÇ LOL "if you are blackmailed "The arrogance of this man 
3:37:56,3:43:31, Thank you for protecting the young lady DCJ. Adv Hoffmeyer shoud be interogating this sly fellow "@Bianca Arnold  The rumor was to lure Jonas to Saxowold. I believe Jonas's version 150% "Watchout @willie maphosa - you should see what Shakespeare would have said "No privacy at the Hyatt. They then get privacy "From a rumor Inconceivable that grown ups can approach a youngster to mediate 
3:44:14,3:48:17, " INDEED Anathi commrades Huh? Stop pulling your face lana wena so rude Jonas was lured. this oke needs a smack. I get the impression that this fool does not respect women. Agree 
3:48:22,3:50:05, agree Deliberately going round in circles. Adv Hofmeyr must come. this man is a foooool "Yes Pastor "Is there a difference between Friend and Comrade what about cadre? But Hofmeyr got balls... üòÅ "I think this comrade is like this generally 
3:50:10,3:53:56, That as well Jacqui i believe they different "This lady will lose it KATE! uDuduzane ungenaphi kumgosi DCJ must stop putting words in Hlongwane's mouth Of rumours and mutton curry. Why would Mr Jonas go to a useless meeting about rumous organised by a young man? Ordinarily Xhosa man wouldn't do that let alone a deputy minister. This should have been much easier. witness is being difficult. " 
3:54:40,3:57:21, "the problem with statecapture Zombies is that they hav written their own scripts about certain individuals is he not up for corruption something to do about HEALTH do you think this advocate is sharp enough for this witness? It seems that Park Station would have been more private than the Curry Den speak up! He is not going to give us anything useful this one. "I think she is doing pretty okay DCJ will trip him up 
3:58:22,4:02:39, "Yes Jacqui "‚ÄúThe rankest compound of villainous smell that ever offended nostril‚Äù The Merry Wives of Windsor (Act 3 Then how do you know a Gupta walked in if you didnt see? I hear you @Sthakathi Khumalo @redriger I wouldn't wash my jalopy with that rag "@siabonga Moloi Maaka fela rewritten on his face This oke concurs Zuma's story of the same meeting yet he can't recall anything said by Jonas.:wow Maaka fela rewritten on his face 
4:03:32,4:07:44, "We won't get anything to be honest "@Sthakathi Khumalo  "I am peripheral judge @Ditiro Mawai I get the same feel. If lies were a person they would look like Mr Fana Hlongwane funicanz SO when Zondo writes his report what do you think he is likely to recommend in this saga - who was lying here? Sunday who is this guy? " oh boy. I'm so sorry I asked 
4:08:55,4:12:25, Thanks LED "@Sthakathi Khumalo The main puppet - Zuma would clearly show that the Guptas were pulling his strings " " Judge gonna sort fana out before lunch @Gee Peex1 .....Mr Gupta threatened to kill him if he ever revealed what happened "@Sthakathi Khumalo  Zondo must leave Uncle Fana alone @Person of interest I think it is clear Fana is concealing a lot. Right now this matter has been well rehearsed to mislead. 
4:12:26,4:15:55, " "But Fana @Gee Peex1 .....Try and suppress the stupidity. It is a quote. "Norman Zwane Ngiyakuzwa Mangethe uncle Fana Loves the young man and the Guptas @Gee Peex1 ..You have asked the same question for the upmteenth time in the last 3months. The answers will not change "funicanz Thats true Their was an attempt but the Hawks presented him with an already prepared statement. No trust. No report Very odd 
4:17:20,4:20:17, "@Sthakathi Khumalo  No one and no one is above the law@Gee Peex1 . Recently not even the No1 skelm Well rehearsed to deceive This guy is boring " if you are accused of blackmailing you dont take headon with the person? "@Victor  @Vicror very imagine grown man having a third party arrange a meeting to settle a matter that arose from a rumour 
4:20:21,4:22:47, He is hiding something @Gee Peex1 ..In any event. The incident was reported to the then PP. Subsequently to the Hawks by David Maynier of the DA. Only a Confirmatory statement was required from Mr Jonas. Dont forget the ARMs deal Fishy for sure @SAM STORIES I dont understand his sanity "Fana knows very well that in the ANC Jonas never reported the matter. he just spoke to media "Wonderful counsel Was this rumour about making of a nuclear weapon that we cant hear it.He is actually lying with a straight face to protect the Guptas and Duduzane. 
4:22:53,4:25:21, The content and context of the PP report will never be considered Hearsay. It is and was reported as a fact@Gee Peex1 Liar. "The Commission personnel is paid by the state he has to be subpoenaed to attend a commission of enquiry but willing to attend a meeting to adress a rumour No progress The way he talks it really sounds there is no truth in him This guy is way too arrogant. He knows nothing will happen from this. Monday " 
4:25:24,4:27:50, @Patience Moeti He is arrogant because he knows nothing will happen. @ Stronger let's just say he makes more sense when he is quiet than he is when he is talking "This guy is of no use man yes he knows nothing will happenüò° @lesley klinck Sadly this is South Africa. People vote corruption in then ask why South Africa is burning. "He intimidates her He is literally smiling with a smug face. why did jonas remain dep. minister "@Stronger together If a country intervenes then other countrys say it's ""racist""." 
4:28:16,4:29:48, His jacket is a bigger puzzle for me than his replies... He thinks he's clever but DCJ is onto him. He thinks he smarter than everyone uncle fana @Person of interest ...That jacket has potential. Too wash cars maybe? Judge misses nothing @Person of interest hahaha - so true lying through his teeth. Do away with BEE. It's not only minorities that suffer. The only people who benefit from BEE are people who are family members of politicians. hahah lol Mr Zondo
