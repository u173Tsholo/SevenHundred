41:54,42:53, "@Pastor JJ "20 people are watching Cyril""s speech 🤣🤣🤣" Zondo is off the mark "Why can't ""ZT"" sit still? Is the chair biting him or his conscience?" This is pedantic  report is more important than a general document report=findings come on do not play around Say yes or No "@melds melds  @brutos17 don't be that person 🤣😂 
43:09,44:39, How many minutes left of the 40 for EL? pendantic....😂 Lovely day here in cape town.Just had some nice snoek-breyani with lemon atchar & a glass of cold water. wind picking up again here "Maybe that's why news24 sent update that he is being grilled by SA Editors lucky you Ismael Tendani I was watching that wriggling chair.... Reports vs documents. Really? pedantic semantics 
45:07,46:50, the person sitting next to him also has ants in the pants pedantic is an insulting word......... Mr Tsotsi you are the weakest link....Goodbye 🙃just saying "report is based on a set of documents Report is a final piece after summing up everything therefore there shouldn’t be a debate about the difference in it and a document  If “over scrupulous” yes Who runs the show? But i am referring to his concern to “minor details” 
46:56,47:51, Interpretation of fact finding wir sind die Pedanten. There's an old German song :videocall: "Dianne where is Stix? Documents presented to president are reports So there was a report that you are aware of. Stay safe and have a restful weekend everyone. Am meeting a friend @15:30 - he's being entrenched and not taking it well what lies are we giving our ears to today? 👂👂👂 
47:52,50:30, lol ismail its a saying "@Blake Yogi ... rentrenched* Hey Stix. How are you doing? "@Lerato Moleke "bye Lerato "@Blake Yogi Bye Lerato! Are you a counselor or psychologist or just helping a friend? "I love the Eskom stream. I have a feeling though 
51:40,53:17, "@Tendani Stay @Lerato Show him where his job went to Zondo is the reason why this commission is behind schedule  "Diane @Lerato I love that. Blessings 🙄 To all of you on this chat enjoy the commission will interact again after two weeks "He talks slowly 
54:31,1:03:28, @Mangalani Mangalani Kid gloves are only taken off in a court @Victor I watched TRC & PIC and others. The chairmen were very firm and straight to the point. you werent at your best at being able to deal with yourself??🤯🤯🤯🤯 I guess its differences in personalities..Naturally he wants to be thorough why is suzanne damiels coming back to testify? 'The Peoples President' ugh @Victor. that aint a guess. thay is a spot on observation "@Antoinette Meyer "@Antoinette Meyer  
1:04:11,1:11:46, no sanctions when they return for second intervention @Heather Durr - I Tend to Lurk a lot as I am working on many screens at once and only contribute when I am doing a Job boring like watching the paint dry. 😊 sounds like Hamlet's soliloquy and we still going on....... I get the feeling that the legal team thinks ms Daniels is not coming as clean as she could The truth the part truth and the half truth  This Guy is a smoothie at the commission total antithesis of what all the other witnesses describe him in meetings. DCJ is also too friendly with him. The EL is toothless too. Bring Kate back. Nick Lanelle is another smooth Spin Doctor as well IMHO. "Dan chair is not satisfied with selekas work 
1:12:23,1:17:54, I agree Valencia. I believe Seleka's self confidence is slowly eroded by DCJ's interruptions Even Mr Sony 📼😂 Yesterday had more gutzpah ! "@Teunis van Ree Sadly it seems that when ""certain witnesses"" give evidence we tend to see a different side to the DCJ. Am I the only one noticing this?" did som1 put somtin in chairs water pastor yes pastor j.j you not the only one I see that too. "@Pastor i notice it more with certain ""evidence"" leaders" @Roza E Greetings Dearest Roza 
1:18:09,1:19:41, Pastor hello "He's a lovely guy but too Jovial with some witnesses IMHO "when seleka is here then chair almost runs the whole show @Valencia J That too. Some seem to command more respect than others it seems. NO Pastor you are not @Valencia J Very true "maybe seleka is just a soft guy theunis hello @Roza hello swty 
1:20:01,1:21:14, That is why it takes so long-DCJ interrupts each train of thought leading to a particular point and we go back and round again Yes or NO i suppose being a lawyer or advocate or EL you must have thick skin otherwise you will cry alone at home everyday😭😭 its not difficult please excuse my capital letters i tend to loose focus on my writing chair is no consistent at all THIS is what consumes the time @Roza or maybe you are shouting😂😂😂 Valencia hello dear 
1:21:33,1:24:38, valencia eish i wish SKills???? They actually search skills? mmmWhich ?skills ok answer is no carry on mr seleka is still our slow poison I doubt we will hear Daniels today viza vee 😂😂😂 Hello folks 
1:24:39,1:26:24, Meeting of the 9th "I am sending uncle Ray espresso coffee @Rudi hey 🙂 rudi hi It seems a lot of Eskom people communicated via ESP as they all have a different story.

I miss you when you're not here!! @Blake Yogi I'm all the better for chatting to you !! x "@Naledi Barron I have been ""on call"" recently with all the Covid outcomes. Its trying times Naledi." ironically the Western Cape judiciary looks more fair than any other hence the WMC gunning the Judge President Hlophe And @Blake Yogi How are YOU?? @Victor so he's on Tsotsi'side? I wonder where Uncle Ray geta an ORANGE click-ofa-bic pen? @Pastor J.J Yes I can imagine the emotional and spiritual stress. Never mind the psychological toll! @Danile Ngubenyathi Correct... He will ask his questions carefully to help his client. in this case mr Tsotsi 
1:54:54,1:56:22, @Ndumie Ndlovu With comments like the last one I now start to understand why people dont take you seriously. Come on Bra @Victor dankie bro @Naledi Barron Unimaginable at times. But we need to keep moving forward. Ok Is son do playing with tootsies mind ? Psychology?  @Pastor JJ I didn't know u know ppl I know🤔 semantics.... Judge President Hlophe is a nasty piece of work. @Pastor J.J No point in looking forward. Just keep your eyes and mind focused on your feet ..... one step at a time neh? xx 
1:56:24,1:58:39, @Rene Ngwenya I swear those numbers challenged me and I can imagine the difficulty for uBaba @Ndumie Ndlovu I do Bro Judge Hlophe can't be captured like those bias police in Western Cape.. who don't treat ppl equal.. 🙄🙄🙄 @Pastor J.J Bwahahahaha! Trevor Noah did a sketch about uBaba trying to hadle the numbers..... @Ndumie Ndlovu The same Hlophe that tried to capture the Concourt Judges? @Pastor JJ u may not take me serious but take what I say serious because it the Truth @Naledi Barron I saw that 🙄🙄🙄 
1:58:41,2:00:08, Oh Naledii that was hillarious @Pastor J.J Sad and hilarious at the same time wasn't it @Antoinette Meyer  @Ndumie Ndlovu I always give you the benefit of doubt bro but sometimes your comments are just too farfetched Yes Naledi. Sattire usually is! SAA NEED ANOTHER 3.5 BILLION so we just forg "@ Rudi Haywood @Pastor JJ by him doing what? but Western Cape Judges follow the law they don't follow their heart and political alignment @Pastor J.J Who is giving you a hard time??? Point me in their direction and I shall go and sort!! 
2:00:16,2:01:42, on top of the 16.5 billion in 2020 the re examination seems to be taking forever so we just forgot about zuma ? "oh my soune=sounds this counselor walk with a speed of verkleurmannetjie 😪 @Pastor JJ let agree to disagree @Ndumie Ndlovu Hlophe is currently known to be the most untrustworthy Judge. How do you see it differently. I challenge one person on the chat to agree with you. This is not correct subject for re-exam 
2:01:45,2:03:30, The Gupta's just a family of Conartists. @Naledi Barron I am on top of it with my Doom in hand 🤕Ndumi The inference is to be drawn by DCJ not subject to re-exam No no no nope He has given his version. THATS IT This is not a civil or criminal court @Pastor JJ because that what the WMC does discredit those they can't control classify them as corrupt.. I'm sure as a pastor you familiar with the story of Jesus. they said he was a thief etc This is all hearsay?? 
2:03:33,2:04:13, you they are grilling him Is ' SHE'' Mrs Brown ?  @Pastor J.J - Hlope is a disgrace to the legal profession I wonder which watch are they using here at Zondo's. ten minutes is so long Lynn brown @Pastor J.J ... what evidence do you have the warrants you to say that judge Hlophe is untrustworthy?..Hope you not basing it on the JSC case that has not concluded? for now its Hearsay  Minister Brown No second bite at the cherry on a point that is highly relevant and now he is changing his version Thought he only needed 10 minutes. 
2:04:37,2:06:28, @Ndumie Ndlovu But Hlophe tried to corrupt the 2 Concourt Judges to favour Zuma. Dont you see that Bro? 💛 Thanks Antoinette ! When ja she going to be arrested? Long overdue  "@ Pastor JJ @Msizi Masikane @Pastor J.J Actually its sub judice @Msizi Masikane His behaviour albeit bad is well documented in Affidavits from 17 Judges sitting under his Presidency.
