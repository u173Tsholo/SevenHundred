Slippery as an eel Colleen Arezio She is very technical I agree.. but she is defending the indefensible.. I think @Colleen Arezio That may be so but I think the Chair is smarter and sees through her BS. please keep the chat clean and respectful Smoke and mirrors @Colleen Arezio- You read her right!! @Michael Wild coming from someone named Wild? 
30:08,32:17, I feel for Ms Memela because she tends to be defensive before she even understand the questions Is the DCJ entertained by this witness @Mashao Mohale That makes her look guilty. I still kee it clean 😁 So sad to see how the people in the colony and territory of my Crown is so unethical. keep "@Michael Wild wild and clean difficult to get the page wonder why our economy is fecked??? these were the fools in charge!

42:20,45:17, "I wish the president can STOP TENDERS FOR EVER "@SS Mbana It's flirtatious lol.... she doesn't recall fat lady is singing "Previous witness testified she came into meeting late @Alex Mlangeni Tenders are essential. It's the people who don't keep to the rules which are the problem. BEE partners also mean that we have to pay more than we would have to without BEE. @Alex Mlangeni-that will start the turnaround in SA "I make a correction. She is dumb @Alex the point is we cant close tenders...lets arrest and jail the corrupt because @home affairs. municipality all its corruption too 
45:36,49:38, BEE means that everybody (including the poor) have to pay for a small elite to become super-rich. @Mtokozisi Baleni well said @ Dominic Przybylski Correct. No reason to buy Michellin Tyres from a BEE entity if could be purchased from a distributor or directly from the factory. They (saart) invented a spurious reason for disqualifying Lufthansa. "I understand @David Tuer Yes - they had already lined up JK/AAR and needed excuses to drop the other bidders. Centrale Africa Airlines Should Be SAA new name and policy holders We need to get our country back from all these corrupt political deployees We are sick of it. police @ hawks keep on failing us @Mtokozisi Baleni That would mean voting the ANC out at the next election. It's the only way. 
50:02,51:07, "@Mtokozisi Baleni ​ Indeed "When will Dudu Myeni be forced to come and account "JAA "Yes @Mtokozisi Baleni - Too true. CR needs to form a task force to focus on bring corrupt employees (and Directors) to book. @dominic przybylski just sounds like you are making every excuse to not have BEE as a policy... understandable only because you may not be a champion of redress. @Nkululeko Mdluli she will get a Zuma type of medical letter lol This is embarrasing in a highest level. This thing of deploying people on positions they dont qualify for is bad What is happening with Dudu's civil court trial with OUTA? 
51:11,53:18, @Gareth Hellyar Tehre were 40+ parties contesting the last election - take your pick. @ Nkululeko Mdluli ​ Dudu Myeni wont come. "oh right "As long as the ANC party is in control of Government @Noxolo Tshabangu The BEE we have at the moment is not redressing anything - just making a few corrupt individuals very rich. true story @Gareth Hellyar That's a defeatist attitude. You may think differently. i think we need a President like Trump who comes from business and sort all this nonsense this party politics is get us norwhere 
53:47,55:36, @Mtokozisi Baleni Careful what you wish for - you might get it. "Yes some ppl will make sure that they never come mumbling Is corruption another word for transformation? Noxolo Tshabangu. "@Derek Main defeatist attitude ? May be  @Mtokozisi Baleni yes we have that president currently. Check what happening in the country @Mtokozisi Baleni - That's a scary thought. @Dirk vd Westhuyzen So let me get this straight - we'll keep on voting for a party that been proven to be corrupt to the core because they are a big party? Ridiculous. @derek main correct... it’s not the policy but the people who run schemes to loot. And these are both black and whites 
55:46,57:41, "She keeps saying remember this "The problem with communism is that it considers economics to be zero sum i.e. for some people to get rich other people must get poorer. Capitalism @ Gareth hellyar you are being willfully ignorant @Noxolo Tshabangu Yes of course - corruption knows no colour. thats crisp There is tension between Ms Hofmeyr and Ms Memela. @Dominic Przybylski What - the trickle-down effect. What a joke. @derek main there’s no issues with BEE then You can cut it with a knife 
57:50,59:02, why is Memela getting stuck as to how to answer some questions? @Derek Main the monster ANC will one day destroy itself. ...and the country. @Derek Main Basic economics - please read up on 'comparative advantage' then get back to me. "@Noxolo Tshabangu Not in principle - in fact @ David maybe it will take a scary thing to happen to change to happen(jail the corrupted and corrupted) "The problem is the Party Political system we have We should have a system where we vote not along party lines what type of leader is this lady? bloody clueless. my grade 7 son can do better Flirting will get you nowhere the DCJ is turning on her The ANC is a huge liability to this country. Their corrupt leaders should not only be sentenced for corrupt activities but for treason. 
59:36,1:00:32, @Chris Mayer The ANC is a moral hazard @Dominic Przybylski The corruption we see in BEE is symptomatic of the greed of capitalism. "This is how JZ was with his evidence leader the ANC is a mafia in suits "This lady is a clear ANC cadre. Making all of us black people look incompetent. Yases "@Derek Main relying on ""trickle-down"" assumes the people who supposedly benefit from economic success have no innitiative and are somehow excluded from doing anything to help themselves." I don't agree or support corruption @derek main so what do we do? Get rid of the policy? 🙊🙉🙈 
1:00:35,1:02:52, "You can talk about Capitalism and Communism and any other ism but what we need are politicians who are patriotic So @Stronger Together the DA cares about the people? @Granny Mokwena they not a mafia it is a charlatan paradise party = toxic hazard @David Tuer I think a mixture. @Stronger together i would love to see people get property rights is tribal land from the 7 Kings we have @Dominic Przybylski Let's be very clear - the 1% have got it wrapped up. The odds are stacked against anyone else. @David Tuer there are people at the extreme ends. "As long as we have a culture which denies the individual and assumes us all to be cows in a herd of cattle Is this Memela Advocate? 
1:02:53,1:04:35, So how do we vote now? Is she still giving evidence? Yhoo!!! @Noxolo Tshabangu We fix it. Harsh penalties for any transgressors. Nail down the rules so people like Memela can't BS that there are grey zones. @Thulani Bukani -if that is true I will apply for my membership card today!!!! "Yes "@Derek Main I'm not a 1% or a 99%. I don't identify myself by race @Dominic Przybylski I think we'd do a lot better if we got rid of politicians. They are more trouble than they're worth. BOOM! "@Toibo wa Toibo Antimba Yes 
1:04:43,1:05:50, @Dominic Przybylski well said wow @Dominic Przybylski I'm looking after myself but I also have a conscience and can't stand the injustice. Progress report is a colonial idea. "@Dominic Przybylski I say that if the wealthy can't grow a conscience DCJ Who are they reporting to? Adv M NOT ME NOT ME Yup "Deny "@Concerned South African Correct  
1:06:36,1:07:55, "The meaning off ""my understanding "" is = I'm not sure but I'll hazard a guess. 😂😂😃" I'm of the opinion that these people believe they are innocent as they don't have the capacity to comprehend how destructive their policies and leaderships were... Rule 3.3 That is why she is where she is...no progress!!! "@Derek Main I look after my own conscience. I'd prefer everyone else to look after their own. If they can't they are likely to end up in court She is an idiot does she even know 3.3 @Granny Mokwena yes send her to Jail..been caught out 
1:08:02,1:09:24, @David Tuer I like the idea of We The People having power in every decision the state makes. while the country suffers @Dominic Przybylski Since when are the 1% governed by the same rules as us? They will never see the inside of a courtroom no matter what crimes they commit. no she is acting like she doesn't know Send her to jail in that J&B Durban July outfit "Plus I mean in what basis a rule 3.3 is issued? @derek main glad you think we should fix it... I believe the same. But fix it “so people like Malema can’t BS...” ? I’m more worried about the Markus Joosters of this world. Malema has way less power @strong together i believe you know better that most of the things we are using in today's life was developed by blacks 
1:09:27,1:10:03, @Granny Mokwena When somebody claims somebody else did something wrong. "to become an advocate u must be admitted to the Roll of Advocates Everybody is tired here....take Memela to jail.....judge to your chambers ....evidence leader to your private practice case closed now again "We are all equal in so far as the amount of time we have to enjoy life "@Botshelo Nkosi_Made yes But this..... no no no Here she comes. hoo....eish 
1:10:08,1:11:08, human person😀😀😀😀😀 exactly so speak the truth @Dominic Przybylski @Derek Main - To have a conscience you need a belief of what is right and what is wrong. Simple Hey? Human Person? she is actually implicating herself exactly she.wants.mercy Imbokodo... like the hair!! there comes thank you chair 
1:11:09,1:13:26, @Dirk vd Westhuyzen she thinks he is the same as those who kept quiet when the wrong was being done Think Miss Hoffmeyer needs a stress ball. @David Tuer Our society rewards psychopaths. So the very wealthy have those traits ie. no conscience and litlle idea of wrong and right. @Botshelo Nkosi_Made a lot of those people could do nothing except losing jobs its GPUs Now giving up. @Dominic Przybylski Then by extension I assume you don't worry about people that are extremely poor either. defeated you were the head at the time so yes it stops with you 
1:13:59,1:15:41, Shut the F up and answer the questions Mama just tell the truth.....It should be easier than trying to cover up any corruption. "@Michael Wild Yup @Derek Main I live very happily on R3500 per month. There are people who think that's too much and call me a privileged white. I'm not going to let them affect my happiness. Stronger together.....peanut butter????! I think she thought she was going to get there and say it was not me and go scot free. People are given positions and they forget that it takes accountability @Derek Main - So we are always going to be ruled by psychopaths and we may as well accept the status quo? @David Tuer sad but true I rule myself. If anybody else thinks they rule me that's their problem. 
1:15:45,1:17:15, @Derek Main the basic question is how can you allocate resources fairly in a society like this? @Dominic Przybylski I put it to you that that is impossible unless you are privileged (eg. you have paid for accommodation etc). the problem with this woman is that she is defensive instead of answering the questions Why did she not follow the commission when wrong doing was revealed about her. Point "I like you Dominic "ms mamela Because I "@Gabisile Mabuza well @Derek Main I own my own house. I pay R2000 per month for internet access and municipal tax. The rest goes on my other expenses. 
1:17:26,1:18:58, @David Tuer Not me - I'm not Dominic. I'm going to shout about it until the cows come home. I think society needs a reset - our values are all wrong. Psychopaths rule and that's got to change. exactly DCJ sick and tired of listening to this Concerned please stay focused on the subject and not generalise. otherwise turn of your electric devices. or we will send you back to the dark ages. @Dominic Przybylski R2000 is a bargain @Dominic Przybylski its an illusion. it is? you can certainly conclude that this lady has got something to hide @Derek Main Heh! I may be in some 1% but not the 1% you're talking about. 
1:19:03,1:20:17, meeeeeee @Dominic Przybylski what happens when the rand falls to R30/$? @Chosen One I don't have all the answers but I do feel we could do a better job and we should be talking about how. yoooooooh this woman @Dominic Przybylski do you think that won't affect you?

"Derek u are waisting time by talking bout waisting time ! @Dirk vd Westhuyzen my point exactly. @Dominic Przybylski says he rules himself. Miss Mbanjwa is putting her own client into the pit they are both digging "I see a liar T A SOCK IN IT Ms ega eagle But shame the lawyer has been consistent on fairness - but the evidence is led like she is guilty already or facts have been made.

"@Person of interest See that's where Dominic and I differ - I may be sitting pretty but if others aren't @Chosen One at ZAR 30 petrol will cost R 30 per liter "@Dirk vd Westhuyzen I ride a bicycle @Dirk vd Westhuyzen that will surely affect everyone. you are waisting about talking bout waisting time ... wow "I have the greatest respect always for the views expressed by @Derek Main and @Dominic Przybylski.

You were lucky😂 We were so poor we couldn't afford parents.... I've met many people in my lifetime and lived in many situations and the poorest people I've met are usually the happiest.

It is meaningful and traditional I'm a few minutes behind but it seems no one was looking after SAT or SAAT's interests but they all bent over backwards for the contracting party or parties. Am not evaluating credibility am not skilled to determine credibility........... All am saying is her evidence has been consistent and once she sticks to that her attorney will argue credibility the whole commission is a waste of time none of all these people would be arrested nor be held accountable for their crimes there's no where in the contract where it says cash must be payed upfront. Hhaha.. Hoffmeyer stinging 
2:40:00,2:41:29, No one in SAAT executors to protect thecpmpany Our frustration is that this should be in a proper court if the Hawks were competent.
