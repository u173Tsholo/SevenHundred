But he failed us as a county horrible "Criminals deserve to be jailed  Happy birthday to your daughter @MAHANKE TOLOKO 🎂🍭 I got the impression that zondo is afraid of Zuma. This swine steals from the south African people and he feels entitled Zuma must appear before the commission. Theres no way he mustn't account for his Crimes. His likes and those of Magashules have brought this country into a mess @Gaum also he will never have peace until the day he goes back to the dust that he is @Previous 😂

13:54,14:44, "What make people think he is scared  Who is paying Zumas legal fees? I hope it's not our tax money Scared where😶😶 Zondo is not scared at all "Like Al Capone that does not show any signs of being scared of Zuma Is he still receiving his state benefits from the tax payers. Zuma must come and give his side of the story this is a watershed moment do we live in a legal controlled state or political controlled state 
14:46,15:31, "Zuma no man is above the law few ppl are destroying anc zondo must just remove the previous title of president of that thieve from his mind and just see him as thd regular thieve that he is en summon.

Just Mr Zuma is enough arrested Who is Mr Zuma is it Duduzani or JZ "the old man has maintained that he wants his day in court in order to tell his side They will have to arrest him @ Zuma is being implicated in so many things. He needs to come and give his side of the story. If he doesn't give his side of the story then the judgment will be based on what has being heard. @rohan barnard Thanks. I heard them start. 
16:07,16:36, If He doesn't appera He will have to go answer in the COurt Of LAw it's going to be crZ problem in South Africa "@Valencia 34 witnesses have implicated him @Thabang Makama JZ "pretorius will be crucified for being white because he is arguing this very point now. watch the space.

I heard them start. @Lwazi swty what's the problem where is Pravin Capable of stealing man yes "Guys lets take it within ourselves to understand how the judicial system works. dnt b driven by emotions. the law says not guilty until proven "nothing is permanent Zuma’s none appearance will collapse the credibility of the commission set a precedent R800m wasted = failed state = ANC 1st & SA 2nd 
17:45,18:29, I think I heard in the commission that if the implicated person does not appear then the implications are taken to be true any one else remember that "if an ordinary citizen is summoned to appear in court @Asanda. Exactly. He is so capable that he can answer a few questions and prove himself mos:elbowcough: DCJ Zondo 54 Millions of South Africans are behind you... only ATM and Blf and AfM and Hlaudi voters are against you🤔... ATM won only 2 seats... Sleep well DCJ don't be bothered... Asandra you talking of some one from Wakandla not Zuma Just as I suspected... Bunch of JZ looters on the chat as well. guys this is not a court of law. lts not going to say Zuma is guilty or Innocent. It will only make recommendations which will be challenged in courts. Still a long way. Groundbreaking history that grandchildren will be told of - a day that SA was placed on the road of law and order. Respect Zondo @kulani clive Mabasa Busy fixing Eskom and other SOE's that the Zuma appointees destroyed. Hope that answers your question.

I will do my best🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ @mabasa call him and ask him where he is. How must we know where is Pravin. 
23:02,23:53, Zuma still thinks He’s untouchable "Zondo force him INTERPOL have been approached to issue an international warrant of arrest for A J Gupta. @Masonwabe Ndaba Read my response above "Adv. Pretorius "Yolo sharing state TS information to private citizens amounts to Treason 👮‍♂️ "The chair must force JZ to appear @pastor they don't want that truth 
23:56,24:23, they must promise him that he can sing mshini wam at the venue Maosnwabe Ndaba; Pravin to do what? was Pravin implicated by any witness? "I am from the EC @Russell no that delela is well placed lol @Rohan. Definitely not soft.

24:25,25:19, zuma just a criminal and he dont want the truth to be heard "He's untouchable yes "@Aylo @Aylo McField gives him time to fake his death like Watson Zuma is playing a delay tactics and he is using that loophole when the DCJ give him a date Zuma must go to court once and for all Zumba bragged he would like his day in court and he would implicate many people. Now he is dead scared. Man of straw. "Morning law abiding citizens remind Zuma that this is not Lithuli House He wanted to Lead the ANC and the Country at all cost and stole together with His friends. Now He is against the same country He wanted to lead! 
25:21,25:49, But Mr ZUMA can't remember. zuma has gwababa @Yolo More Zuma must go to jail once and for all ZUMA came to the Commission and Implicated People of being SPYS. Now he is implicated he is Running. Siees!! zondo today he is standing his ground @Blake Yogi there's just too many loose ends to that story @Heinz 😂😂😂😂 zuma always says that he wants his day in court but he means the opposite "just wondering why pravin gordan was not forced to come when he send an attorney to come and tell the commission that he is busy so he won't come 
25:53,26:47, all this for a man who said he wants his day in court. So whats the problem now @cl mi...

UBaba already has a doctors note for the 16th of November 2020 "Pravin will come 
27:26,28:27, Zuma was in prison before he fear to go back again "Thats right previously he said he is not scared of prison Exactly Pravin does not have 34 witnesses accusing him. Zuma has. Zuma is the clear issue Black on black shame @Valencia pointing a finger where is Pravin? @previous you must email the commission and ask them. why are people asking about Pravin while we are busy with Zuma? relax guys Pravin will also come and account. please don't change the subject 
28:28,29:00, Pravin has testified and is only left is for him is cross-examination the RET brigade is so concern about Pravin as if he was given a preferential treatment. please ask your old man to come to the commission we miss his jokes 🤣 Zuma has no respect for this commission and DCJ eff supporters crying for pravin shame "@Valencia J  The other leg of this problem is that his lawyers are still considering him as a PRESIDENT and not the FORMER PRESIDENT What is this obsession with Pravin Ghordan by Zuma supporters? He will. But what has Pravin got to do with this matter today? @mongezi xaba @Gala the detractors amongst us will always do what they are sent to do. 
29:00,29:57, but he must come Zuma have no respect for anyone but himself i would like commission to follow security leanership2010/2011(in free state provence!!) "pravin is also not above the law ubaba wa duduzane "@Previous no I'm serious. You can email them. I just don't have the email address but as a citizen you have thd right to email them. Not rude "@Akhonamandla Gala  zuma must come... or go directly tojail! Do not collect R2bil! @Valentia J indeed

Truth commission vs Zondo communication the butternut kingdom will fall due to a tsunami originating in a firepool "@Will Zuma loves to waste time. he will agree to come. but it will be one postponement after the other... sigh "the ""Pravin"" bregade is just following the eff rethotic. The pillar that says make as much noise about the ones we hate they should also talk about pravin 
31:54,32:22, it is his right to ask the chair to recuse himself if he not comfortable with him. people are not treated the same here @sizwe msibi it's about Zuma plz understand do not mix things The man must come and account. @Sidwell ANC made a huge mistake in 2007 to elect such a selfish person as a leader Zuma has the one who pass that commission to be there so he said he has the signature for Zondo to be there now Why the people who suppose to show examples to respect the law there the one who abusing the law?this Zumba is a really bad example im not sure if people kmow the difference between Pravin and Zuma's issues at the Commission. Its quite sad when South Africans want to defend corruption and criminal activities. Is it only me that's thikning DCJ is making excuses for butternut? talk Zuma now! that is the subject! or do you not undertand also

47:57,48:48, only stupid people can support Zuma. mthokozisi the chairperson is right "Pastor JJ  "there was a lot of information that was given out here but it seems like the commission has decided to only take what they want to use against the former president The joining of the dots @Rox LOL - he was their performing clown zuma must go and spend his remaining part of his life in jail. Amahandbhoyi "Thapelo 
48:53,49:36, SOUND PLEASE cruda gm His Excellency Mr PresidentZuma. Contradictions galore @Yolo More 😂😅I didn't. Not yet 😂🤦🏾‍♂️ But I'm seeing the question about your purported response 😂🥰 GM ALTA Zuma uses opportunities where law is lose and unclear to his advantage and buys more time. I see nothing wrong there. If you wish to get him fix the lops in law. He will do it over and over again it. zuma criminal lol "...Zuma's Government appointees were ordered to attend meetngs at the Gupta compound 
49:43,50:42, DCJ spin te webb💪 "Guys "Vytjie Mentor lied My side anyway "Zuma the Coward. Hee naledi on her way😁 @Previous infact he will be released an hour later due to I'll health. If Zuma doesnt go to commission to defend himself then Zondo has the right to assume all allegations against Zuma is true. Simple. Stata of caputure should give us something in return. It be fruitfull not frutless. 
50:53,51:30, Noted @ALTA 🙏🏾😅 "@Andy  This is a very smart Judge @colleen n thats the law "Colleen its deep zuma is implicated and he's going to jail this makhanda Pravin Gordon says Zuma must appear 1st. Then he wil com. There is nothing implicating Gordon.But Zuma is No.1 His age...typed error8 
51:35,52:12, indeed Mr Chair indeed We need statue of Zuma @Thobani Mkananda I wont respond anymore to your morning greetings.

But because he is a politician "Mr Zondo Zuma's foot print is on almost all acts of corruption in government departments

"A leader stays a leader. JZ is similar to Najib Razak No ways chair 
52:56,53:08, cruda agree Zuma avoided arms deal trial for 15 years.. does any1 think he wil com here or giv any answers??? Lol Zuma is actually smart for his pocket he (Zuma) said wants his day in court so why is he ducking and diving? They both have loyal followers "Asanda @ Colleen Arezio ​ The Commission will send the evidence to the NPA for criminal investigations. Asanda you a zuma supporter or did you loose your brains last night! How can Zondo ignore all these allegations 
53:12,53:39, you are just doing your job chair These narratives from the chair are so great. Zuma se gaat Zuma can't be forced to attend based on hear say gossip stories ... his name is all over but no conclusive evidence Zuma had over 15 years to prepare for his criminal trial. Zondo dont worry we are here for you. @Yolo More It's somewhat mean though to ignore my greetings 😂 But I'll understand. It's strange though 🥰 "It does not appear as if Mr Zuma approves of the seperation of powers between executive DCJ I can tell you exactly what happened.... ZUMA IS A THIEVING CONMAN! He is guilty of everything he is accused of! 
53:47,54:09, Why don't we ellect a Judge as a President next time around? "Zondo is captured Zuma does not want an oppurtunity.he wants to com later and say he was not given an oppurtunity to giv his side All Zuma's dirty laundry is being aired 🙂 It is going to make him & his counsel very happy (well I'm sure there's plenty more!). Time for orange overalls Zuma!! please please do your job Chair PresidentZuma will prevail again A sabpoena will get him to the commission simple. Chair - we hear you. Logical - every reasonable person agrees with you. I am not the Formr President Supporter but am worried our anger results in us improperly applying the law. 
54:10,54:30, government of ex convicts that's why they steal This monolog was for JZs benefit. I hope he got the message "we can't be treating someone special here "the former pres. is a mafia am sorry to hurt anyone's feelings zondo 4 President implicated by 34 witnesses..lol..and zuma says Zondo has an agenda..hahahahha Fake doctors note. "Thank you block button there we go 
54:37,54:47, Henrique Botha what is your understanding of conclusive evidence @ Henrique Botha ​ Zuma can't said to be clean. 34 witnesses against him. Kgmotso. Agreed kulani shame on you! (hopefully) you will get brains (in time) Zondo extremely methodical and thorough. Zuma has no leg to stand on day in court..for public consumption..guilty man will look for excuses..never admits his wrongdoing "This man has crippled our economy Zuma is big trouble 🤷🤣🤣 The wheels of justice grinds very slowly in SA - but it is now grinding a bit faster. 
54:53,55:07, Zuma has Ace and Pravin has Mr president who is going to win? "@Jabu Malinga You're right its now or never @rohan 😂😂 summons are on the way wether he likes it or not Zuma was only one of the major players. The tendering system needs to be rehauled.

Soon Zondo will be our Chief Justice "Asanda I think Zuma is going to commit sewage pipe. 
56:14,57:04, Thing is; the “I don’t remember” trick won’t work this time we mst hv special court to deal with ppl like Zuma only PresidentZuma is loved by the nation. he is afraid that he is going to EXPOSE himself more of a joke let alone the allegations... hence Humiliation in his letters 🤔🤔 @Aubrey De Bliquy He understands little about that separation. He was excited to learn about subjudicá and abused it 🤣 Morning his lawyers mislead It's Friday Harks in action Surely this duo are building up their position in getting Zuma into the commission. DCJ will come with a verdict soon zuma is common thief 
57:05,57:31, @ALTA Madonsela brushed of comments of becoming the first female president. She said we need to focus on getting the right one first. Now that is presidential material "He is not taking nonsense Mr Zuma. This is the Corruption Olympics and you are the official Flag Bearer. Please come and honor us with your presence.

They have objected to certain questions and that dealt with one by one "Why are they so obsessed with Zuma the Rubicon rubric 
1:22:53,1:24:11, @phumeza of course every criminal must be given the same as politicians @Phumezo jijana That's why I'm vehemently yet respectfully opposed to what Prof. T Madonsela is suggesting. the foundation is zuma..

All the laws should've been updated in '94 and beyond. How can we in 2020 rely on laws of the '40's? it just doesn't make sense! @James Dreamer we see as non lawyers the reasons for recusal have to be much greater than a harsh question or two "video link won't work the old man is full of tricks "@bongile sango  lekker!

Rita Gordan asked to be excused because of government commitments 'assist you ' lol 
1:25:27,1:26:16, uBaba..uBaba..where art thou.. if the vice President of that time is as clean and transparent as we understand why did he expose corruption that took place for 9 years. now he is willing to come and testify "@James Dreamer  @bangile sango 🤔 hawu! @ Vuyo sono 🤣🤣🤣 I thought Adv Skhakhane was mighty brave he will come and face the music for uBaba kanti lutho nje... amagwala Don’t persecute the African Leader i dont recall pravin being implicated..

1:29:34,1:30:08, KG Kagiso You were killed in the pst if you worked with a white man. This is why Zuma will never work with bo Oppenheimer & Ruperts.. "JZ delayed his fraud & corruption case he’s now delaying to appear before state capture. He’s 78 years old now @Singi Mathebula he's simply the red herring the ANC/EFF use to distract attention "a directive carries a criminal sanction @rohan barnard even 5G Booooooopha!!!! the ANC as a whole has failed the citizens of this country. Zuma should have worked with WMC to make sure that they get 100% ESKOM SAA & Gov business. We all do that!! @Gina deW There is only ONE Lordship Motseneke!!!!!😃 
1:30:08,1:30:57, @Jenny Whitewaves Zuma is basing his argument on precedent already set with witnesses said to be in his camp yho yho yho "Judge Zondo is right Khwezi is smiling wherever she is...
