"I think she’s been groomed on Q/A by lawyers felix there is no school here Money was delivered to a Sandton hotel in Checkers plastic bags I don't think Ms Viljoen realises how much trouble she is in. @Felix Muyoba i think she did shes just playing dumb and acting as a victim According to Markides court testimony 
10:16,14:46, "@Felix Muyoba  she cant run a business without knowing what is happening.. "Do the research Viljoen thinks she's an ANC MP ROFLMAO @Thulani Bukani There is an article in Citypress called : How to rop off a bank and lender the money *rip school time "This women is one if the three main implicated 
15:13,18:53, @magda you the mastermind is a founder of stealing the money from VBS Interesting analogy @Magda. You remind me of Bitcoin and Blockchains. The Namibia Sun also has lots of info on this case Are you listening Shamila! she has to repay back the money..she is already a bankrupt person.. She has since emigrated to the USA guys yhooo "@Magda Seguin 
18:54,20:41, ziyabila Koreneka will have to pay back the money to SAX ya sax NW province money laundering at its best. Can we believe her that she did not know all the implications of her actions. Has she made a deal with the Hawks which allowed her to emigrate to the USA? I wanted to download the news links but is unable to Hey Magda..... you should collaborate with Pieter- Louis Myberg and write a book as well.... Ignorance won't save her nor the owner of Koreneka "She has some nice model pics 
20:55,22:51, Keep America and Israel Great "This woman has been one of the ""hard working business entrepreneurs"" we have in this country! Might be filthy rich! Not lazy like you @Magda Seguin  Robert I used to do forensic medical investigation in my work Africa Rise Yep Keith we live from month to month bru Then even more so..... write a book.... magda Republic of South Africa is a company registered here in USA. So she can be held liable on conditions NPA files a case. him or her.. Some people hire cyber experts to cache their information or make it invisible on Cloud 
22:56,23:55, Capitalism will fall A deal with the devil.. she was supeoned therefore she is compelled to give evidence "Why the so called ""Hard working rich people"" nowadays are likely to be either in drugs Thanks for the heads up Robert now they got her she must confess The Spectre of Communism is haunting Africa Communism have already failed We don't want socialism it leads to a failed state.. this is socialism 
24:41,26:25, It will defeat the Capitalist monster once more Trump victory 2020 There is a nice graph on Republikein: 'Hoe hulle geplunder het' it gives a graph with the pics of the 3 main implicated if which she is one Capitalism must fall @Cerebis That may be true but capitalism is not doing too well either. Something has to change. Or fake hard worker @Magda Seguin AFMS got 79.8m Namibian dollars @CJ30 X I agree with you - capitalism is a system that rewards sociopaths. @Born free Impossible for Trump to win in 2020 
26:28,27:51, The Capitalist will sell us the rope in which we will use to hang them capitalism means someone has to be poor CJ30 X It wasn’t Capitalism that bribed Zuma into Russian power plants built in SA @Derek Main Pure Capitalism is pure evil....Rich getting richer..... "@Born free See what happened in December  Trump will win that's a fact @clive oconnell But it is the nature of the beast. Trump victory 2020. @Born free Whats your rationale to reach that conclusion? 
28:01,29:55, Bribery and State Capture is based on this failed system called Capitalism the reason why these business close down is because they are illegal @Born free Trump is the confirmation that Anybody can become the POTUS.

31:37,32:53, @CJ30 X Not true......The ANC has no idea of what Capitalism means....SACP.......Are Gucci Comrades...EFF is Zimbabwe and Venezuela blind followers I don't think Trump can trust his military advisers. He has to trust his own instincts @Born free Holy c**p! You sound just like ANC members defending Zuma. This is money bridging like electricity bridge "@viva padrepio Trump inherited a solid economy in the making Trump is unhinged.... isn't it scary that there is no one to stop him from pushing the big N button????? @viva padrepio If only it were just national security - you lot spread your violence across the planet.
