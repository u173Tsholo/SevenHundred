3:05:05,3:07:33, A round of Applause to the Honourable Evidence leader.. things will be interesting "@T G Swartlane and ""Swartlane"" is better? Please" That Muthambi was arrogant. I am not surprised she decided not to avail herself for the PSC meeting. Honest people were done in by the Zuma faction The Chairman is so quiet. I hope he ain't missing anything. We want a strong heavy report here They must give her her money....Tyhini!!! In 2009 Joel Nemathetze lol. said damage Zuma is doing will take more than 50 yrs Sorry for mispell
