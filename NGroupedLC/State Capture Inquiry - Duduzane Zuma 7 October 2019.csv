13:22,16:19, 🕡 Waisg time with rebbish🕓🕓🕓 @Derek Main remember that Zuma is a business shareholder in his own right and a businessman hence he can bring any lawyer he wants. For that matter is not bending for anyone my leader. hi In which company is Zuma a shareholder? Judge should not entertain objections question must be asked without fear or favor Jacob you make no sense Nelson Musoliwa. you so right Duduzane owns an IT company @Mzalwane @Jacob Selematsela I don't recall saying anything the number of lawyers he has - but I will say that an honest man doesn't need a lawyer. I was just wondering what he does for his blessers. 
16:36,17:28, 🙆🙆😊😊but...... @i am free "Zuma is a shareholder in the SA economy @Mzalwane Mzala He is a chair holder I thought the reference was to JZ. Dudzane is a crook - like father like son. lol Chair Holder "@ Mzalwane Mzala we are interested to know '@deon meyer 😂 What did Duduzane do..? 
17:36,20:59, lawyers there to keep witness out of trouble. if you are a Zuma always plenty trouble hold chairs for blessers he was at gupta house Duduzane Did relationships with the dodgy Gupta’s do he has to answer for such relations Is Gupta house a Government House...? We all know full well that JZ just uses Dudzane as a front. He's a token businessman. "Haaibo Vincent Vilakazi "The Confidence by this guy the Zuma family always shrug and say. what was wrong with working with the Gupta's? explain this....why did the Gupta's run away and hide.... 
21:27,23:05, this boy is elegant and confident... is it regarded as crime in SA meet the Gupta? Where are these Guptas..? lol Zuma gives me classy Skrrr Skrrr vibes Nice way to start the week. I look forward to hearing Mr Zumas version of events. this must go to jail "Hai but Duduzane is hottt mahn if the Gupta's at innocent why di they run to Dubai Very strange cos the Guptas are actually friends to the ANC and all the Presidents of the ANC has worked with them 
23:31,25:00, the want home. crikey there was no bolt of lightning we he took the oath @Tee Makara That is why ladies who were sent by the DA to protest against him ended up taking selfies with him outside court. @Jacob Selematsela Yes - that's because the entire ANC is corrupt to the core. we have Daddy's boy today yoh Yes yes @jane who are yu asking agree why waisting more money on the swine "@Mzalwane Mzala hai shame I don’t blame him 
25:15,26:05, "@Mzalwane Mzala hai shame I don’t blame him Hahaha "@Mzalwane Mzala hai shame I don’t blame him that't correct @Derek Main you really seem to have so much corruption evidence against anyone else. why dont you go and give evidence at the corruption????? your father was there and you were also there you are rotten Like dogs on heat. @Jacob Selematsela I don't need to - it's all coming out anyway. Hhayibo weNja 
26:39,28:07, corrupt ANC everything said yes he's father said i forgott @Johan Peens True that - they are beyond saving. "Oh he recalls Am sure the ladies are not hearing the content they will have to ask what happened after the evidence submitted 😂😂😂 Corruption runs in the Zuma family I’m just drooling over Duduzane there is still people who vote for the ANC shame "Tee Makara 
28:14,29:06, duduzane is just so bae though "@abinetoshumba That's why there's over 3 curruption runs to all that have an opportunity not only Zumas Tee. Close your legs he is so cute @Mrs Anderson aowa shame hott is hottt Johan Peens according to you who should people vote for and why? Dudzane only has eyes for the Gupta brothers. O pequeno Mozambicano on stand😀😀😀😀 
29:20,31:16, @I Am Free is difficult close to impossible "Just by admitting the meeting happened and at the Gupta's residence he used muti rotten to the core all the Anc government derek main yu seem to knw every1 dt is corrupt at ANC yet yu still making noise here why dnt yu take yo info to d officials The guy look so innocence that i wish he can just say Sorry SA i will never do it again @MCEBISI MBUSI are you related to Mcebisi Jonas?? this commission is a waste of time "lol 
31:22,33:07, @Samkelo Nxele I don't need to - the evidence is all coming out anyway. mbuso ndlovu 😂😂 Mcebisi are both the name but my surname is Mbusi and the other name is Jonas that's correct this boy is too educated for this crap.. he is going to out class them.. which of the Mrs Zumas is his mother? he is as thick as a plank stupid swine @Kagiso Mathole i echo your sentiments my leader. What do you mean this crap ? 
33:10,34:05, @mbuso Ndlovu no this boys doesn't just say yes.. @mbuso Ndlovu no "The puppy eyes don't fool me @MSFviewer his mother is late - Kate Mantsho.. @MSFviewer his mother passed away correct agree with you waisting tax money on pig @ Humani Duncan they all are 
34:09,35:43, i see you @Vuyisile Ngesi and @makhosi nobhatyi Thanks at least he can read why does Zuma senior pleads por poverty while he has a billionaire son? he had no mother he was born from a pig lets see if he find page 735 Him and the father have mastered lying like sport. "@Johan Peens Yes! he found the page! 
36:13,37:41, Duduzane might be regarded as a crook but he was not born a crook his father stupidity played a big role in his untoward behavior "We paid for him to get rich(Tax) "in south africa the richer gets away with everything Yes Johan. Definitely offensive to say the least.. Ordinary members of the ANC have no access to Luthuli House for their private meetings. agree with you intellectual thug n criminal dd belong to jail its bit there s blind people here who ar not working but saying this guy s hot while we suffer bcos of this pple reckless behavior n doing good curry there He conducted many meetings at the Guptas on almost a daily basis - wow 
38:00,39:49, i wanted to conduct it at the Gupta's not at my house The evidence leader seems nervous.... he is a shareholder and partner of Guptas so yes one part makes sense to have meeting there. but the Hotel should be the preferred venue. I can't believe this is offspring of Zuma... lock him up let him then defend himself in a court off law He can't dodge this one. is he drinking Gin? lie water 
39:53,40:30, What is he drinking? What is he drinking Is this Jacobs son agree in s@t now This session wont go far..narrative been pushed here. Gin Lol like father like son It looks like Gordon’s dont know will have to ask his mother 
40:34,41:10, he is drinking muti @Johan Peens lock him up for what now? has he been found guilty of any wrong doing???? He feels like he’s entitled Thad’s alcohol I bet you The contempt written all over it's face...Obviously he knows something nobody else does. do you see the advertising? ...This is the non-responsiblity-guy that was driving the car that killed person(s) and no one was charged for it in Africa. He must have super law avoidance powers. Audio? he neatly placed it so it shows the name.. Pretty fancy water bottle 
41:12,42:17, Guptas residence is his house...hahaha He started lying ngoku "@Ryan SA free advertising @Ryan SA what kind of water that is drinkinh duduzan Surely they wouldn’t allow alcohol there was that mouth wash🤤 He probably has a deal with the water company.. he is a Zuma he is allowed to drink anything 
42:20,43:15, He has water rights he is drinking water is fancy bottle 🤔🤔🤔🤔 looks lik a gin bottle..heheheheh.. zuma laugh is Gin guys ďubai water That is the water from the SANGOMA whatching live from #Zoar #Kannaland #WesternCape #SouthAfrica yes Dubai water well say 
43:17,44:51, So far what matters is that he confirmed the meeting at Gupta residence the rest is up for graps Lol Dubai water @Walls.. Haters just hate this young fine well behaved gentleman Uyalazi isela xa sele libhaqiwe libonakala limsulwa kodwa ngaphakathi kulo yingcuka He chose a place of his choose guys. is like choosing a toilet room in a public toilet. No nid to justify that. No.. agreed... he is a fine young gentleman.. but Duduzane is baeable shem. and MCM👌 ooh eina 
45:24,46:40, duduzame does not know anything about it!!!! I just cannot believe that a mashini 'wam singing guy is his father.. twang this man us a liar not even an accent.. Wow.. So many ignorance among people funny his asking the question now so he is now asking questions he is a snack 
46:59,48:39, "he sounds like he has many ""paler skinned friends""" first lie Let us not worry about his character. The questions asked have nothing to do with him as a person but to link it to purpose and suspicion of state capture. All questions are relevant for commission. What's up with the fancy bottle of water? lyk father lyk son. I think it will help the Counsel to stop making suppositions and to present facts otherwise he is going to come across as if he does not know his story If you are pure like Angels are you can cast a stone khalidntokozo ???? Cyril is done if nobody goes to jail 
48:52,51:25, if I look at him.. I don't see a Zuma.. "Let us not worry about the water container. It does not give us answers and proof of state capture. The agenda is state capture not water bottle Why would all these people lie about the presence of Guptas in these meetings?He even went to an extent of arranging a meeting between the Guptas and Ramathlodi. I agree with you Ryan "@junior jones We eat carry that is what I know about Saxonworld #mbalula So he just jumped 😂 straight faced liar!! arrogance of his father 
51:33,52:37, "Simphiwe Mkhatshwa I was also puzzled by what Jonas said The accent clearly correspond with that bottle... what did you drive that this guy just wanted to drive with you not knowing where he is going? "numbers challnegd like his father "@Norma Mzimela even a 7year old will ask I thought Duduzane would read Fana Hlongwane's evidence to the PP. So Jonas jumped not knowing where he was going??? "But Zuma has older sons "Zuma has big balls 
52:40,54:35, that is a lie Am chilled Mrs. Anderson. I was just correcting something that has nothing to do with what is investigated. I want us to look and listen to facts that will prove state capture not water. @Tshwane Yamošate yes my 4 year old asks where are we going mommy. Mr Fana evidence will bang Dudu here I can imagine Fana jumping into the Merc... flying like Siperman Jonas knew that they were going to meet Fana Hlongwane. The actual venue would have been not that important "We are listening Who received a call? Duduzane ro Jonas? surely that should be easily verifiable! so very well spoken and highly intelligent .I love him so so much . 
54:38,57:17, Duduzane has no business deal except government? focus on the theme guys. why was this young man chosen as an organiser for this vital meeting. Very calm lawyer we are behind you duduzane ...we know that who is conspiring all this # white monopoly capitalist why is he making sure the water bottle lable faces to the front "arrogant the water is to help with his temper "Thumbs up Duduzane...well responded to the majority of questions you have being asked the inmates in prison are going to enjoy this criminal 
57:20,58:47, "@Giovanni Redcliffe there are 4658 pweople watching so  "Lol @A Am free. sounds like the live chat chairperson Duduzani is hinding some information "liar agree with you lol interesting lying with a straight face. a thief wil never admit that he stole . always giv a story Dudu is going to be in high demand when he goes to jail. 
58:58,1:00:35, "But the content of the meeting was handled by the Guptas and not Duduzane. A young man arranging a meeting for older people drink some water my boy lol 😀 Why was this crook even in the meeting. "This boy is so likeable do drink Gin must be toooo nice He has this superior expression on his dial Lex has brain damage 
1:00:37,1:01:13, at lest his not coughing like dad who ever believes WMC exists lacks intelligence Drinking Gin @Rob Nel He has a model C attitude So did uncle Fana ask his mchana to arrange this meeting so did mchana do it out of the goodness of his heart? hes lubricating his lies with the contents of that bottle its blue top. we call it cane agree @skeetpetegibbs Are you insulting me? 
1:01:27,1:02:07, Mainstay holy water "Mholweni to those who are watching. keeep it up is that even water though? Thank you judge More like royal water Give him a lecture DCJ "To quote Judge Judy - ""If it doesn't make sense duduzani is black excellence as black people we are proud that he is succesful like this and we know that the white monopoly capitalist are threatned 
1:02:09,1:02:57, Makes no sense at all criminal criminal--------yaah coooool criminal He sips his water every time a difficult question is asked like dad. @Ta Ras I don't think he's that stupid to be drinking uncle Fana..lol..ubaba duduzane Did he use his fathers status to push the agenda. This a.. holes are playing with us. Nothing makes sense here By the way what was his business before his father became a president? "Natural Karma shall lead. the Power of the Creator never fails. have Mercy to the poor and lets take charge of our minerals. the poor gets poor more 
1:03:33,1:05:15, @AnneM .. perheps so. The Zuma’s are not guilty of anything. If they had committed any crimes the establishment would’ve locked them up long before Jacob even became a president Soooo.....we know he is drinking water...so why is the content of bottle advertised on it 🤔 Could it be that it is not as advertised? "Anyone else have that Adele song playing ""Roumer has it"" in their head?" shame if you belief that then there is no hope for you 35 Zuma serior should be ashamed for involving his son in all this corruption and crime. 21 This boy had powers vested in him by his father 
1:05:16,1:05:50, Zuma senior "shouldn't Duduzane be given time His cute thou in 2015 h0 agree send the swine to prison the im Born 1984 - makes him 35 Corrupt to the core!!! sins of the father... Cute gonna go down well in prison 
1:06:20,1:07:07, "we can be fooled "Actually an 'unknown' guy would be better for Meditation I think "why all the hating for this smart young guy  Madumetja Moagi Why? "ll 000 they waiting for him it is arranged Who is his mother? in 2015 how old was he ?how come can he became the mastermind of al meetings "sins of the father 
1:07:14,1:07:45, The hate ppl of this country have the Zumas is worrying shemm Whoever thinks that the Zumas will 1 day go to jail must have their heads examined @I Am Free are you saying people will follow zuma junior if he comes clean? "Because Duduzane is the son of former president Jacob Zuma "Its too early There is no point in persecuting this little man. All of us would have done what he did. He is just an ordinary hustler who happens to have had a dad who was a prez. I get the commissioner now Why does it matter that it was Duduzane and not anybody else who arranged the meeting what did young lad do? 
1:07:49,1:08:37, @andre du plessis......take ur pick Ola mfanakithi batshele my lytie..lol..this guy is soo fake Zondo says “Yes” too much laaitie go home Why is that guy saying Yes all the time "'these sorts of meeting happen ALAL the time"" don't you understand chair silver tongue How do you speak to a friend who goes around talking nonsense about you. Zondo and this lawyer are beginning to come across as if they have never done that. Nonsense 
1:08:41,1:09:36, what did he do How on earth could you support someone like him! Looters chairperson... "Zuma must go "That commision is waist of money funny to see all the crook defenders eish.....waste not waist Duduzani way too cunning and street smart for this commission "@Madumetja Moagi I agree 
1:09:42,1:11:14, already 300 million is gone these people committed treason @Fish Phineas That money could have been used to build many RDP houses. The local constable could have arrested whoever has to be arrested 300mil waisting tax money nothing will happen agree @Rudi Haywood Young man is choking himself with lies And these lawyers are just here to pocket money tea break agree 
1:11:20,1:12:18, bye everyone bye ...Royalty is empowering corruption. xxxxm this boy is going to show this lawyer flames "@Mangalani Mangalani probably bye Chairperson mr A Am Free how much is tea This commision must stop calling the people to come and answer the question because some question are so useless 
1:13:23,1:15:39, @Rudi Haywood I can tell you he is beginning to regret availing himself. Why not have meeting in his house. Why a stranger organising a meeting for two friends. "Duduzane is not a fonkong @Thabiso Lehloo . Duduzane is taking the commission along nicely. In total control and crusing The Zumas are the least of this countries problem "Thx @Mangalani Mangalani The Zumas caused the problem! "Our problem is prejudice Another problem is people that support these crooks @Madumetja Moagi DZ is clutching BUT adv Mokoena is factual 
1:15:45,1:19:20, hatred and anything related to that won't solve any of the problems we facing @thando what mess you are a mess... You people voted for them and then they steel from you ja this laaitie is one of the clever ones also billionaire His a baehhhhhhhhhh corruption is okay as long as it serves the purpose of defeating WMC! "@Damaking Alie If you can't see the mess "All this comments are not based on what the actual evidence are but on mere Media and Gossip hype are we listening to a case of kidnapping here ? why are we waisting time? 
1:19:22,1:20:34, "@Derek @I Am Free just trying to get a grip on the underlying need to defend Duduzane duduzane must be a very a talented businessman @Thando Nkutha I am referring to the people defending and supporting these crooks @Zama Kubheka nepotism is awesome!

2:09:09,2:09:50, @Zamokuhle Zwane I also don't get what they want from him bafuna asabe? Like Father Like Son and 702 fools what time it will resume? "When a person is not saying what you're expecting or what you want to hear not convinced with his answers Trying to be someone he is not. lol "He is confident "But DZ is asking valid questions 
2:10:01,2:11:34, This must be Ubaba's favorite son!!!!! these is not prosecution time it is just an inquiry. If phone transcript can be put into these inquiry DZ would faint. Deep waters ahead I am with you Mr Mokgopa this zuma thinks he knows watch the space you will hear. @Mvuzo Vundhla 😀😀😀😀😀yes they want him to say what they want not his truth or the way things happened. wrong lawyer for the day. he looks afraid to. mvuzo u hv said a true I see stupidity in him. "@Trust Muzanya The problem is that he is going against his friends & 'enemies'. His version is against the Guptas & Jonas. So Zondo is getting gatvol now 
2:11:39,2:12:50, @Luntu Jonginamba Don't be fooled by the advocates calm voice. He is a very sharp advocate. @MrTpma2009 DZ is already in deep problem This guy Zuma is so arrogant. contradicting him self seconds apart shammmmmmmmm. i think the boy have balls the young man is smarter than the legal team lol @Anne M. I fully agree with you. I think the beeeeeg one will come soon He's even contradicting his uncle Fana @Eric Singo. this boy is a charmer 
2:12:51,2:13:49, I like his confidence "People stop the hating for this young wonderful man  @Anne M. I'm waiting to see more of that from him. Menzi he is a fool. AW Nxamalala madoda. aw wena KaLugaju "Yip Duduzane is being hostile in a polite matter. @Talia Owen You must be a 30%er. @Thabang Oliphant Lolest

2:14:38,2:15:24, I think the fool see another fool @Mlamuli Makhula How is he beating them contradicting everyone including 'his friends' "@Luntu Jonginamba There's a saying the evidence leader is slippin and taking the DCJ down wit him @Michael Michael but his asking valid questions he was not involved early reports or affidavit People tend to mistake confidence with arrogance. The young man is just confident 😂😂 This why I was looking forward to Duduzane Zuma appearing. The kid has his gloves on she...Pretoria Boys High produced a fighter. he had enough time to reherse his lies @Mvuzo Vundhla DZ is arrogant and stupid! 
2:15:50,2:16:56, "Rich I meant gloves off shem... when was he at PBHS? "The Guy is very smart This guy is a Genius @eric Singo he's not stupid. I mean they expected him to speak for Jonas and he posed the same question to them Menzi he dont need to prove weather he is better dan the advocate.but to be accurate with his answers. @menzi zimele it sounds like that probably due to his fluency but he's not a lawyer. most of the questions are actually curved balls set to ensnare him in the latter stages. @Joburg CEB Lion I agree. 
2:17:01,2:19:58, @Siyabonga Mchunu So DZ is a product of WMC? Humility never pays the bills... "I saw a meme last week that says that what we see as flies "Adv Mokoena'' So he (mcebisi) says that he was offered R600m in that meeting  Michael Michael true!👍 @Mlamuli Makhula No they expected him to dispute Jonas and agree with the Guptas. But he is disagreeing with the Guptas and Uncle Fana Hlongwana. Zondo has no choice but to find against him! Heather he must be lucky bcz this is not court of law I love this smart young intelligent man "They only work on each others verdions 
2:20:00,2:21:03, what has gone on. Is he lying like his father following another Oscar Pistorius coached to lie duduzane for president 😂 Owen really intelligent??????????? Duduzani is owning them so far😁 what's his job? this kid lies Duduza Ishmail Zuma.....lol 
2:21:17,2:21:42, @Itumeleng Motse looting the state wow I am truly getting to you guys I love that His arrogance will be his downfall because he is not thinking and not listening the line of questioning. Duduzane was just following his parents instruction.....you must respect your father Really @Masoul Mt Morse he is a businessman. Eric...lol. what was the meeting all about.. DZ is demonstrating outstanding intelligence 
2:21:47,2:22:39, Saying nothing also lead to poor credibility as a witness "defensive genius Duduzane think he is smart with his useless version.Subsequent events will prove that Duduzane is lying especially the dismissal of Mr Nene. selective memory this one Really @godfrey wasarira don't lie cheeseboy phone transcript will shock you DZ "is duduzani in the accompany of jz for moral support 
2:22:40,2:24:25, this boy is very intelligent like his father Like his Father its not intelligence.its stupidity Like father like son ✊✊ @Setlabosego Lucky ....compared to urself? i take it that jz is gonna sinf mshini wam after today's hearing Setlabosego lucky: intelligent or cunning? people are not intelligent if they get caught out Zuma Senior has short-distance intelligence

Wantlatsasaan Keith Din if it was cool what u want him to say He is streets ahead of his father... @keith your favorite will go to jail too Guys you are quick to judge DZ How judge will sort out what Jonas said against this sophisticated witness will be a wonderment to me. @Immanuel You forgot how South Africans think and behave. They have voted and praised Zuma as a people's president in 2014... and i luckily i didn't 
2:27:07,2:27:59, Funny that even stupid people are still intelligent and intelligent people are still stupid.... @sfiso u slow to judge DZ "Thembekwa Makwe:You just looking at the handsomeness "@Setlabosego Lucky Who's ""my favourite""???"

2:40:54,2:42:10, @Teboho Ntshalong lool😂 "The white cabal thought DZ will suffer oesophagus broken English cancer..dude is not clearing his throat like daddy "Tebogo its not about speaking English fluently or looking handsome @Keith Din ..look at the global military bases and grasp the reality of what is. @Anne M. their on a 10min break @Gcina Mkhize Except if he was ducking and diving and not making himself available. @Lee Hendrix i meant syntax and semantics That's not according to his version set top boxes. rest of the world is digital. sabc stil using arials..hahhahahah..corruption multichoice monopoly 
2:42:38,2:43:58, @Maruping Mosimanewakgomo how do you know if he has been telling the truth or not?? Shut Up!!🙄 @I Am Free They think they have done nothing wrong...like his corrupt dad The lad is so confident. He applied for coming to face this commission which was initiated to discredit and humiliate his family's name. Bravo 👏👏 @Gcina Mkhize They're back. I can see the picture but there's no sound. DZ is a man enough to face this inquiry..atleast he did to fake his death like your stupid Gavin from Bosasa is this guy kok eyed? cross eyed @Keith Din..sound reasoning eliminates products of postulation. @Mvuzo Vundhla Even Agrizzi came across in the same way and look at what a criminal he is. Duduzane is just as guilty. 
2:44:07,2:45:02, were is that file Duduzane Zuma is doing just fine💪 what is ZONDO looking for? @Anne M. refresh your page "I was not wrong to withdrew my vote from ANC in 2014.

Like father like son? Is ignorance (angazi) a haritable trait? "For them @Megan Lacey Comfort break @Megan Lacey ...they've handcuffed DZ ready to take him to prison "@Derek Main The morning i thought about putting an X next to Zuma 
2:46:45,2:48:29, @Maruping Mosimanewakgomo define arrogance and tell me how it connects with what I said? "This guy is trying very hard to exonerate himself from all allegations Are they still getting comfortable? Maybe the aircon is still not working 🤔 "@I Am Free hOW's Tyger V? Cold and cloudy this side @Keith Din I also had the same thought but my ballot paper jumped up and slapped me. 😀 DZ is going to deny these allegations...lol I hope n pray dt he succeeds not @Damon Radebe: How can you say I must shut up when all i said we interested in was to know the truth?I didn't say that he is not telling the truth. "@Jerry Moreo All of them 
2:48:32,2:50:52, he is laughing @Derek Main Hahaha! That ballot did a right thing!!! he is not sure How could this Jonas steps inside the car going to a meeting with Mr Zuma and not knowing where is the meeting going to be held??? "They always says This meeting did not take place too....can you check yourself lol there is a problem in the commission Same as those who vote the current one oh snap 
2:51:00,2:51:39, @Phyllis Kumalo lol he's denying everything DCJ excellent ...IF the Guptas stole Trillions in USD from Africa and the Zumas comforted then why is there no expression of discomfort from the Zumas? hehe..d chair got him "@Damon Radebe even a 1 month old baby will ask this guy is crazy chair is helping rich boy.he waz there Did you know that J. Zuma is the one who suggested the Chair as Deputy Chief Justice? 
2:51:41,2:52:29, Why is the Judge leading him and answering for him?????? "Whether the truth or not @Maruping Mosimanewakgomo we are interested in both the truth and also being clear in telling the truth which requires him to fluent enough in english so he can be understood clearly Thank you for your sharpness judge Zondo "the zumas got few million I think we've just had a Gotcha moment 😆 " @Tshwane Yamošate most definitely "2009

2:54:26,2:55:40, The chairman is being fair as always. But BASOP his fairness. @Damon Radebe: point taken but in future just have some tolerance with other people's views which differs with yours and never tell people in public to shut up because you assume they differ with you @keith Din. We cant vote for Apartheid DA we are fine with the ANC. Unless DA changes 🛡👀🏹 Go Fish ¿ Here we go again 🙄🙄🙄 @Mathafeng Innocent Ntjanyana nomaindia Judge Zondo is a wise man! "2012 @Yolo More.
