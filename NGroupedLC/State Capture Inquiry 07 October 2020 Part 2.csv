9:38,12:05, A friend of mine was s scentenced to 19 years for cooking the books to the tune of R2.4mill. 🦊 How can these scentences be so different? "Peet I see the ANCYL says that he is being sidelined to facilitate WMC. Here we go again. Always somebody else's fault. @Peet venter. tjo😱. I see truter of VBS bank heist received 7 years exactly agree peet and simmy This is a low energy witness. @Peet Venter I understand this is part of a deal he testifies against others and gets alight sentence 
12:25,14:12, Low energy witness😂😂😂😂 "Jenny @Nomkhosi Zulu .. uck! i do think ace pants are shivering now All those VBS Crooks must be jailed. 7 years seems too little for stealing old people's savings? "ATLA  I suspect Ace Magashule was interviewed by the Hawks and did not do well so this could be the cause of all the panic. no no my apologies I'm just watching but I now and again press by mistake. my sincere apologies With due respect this witness waffling. 
14:18,16:54, yah simmy ace is involved thats my opinion "if u steal small amount of cash of course u will go 2 jail for a long time "I dont think Ace is panicking  @cerebis Truter took a plea bargain 10 years with 3 years suspended. he must have showed remorse as well. 😉@ATLA Steal millions you walk free steal a loaf of bread you get jail time "But where did Sodi got R500 jongi... friends @Bantu Sodaba OK Thanks for that info.

Hes not short of cash these people must pay back the money before they go to jail "@Mathapelo @Jongi Cayalli It baffles me. Mr. Truter oversaw the looting investments of the poor at VBS but he gets a mere 7 years sentence. the jail is only to vote anc out Sodi used his ill-gotten cash to pay his bail. Bizzare 
17:57,18:51, @Nomkhosi Zulu It's okay for you to say F..k Pastor has gone for prayers mathapelo sodi got more money than we can count ok 😍🖒ALTA Sodi must have given his lawyers money in advance just incase I don't want to be exited of something like this.Thye can be realised tomorrow for not enough evidence after elections.This is game of life hahahahaha Wim I believe they should have freeze also bank accounts @wim louw let's not speak his name 🤣🤣🤣🤣 He will summon himself to the chat again 😅

He is at full Allert .Dont know where they going with this. And gaurding he dnt sink one of his buddies. 
47:46,48:46, "he was not in the inner circle @wim louw Are we still going to @Roza essack farm for that braai and........ you go to school you get qualications then allow cadres to use you because of greed you loose everything from where is he lol he got a earpiece in Pastor u all welcome anytime but no goat plz yes Thando he's got the information but find it difficult to express it correctly Pastor JJ let the church pray for Ace . we need wisdom ❤️🙌🙌🙌

He is like an elephant. Remembers EVERYTHING! @Roza essack We will pretend it is a grade lamb nd here we can use all tge language we need nobody to hear us only cows nd goats 
49:33,50:17, And they wanted to finish with Baloyi before 1.00pm Baloyi might be visited by the Hawks tomorrow 🤷🙏🤣 😆 no pastor goat stinks @Cruda Bex I will try but he needs more than prayer now. Maybe a ticket to Cuba @Thobani. No one gets arrested. Only the fall guys. this is one of unreliable witness for this commission including zola tsotsi I don't know how one remains sane in an environments like these. Yet sadly it happens also in the so-called 'squicky clean' corporate sector as well. Trust me I experienced it!!! pastor 🤣🤣 
50:33,51:33, @Roza essack I thought goat was on the menuwith potato salad and malvapudding? they destroyed people lives thinking they were untouchable being used by corupt political deployed cadres why didnt Sodi run when hr heard about the investigations he made alot of money @Yolo More he speaks slowly (and i think it is frustrating for other people). He is very thorough and goes through matters with a very fine tooth comb rohan🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮 Do you think the ANC is talking about fighting corruption? No. They are talking about how to protect the ANC. It's not in the interest of the ANC for Ace to be arrested. its been 20 minutes on one minor point. @Tauseef Ahmed say hi to Atul Gupta roza.... i have the malva😁😁😁 
51:36,52:03, Really Mr Baloyi ag tauseef hi the comments are more interesting than commission Say that again Lwazi Nsele.

52:07,53:42, Zola Tsotsi yizo yizo!! agree roza 😂😂😂😂 no DCJ it happens a lot... check case law this guy is giving more then we can understand i always wanted a Bentley like Sodi @Tauseef any contact with the Guptas in Hyderbad @Zalisile Ndzala Remember Zuma removed any head of the law enforcement agencies with teeth to arrest and prosecute. But let's give Adv Batohi Adv Lamola a chance. They have a lot of backlog Alta oof thank u i was worried "@Pastor J.J She may be incarcerated by then Padre! I don't think she is as innocent as she appears. On top of that 
53:50,55:03, oh my word.... Gupta again .... and they fled he lied @Yolo More KWAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! Atul Gupta!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Tsotsi is remain Tsotsi 🤷😅😅 @Ayanda Ntsho now I understand @Thobani..Adv. Batohi was appointed by Ramaphosa. Adv. Lamola of the Youth League is not going to arrest Ace Magashula. Its reality. Gupta is another name of Zuma this is not a court of law but commission of inquiry no one will go to jail unless deliberately stole the money true cruda 
55:08,56:17, Pleasure @Yolo More @wim louw Remember I extended womans month for a further 12 months. After that we can send them to the tronk and give some company to all our recent new guests at Sun City You just need to be patient with Norman.

Adv Lamola has no allegiance to Mr. 10% but debatable. Did he say 4 billion? yes baba talk talk plzzzz Leakage R4 billion 
57:22,57:45, Spill the beans Mr Calm what a IT Tender of 4billion? where they buying Microsoft ? load of "...BUT bull Worst they allowed the chair of the board of another parastatal to medle in their affairs and took instructions from this individual as well. Insane!!! 
57:46,58:38, So Zola got the job after he had been recommended by the Guptas but he didn't know about that? i cant believe this 4 billion how possible is that? The ambassador was very negative😂😂😂 leakage of 4 billion Ambassador is a thug yay finally "@Thobani..I respect your patience. Politics is about power. Ace Magashula has considerable power. If he is arrested wow!!!!!!! thats a lot of money wasted 
58:42,59:23, I think there are ppl who were made to make wrong decisions by some politicians that's why it's difficult to answer some questions Eskom is useless clears throat like Zuma😊😊 "@Pastor J.J I hear you Padre Baloyi has a lot of valuable information but it needs sharp interrogation to extricate. Seleka is up to it but needs time. "Roza Excuse me. Going to go and throw up....... flat tyre "He turns off mike while a question is put to him

1:58:22,2:00:10, mr baloyi must blame no one than himself @Rip Torn lol I don't know why but I'm feeling sorry for Mr Baloyi. I'm looking at him and I just want to cry. Same happened with Maguvhe during SABC enquiry in parly Is Mr Baloyi aware of where he is @Vanessa Patterson yes.

Zuma was waiting in the wings to help them. @pheladi lamola i agree with you people like this must just forget about about directorship lol ye ye ye he keeps saying ummmm that is not allowed Khuluma Baloyi stop hiding things @Kopz Koape Thabo Mbeki gave SA the choice of a free market which would have been great for the economy. Although he has to answer for the many SA's that lost their lives with HIV/AIDS 
2:05:28,2:06:16, @Naledi yes..Also during Mbekis era as president SA was a more stable and happy nation.. Remember how simple life was back then @Reddy m with you 👩🏻 he seems doesn't know anything dis baloyi He’s really tired 🙆🏽‍♀️ baloyi was tainted with brown's disfavour and became persona non grata He's now suffering from total brain shut-down... lol...
