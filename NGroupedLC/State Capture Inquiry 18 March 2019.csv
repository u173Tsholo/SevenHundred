He is currently Deputy Director General of Department of Public Enterprise 
28:21,30:21, Lucky 123 Thwala who said that man is a thief. Listen to his testimony before jumping to conclusion I have checked and cannot see if he was subpoenaed Headline: President Ramaphosa to address ANC members in Pretoria Train station 5 minutes ago only about 150 people were attending him.

Shame Ramaphosa went for a train ride and got stuck because of load shedding @Madelein Huxtable Really? Where? Can we perhaps fast forward. This guy is going to take the entire morning to get through the introduction. 
31:01,34:15, Let's note that not everyone who appears at the commission is an accused. Some are called through to corroborate the information already received I am sure our Ex president is also implicated in this Denel issue. For sure "I must stop with my current masters degree @ @Anne M. from Mabopane to Bosman Ta You voted for them.........now you all complain ? "@Phillip Mphalo Correct

What more proof do you need that he's as guilty as all the other cadres who protected Zuma. @makhosi nobhatyi. So he employ ppl who are unqualified so he can tell them what to do and not to do. This is corruption Seems like this guy is telling the truth. "@Derek Main listen here carefully Ramaphosa has 5 years in government under Zuma "@ Masilela that how they control people Guys Dr. Makhosi Khoza is back in politics.
