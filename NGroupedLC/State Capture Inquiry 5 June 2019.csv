24:05,35:53, when is number one Tsotsi gonna come his dayz r numbered As Gordhan says those who are corrupt they are not just sitting there doing nothing they organize to fight back. He said that back 2016 we have seen this happening recently I am not surprised Nedbank is going down aswell. Power attracts the corruptible. Suspect any who seek it. I wonder when the human race will wake finally wake up.. I mean really wake up "You know To oppose corruption in government is the highest obligation of patriotism. Very well said @Ernest Eniboy 
36:44,49:45, True indeed Mr pieterse """To oppose corruption in government is the highest obligation of patriotism"" quote by G. Edward Griffin" @Ernest Eniboy ....eishhhh "Come forward as servants in this state capture organize the people economically Where is all the background singing coming from ? Listen to this guy @makhosi nobhatyi Yes - you only had to listen to Ace yesterday to see who is leading that charge. "Derek Main hey the old man is not reporting correctly "“Come forward as servants of Islam 
50:27,55:23, @makhosi nobhatyi He was clearly drunk and was doing his usual waffling. He didn't answer questions asked and eventually walked off without answering all questions. Total arrogance. Ace was just blabbing (the whole party has no idea where to start with the land issue ).How can we trust them? @Naledzani Mashau don't trust any politician.. @makhosi nobhatyi He actually asked for the scraping of the tender system. I'm not sure why he would want that - Mr Ten Percent has made a lot of money from tenders. "Reserve bank issue statement to the minister of finance which he rubbishy all of that Yep - NEVER trust a politician. You can trust them at your own peril yup .. just make sure you are in a space where you can deal with disappointments @ Derek Main the most dangerous people in the world are politicians 
55:58,1:00:21, "@Naledzani Mashau the party knows where to start but problem is "just here to listen to Derek @Ernest Eniboy Tell me about it - politicians are more trouble than they are worth (and expensive). We should get rid of them. "Ramaphosa patience will come to unend coz when they continue doing so they are delaying government to do its own job so that they can count on him as a failure Black people are not corrupt but corrubtable @Zikhona Zondani I'm flattered. The cheque is in the mail. @Cassius Mngomezulu I don't understand the difference - please explain. R50- per lesson n nothing 4 mahala True indeed @ Derek main 
1:00:23,1:04:29, @makhosi nobhatyi We citizens should be unseating Ramaphosa if he doesn't deliver on his promises. I hope these commissions r not a waste of time we want to see heads rolling I think Ace Magashule was not supposed to report about SARB matter because it not yet been finalized when is npa stepping in "@Cassius Mngomezulu ""Black people are not corrupt"" PULEEZ" @makhosi nobhatyi So you think that Ace talking about SARB was the worst thing about his performance last night? "Government's first duty is to protect the people @Derek main I got you brother but faction of are in the hurry as you heard Masina and Tony Yengeni publicly criticize president for appointing Gordhan they feel threatened Official are Easy to Corrupt e.g you are a traffic officer you earn R27 000 a month your in charge of contractors management & your facilitating R20million tender easy u get R200 000 you ofer Contract 
1:04:55,1:16:02, never trust a Human being The corrupted have their hands out all the time waiting for golden crumbs off the main table Ace is worst that any other SG ever elected . what happened at Nasrec mara!? "@Derek main no I am not suggesting that he was a worst thing all I am trying to say he is lacking experience he should report outcomes @Singi Mathebula so true "I dont understand how the anc chooses its people I don't know how people vote for the ANC. Corrupt to the core. Welcome to the party of Mandela "@Zikhona Zondani ANC chief whip she is a hard work 
1:22:17,1:42:18, "Ernest @zikhona zondani usually whoever is willing to be a puppet or sell their soul to the hugest bidder to do their dirty deeds for the puppeteer gets the position ❤️ but that’s just my opinion ...but why is it that every other white folk coming to testify at the commision has to be interrogated by adv.Pritorious??..Why is it that way??? @Erastus Adolf Huh??? "wrong Exactly Mbongeni! Another race baiter in the house? is Rajesh white? Adolf blocked The wittness' expertise is matched by the evidence leader. 
1:43:17,1:47:45, “Sexy girl” are so annoying @Tee Makara Jip....bunch of rubbish!! @SABC Digital News MODERATOR Please do your job "@Tee Makara  Maybe moderators were sold to ANN7 too😏 @Tee Makara 😀 "@Tee Makara  thanks for removing this annoying thing 👍 @Frik Brits they annoying period 
1:48:50,1:53:27, Proteas 2 for 24 runs! Here we go again?? @Cerebis s - Oh no! The chokers reputation continues "Enoch Godwangana is not happy at all by the matter of SARB saying wat was read by SG was not accepted resolution of naserec says SARB should be remain private @Tebogo Lenyora Who are they playing? @Anne M. Yes....So sad....and frustrating!! Cerebis dont be mean they are an excellent side "@makhosi nobhatyi Yes @Tebogo Lenyora Doesn't Afcon have pool stages? @Peter Staffen You are right! I think that the Proteas is a weak team 
1:54:06,2:02:16, proteas are playing India Didn't Zwane also make a statement re engaging the banks on the Gupta accounts and claim it was a Cabinet Resolution? @Cerebis Ace Magashule is reading post naserec NDZ campaign not resolution of the conference. Conference was very clear about reserve bank that remained private so we can create jobs hello We don't know who in the ANC to listen to anymore. Contradictory messages. "@Derek main 🙆🏻‍♀️😃😃😀 no you need to understand old man is fighting back using Anc position to sabotage Ramaphosa leadership doing purposely leaving this soap opera .. Days of our lives Ramaphosa stance in fighting corruption hasn’t changed @makhosi nobhatyi 100% correct! ANC must start speaking in one voice! CR must introduce a system of only nominated person allowed to make public comments? 
2:03:24,2:09:42, Transnet should have adopted the same approach in March if they learnt anything of the Desember swop. @makhosi nobhatyi But Ace is who the ANC members elected! Why do you expect any different? It's almost the same as ANC voters believing that the thieves in government will tackle corruption. "Yet they repeated the same ""mistake"". Fishy" @Cerebis 🙆🏻‍♀️😀😀😀 CR have huge problem here Ace Magashule is messing everything when Q&A happens lol faction live inside him lol hai @Tebogo Lenyora Mayor of JHB is a DA member "@ Derek main yes those people should listen to Mbalula back in 2015 when he says electing Ace the party will go down "Perhaps Ace knows his number is up and trying to sow misinformation as much as he can This black guy has no idea what he’s talking about 
2:11:25,2:21:40, @kevin Allister Simon indeed it is number coming weeks Guptas whistle blowers will take stand and email will be show as reflection so he is trying to get supporters but he is weak no power "I hope before he can address media "@Tebogo Lenyora Fine I agree The man cant deal with media "ANC is for all people We just need honest ppl in government and this country will flourish "Come on ANC you think we are going to see job losses from government that's a measly affect the main reason we are going to see huge job losses is people are leaving markets are clenching cell c are losing client like everyone else 
2:22:01,2:25:45, gupta family from india by covert support from gov india behind State capture South Africa "@kevindbn007 Yes we got some hard times ahead skilled workers are leaving "So we are hearing testimony from all these ppl "Ace should be premier of free state "as i understand it "@Kapn Krunch It is very true! In my immediate family and friends circle "@Kevindbn007 it is a process that will happen need time as we go along myself my parents my brother and one side of my grandparents are the only ones still here of a family of about 30 so yeah I'm the same 
2:26:05,2:28:33, But all these weeks and nothing has come of it @Zikhona Zondani Maybe he should be in jail? He was a disaster in the Free State....period! @Zikhona Zondani you notice what I have seen 😃😃😃 carteblanche did an episode on the numbers that are leaving at the moment "that ANN7 guy revealed some damning testominy about ""certain"" high profile ANC people" SABC digital news please show the slides!!!! doesn't bode well for the future of our country "JZ being involved in the running of the station is worrying for every one skilled worker we lose 3 families have less money for food as we are a welfare state 
2:29:25,2:34:03, @Kevindbn007 that is what we need those who did wrong must be exposed and acount here and be arrested that was a resolution we took at Naserec That is a huge problem as the people leaving are crucial to job creation. Government does not create jobs in spite of the political rhetoric yes our skilled workers are also our consumers less consumers mean companies down size which results in less jobs @makhosi nobhatyi My point is that we can't depend on the ANC voters to vote for the betterment of SA. They don't think that far ahead. Agree! Just look at the latest numbers from the JSE companies.....mostly down This derek fella is obsessed with the anc Trump is a chump. everything he says has the anc embedded in it @Zikhona Zondani Only because their decisions and criminality affect me. I wouldn't mind if they died altogether so I wouldn't have to worry about their negative effect on SA. 
2:34:20,2:44:40, "Latest GDP numbers is a disaster! And the Unions "people are not risk takers If anc deploys me as a minister I should do my job honestly and transparency no shenanigans once I have found I did wrong party mustn’t defend me fire me to save image of the organization I just want to take ace's position 😂😂😂😂 the ancs rhetoric in parliament their blatant lies their blame shifting their announcements of radical policies without the plan on how they are going to enact those policies have led directly to this @Zikhona Zondani Then we can expect more of the same for the next 100 years. Criminality and plunder. their moves to stay in power first gave investors cold feet now its given our very people could feet "I block so many of these rubbish adds cant the adds be stopped.
