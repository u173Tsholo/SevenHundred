We are led by fools "What act Zwane applied LOL MUTI TIME FOR ZWANE "mfoka Jobe he's now tired now

4:22:28,4:23:46, @Philip Cwazibe Exactly! Now he's crying foul as if the commission is thumb-sucking the very piece he quoted repeatedly in the morning mooneeseepality "@Phillip He said the hod told him abt part of the act allowing database and he agreed to that He does not know any of those Acts. @ watson mutanga He is theone. we have been appointed...yaaa around june ..july this man mara None of them do of course he knows the acts . . . but he cannot admit it now can he? Thanks Phillip. 
4:23:47,4:25:05, but Zondo is not a fool! That's what happens when you're appointed based on connection rather than qualification @Christopher Peters Where are they ? How can give somebody such a high portfolio who has no clue what’s happening HOW WAS HE DEPLOYED TO THE POST IF HE DIDNT KNOW THE ACT VELE "@Phillip and @Watson is very important to listen with willingness to understand imisebenzi yakho zwane izo kugubela straight The screws are being tighthen that is why Zuma do not want to be exposed like this for all his doings.... great point mr chairman 
4:25:08,4:26:21, impela akukho qili lazikhotha emhlane HAO CHAIR THIS GUY MUST TO THIS NONSENSE The guy is bringing shame on us with a lie. How can one be appointed in a position and sit not knowing anything? It means his only mandate was looting and Ace was more important than any legislation. The investigators can prove if he knew about the Housing Act before April 2010. They only need to go through govt bulletins during that period. @Eric Sithole he had all this time to 'atlamathaiz' himself with it all now he is just waffling All ministers should know the acts regarding their portfolio's.WTF are CR thinking with ghoons like this in his cabinet.We are where we are with puppet communists that only loot for their own pockets The man is loosing his voice... "DCJ 
4:26:23,4:27:35, You right Peter How did you pass Matric Zwane when you don't read important documents pertinent to your portfolio Zondo is very soft to this criminal. I don't think that Bushiri wristband is saving him right now... I wonder how he left this municipality he keeps referring to. "mzomuhle I said this in the morning Was this man ever in a real school or did he attend the anc looting school here you don't need any education. How much does this Zwane know about the PFMA? Die man lieg 
4:27:37,4:28:45, "@Mondli Nohashe  "This is why officials win all labour disputes WOW there are so many young black qualified people that would have served better then Zwane what a useless character......as they say black child you're in your own . this man studied corruption not the PFMA @Christopher Joseph Moodley exactly Craig Johnson Simply LAZY combined with a sense of entitlement and sprinkled with arrogance. his voice is like a cry baby because of all the lying. But the legislation is fundamental Mr Zwane 🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥 
4:28:54,4:29:48, This is the same person who threatened somebodies livlihood. this guys cannot be in charge anymore @Michael Holmes 🤣🤣🤣💦 Gosh How stupid do the ANC voters feel like now Zwane was placed in this position right after JZ was elected as president. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 lie under oat number 467 he is lying to get away "voters don't watch these things 
4:30:09,4:31:24, @Michael Holmes That's my conclusion as well. He read into the PFMA not the PFMA 🤣 @ANCHOR and free food parcels or a R10 "You didn't know what you were doing Zwane Salary for what? not knowing your job.....weak This is not a political gathering of some sort Mr Zwane. Please account grootman. "this guy earns more than 1 @Craig Johnson. Is 467 his prison number ? "exactly """The chair has been very polite in this regard""" 
4:31:29,4:32:20, This Zwane ghoon was a MEC...did he even know what that means?? @Mondli Nohashe hope so "never allow any form of intimidation Zwane @Anchor: that’s the painful truth you just said. Voters expect very little due to their diminished senses of self regard. "lol "WEAK ZWANE if jacob zuma can open his university no one can fail you can see for yourself ....phd of lies from zwane where did he obtain it ......from ace or zuma that's the question :elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: Morning all 
4:32:24,4:33:56, Lol he's not being intimidated... he is just being asked questions... passing the buck @Siyabonga Kubheka. Zondo is soft to this criminal Special Kind of Stupid. Studied at teh Zuma school of ethics and Economics Safa i PFMA and I'm pretty sure there are people who still wear ANC T shirts and tell you they will vote for them He is now exposed and embarrassed @Eric Sithole Do you support his lies?..... he said earlier he found the process there and then said he implemented it. eric sithole it shows that you support zwane's wrong doing. why.... 
4:34:01,4:34:35, geaduating from mfpa u see he knows a lot about PFMA 🤣🤣🤣🤣 lol graduation to provincial corruption word salad "mr pretoriusvis very skillful he thought that the truth will not come out  Zwane could open a bakery with all these waffles... hay suxoka Mr Mzwane. you didn't follow PFMA at all Zwane was obsessed with the PFMA instead of the most relevant legislation to human settlements which is the Housing Act. this guy must go back to school This stooge is boring now 
4:34:37,4:35:24, "@Eric Sithole """all I'm saying is what is your agenda. its very suspect. """You didn't read the Act""" lol You did not read the ACT 🙂 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 like I said earlier- I'm a PAC member but Zwane stand your ground broer🥃 didn't know the housing Act existed???? 
4:35:33,4:36:07, The act drives behavior. Because he didnt read the act he didnt behave well. U get sworn in This is embarrassing. 😏 tools to steal HE DID NOT KNOW IT EXISTED 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 """You did not know that the housing Act existed?"" ""That is correct""" "HUMANS Hahahahahaha Sis on you Zwane

4:36:46,4:36:59, Didn't even know of the act... Lord have mercy... but he confess that they give him file with everything on the induction You see when you say a Circus ...this is playing in front of us How could an MEC not know the Act guiding his portfolio? Why did he not read the Act? Surely he knows about Acts? I think he’s not being honest. "He was not there to implement the housing act FAAARK...he should wash trollies at checkers..but will be fired after 10 minutes because of looting But you don't know the act how was he operating without knowing his duties and responsibilities curu ya pfma...how is it that monies were spent njenje? 
4:37:10,4:37:28, Surely CR can chase him out of parliament now. He is pocking holes in his own testimony like their beloved Ramaphosa who lied in parliament and promised to get his son arrested if any wrong doing was found and later changed by saying I was wrongly advised. Zwane is also allow to say so He knows the PFMA act. but the Guptas stole 300 million from the Estina Dairy farm project so if we dont read the law we are innocent? lol lets just go back to the facts!!! "truly  "These fools can't read or write cause they sing slogans 
4:37:32,4:37:51, he is being exposed now that's why JZ run away yet he knew the work of the hod Not knowing the law is not an excuse in a court of law Ignorance of the law is not an excuse. A full minister does not know there is a Housing Act. You are taking us for fools. this guy should be taken to jail after this session "Pls Zwane cut it short bro Oh my... it really makes you wonder about the other ministers... induction were done with him how can he not know about the act lol A year as MEC not know that a housing act existed...FAAAARK 
4:37:53,4:38:26, Why did you not ask if you did not understand Dam 😢😢😢 When will these people be brought before a court of law? arest this guy now!!! "I wonder what his boss will say Ace BS "you would also had a benefits of experts who would give you advise MEC give him another chance!!!!!! 
4:38:27,4:38:53, Acting ignorant Lazy minds...dont want to read...he ignored the act Arrest this arshole now!!! Then go fetch Ace !! @ a b c you can imagine! So even the legal officials were clueless?? these people musty take regulation exams who's results that must be publicly published this is rubbish 🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉 He is a moral delinquent and a thief. This one and some of the other crooks were appointed but Ace. I am sure that Ramaphosa is powerless to stop Ace in the hole. "Niyalayeka balandeli bakakhongolose 
4:38:56,4:39:25, @Alan I'll get the truck ready l am tired of his lies already I think we need to introduce CPD to these politicians. Mandatory CPD. I can't wait for the day we hear Ace in the commission he is playing a victim he had a legal team he never used it Mr. Pretorius is now livid!!!! a year as a MEC without know your department acts? yoh its hectic @jwarha21 eish mthathe Pitoli 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️😂
