2:29:37,2:30:08, Theres a whole power dynamic at play too re Boss and employee and maybe he didnt think everybody around him was a crook.

He is trying to make sense they just arrest Ace now he will eat his lunch at prison @zip reeper 😄😄 Forty winks! DCJ are you there? Zondo is already having lunch @Umar Singh Today DCJ is not asking any questions as this witness is like an Expert Witness zondo went to the plaza for lunch... @Louis C ....oh yes.....an even a couple of devil chillies in da sambles etc.........heheh

He is just using ears today 
2:32:17,2:32:48, Bull dust baffles brains The point of this witness was to keep the DCJ confused 😕 "Aslm cassim @jenny..100% @Jenny Whitewaves I totally agree with you It speaks ! he forgot to ay every new spreadsheet a higher price for clan pockets zondo is waiting for amla to hit another six "This is what happens when as a kid your parents tell you: ""You will be an accountant one day whether you like it or not boy!"""
