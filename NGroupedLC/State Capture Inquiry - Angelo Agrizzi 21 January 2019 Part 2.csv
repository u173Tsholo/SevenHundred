"oh ok  @Clayton Chukwu cant fail when pass mark is being dropped continuously EFF can't debate with Fools like BLF ! BLF speaks non-sensical things .how can you debate with a crazy man

He wanted to fight back and defend himself not that he cares about the enquiry EFF it's really animal farm with the hatred of white people in our country Lol ....VBS ......EFF

"had Julius & Zuma not had a fall out ppl singing praise for JM would not be do so. he helped JZ & Guptas to put us in this hole.

1:26:38,1:30:39, I wonder if that Aston Martin belonged to James this angelo in the UK would be regarded as a supergrass "Who remembers cash heists of USD from airplanes at OR Tambo International? If you do watch Fridays evidence supergrass this angelo certainty is thando supergrass more accurate why did BOSASA want remotes for the cargo gates at ORTIA? They didnt do security at cargo area. Does anyone else wonder about the massive amounts of cash that went missing at ORTIA? Kevin where do you work? I am a journalist For who? 
1:31:07,1:33:44, for myself and I would not disclose details on this thread @thando üò£ üòÇü§£üòÇ Imvula Guys I missed the start of the 2nd part (after lunch) who received groceries from who? thando Southampton these people joking about rare beef... while people starve ... while these fat cats eat well from our taxes. thando I wish I am just a poor journalist not the player "Nomvula Mokonyane was apparently getting 120 crates of cool drink
