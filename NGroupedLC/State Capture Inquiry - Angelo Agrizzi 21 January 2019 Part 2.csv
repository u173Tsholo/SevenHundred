"oh ok  @Clayton Chukwu cant fail when pass mark is being dropped continuously EFF can't debate with Fools like BLF ! BLF speaks non-sensical things .how can you debate with a crazy man

50:29,55:19, "I remember what Fylod Shivambu said to #ThumaMina that if you think Mngxitama is logik ! than you must be crazy yourself! the blind leading the blind "Ever since PreZuma resigned @Ntshibongo Tobela where are these parties...i am way too hungry to hate @Tobela I take it that you did not see him at the state capture inquiry when PG went there... doing what @snqobile @phumzile qwaba. true all politicians have the same goal to chop de mani @Snqobile Khuzwayo you was rite my broda "Oh really Julius attends parties 
55:37,57:03, We as EFF also looking 4wd to make our party get success without any corruption sounds like animal farm is it wrong for cic to attend parties? In an environmentally friendly way? EFF never talks environment and mining affected communities no...just invite us its not like its campaigning Julius only went to the State capture enquiry because there was a VBS Saga which implicated him. He wanted to fight back and defend himself not that he cares about the enquiry EFF it's really animal farm with the hatred of white people in our country Lol ....VBS ......EFF 
57:24,1:01:06, Vincent Smith will be jailed for this. The evidence is clear and overwhelming yep hopefully sata'frika...whos leaving?

"had Julius & Zuma not had a fall out ppl singing praise for JM would not be do so. he helped JZ & Guptas to put us in this hole. JM wuld still be enjoying the packs Zuma and his previous cabinet must be tried in a court of law 
1:09:02,1:12:17, angelo running the butchery lol no wonder the prisons give there inmates vegetables meat is corrupt "Corruption did not start at Zuma's tenure  so much meat on the news...cabbage😭 it is for me Yip. It started with the ANC regime after NM true Magugu. the ANC has long been corrupt. As a black person ive lost all hope I hope you white people are happy and proud thats why im voting cope mikey schultz misses a trick could have given this angelo.a black eye

He is looking for leniency when the corruption charges are pursued because they are coming for him. @Clayton Chukwu i am right there behind you...ahuh 
1:15:39,1:17:18, and bring the beautiful smart lady back Bongumenzi this Agrizzi guy said that the way they cooked the whole saga was in such a manner that even auditors i presume he meant forensics missed it so u can imagine Tseleng Phala lols @Thando Nkutha maskopas tender in brakpan thando we have to all go vegetarian like Paul McCartney 🤨 these people..... @Kevin Davis its Jan...the cabbage awaits Where was this beef going to?

1:26:38,1:30:39, I wonder if that Aston Martin belonged to James this angelo in the UK would be regarded as a supergrass "Who remembers cash heists of USD from airplanes at OR Tambo International? If you do watch Fridays evidence supergrass this angelo certainty is thando supergrass more accurate why did BOSASA want remotes for the cargo gates at ORTIA? They didnt do security at cargo area. Does anyone else wonder about the massive amounts of cash that went missing at ORTIA? Kevin where do you work? I am a journalist For who?
