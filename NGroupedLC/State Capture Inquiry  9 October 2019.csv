13:17,18:16, The reason for late start was the lawyers were meeting in chambers with Zondo. "@Concerned South African Since the law is no longer serving us I can't seem to get the audio. Who wants to miss Angelo Agrizi. What if he mentions my name. I need to hear him. "@Derek Main​ yebo @Paul Buchel That's what I'm talking about - we're on our own and need to deal with our own issues. Our government is unable or simply doesn't care to administer justice fairly or competently. @Paul Buchel Criminals are running amok in the vacuum. Where is AG?
