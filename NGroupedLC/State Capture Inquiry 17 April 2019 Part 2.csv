time,7:22,message I’m just here for the comments. PART 2 Im ready.... @Alexander Dowding as long as the comments are related to the discussions at the commission.. I don’t have any problems with that @Felix Muyoba @Felix Muyoba 😆 I’ve got to water my weed plants. Be right back @funicanz and @Alexander Dowding in most cases i beg your pardon.. Commissioner Ngobeni appears to have been fully captured.She allowed Panday to act like the Guptas 
7:33,14:18, Very interesting @Thando Nkutha. We heard about husbands parties paid by service providers and over charges. "@Felix Muyoba  Commissioner Ngobeni appears to have been in a similar position as Nomgcobo Jiba. Things happening under her guidance and she'll appear to not being aware of the shenanigans. The commission is far from completed Robert who knows what skeletons will still be exposed.PS:Add Ace to your list Ace has his own personal 'state capture' in the FS Ace is part of the ANC looting cabal... @Magda Seguin Yes but he and Mabuza had their own parallel situations apart from the mother organisation and you forgot Supra!!!! There are so many...yes off course Supra is another situation 
14:31,18:31, The large rhino horn find in NW has some smell of Supra No doubt @Michael Wild "South Africa needs cleansing This trauma will haunt us for generations Throw a net over the top 6 of the ANC and we have sorted out 80% of our corruption problems. we need death penalty back first then some healing and law and order restored. "Parliament needs a whole generation of born free MPs to take the places of all these corrupt ... these political dinosaurs go. Young like he EFF? from the frying pan into the fire?No thanks 
18:53,26:17, @Michael Wild death penalty won't work with our current justice system. Innocent people will be killed by the hundreds Death penalty has been proven to be NOT a deterrent to crime "I do agree We really only need a Mutiparty Gov with each party having the same number of reps......or something like like........NO Majority party etc etc...... @Robert Russell Common denominator in all the corruption is the ANC. The Sunday Times articles about Gen.Booysen was complete with fake photos CR today again blamed kids being taught under trees on apartheid...I completely lost respect for him The New Zealand parliament is made up of 88% of people aged between 30 and 59..... and a FEMALE Prime Minister aged 38..... Rama is cut from the same ANC Cloth.........for sure. 
26:40,28:30, Who is this Jacob Zuma writing here? Agreed @rohan barnard "A troll @Anne M. agree Anne M I thought so @Anne how do u know looool Zuma cant use Technology His name hasn't been brought up by Booysen Heheheh....maybe trying to capture STI........heheheh 
28:35,31:36, Panday is a busy of Zuma *buddy Everyone in the private sector who is a crook is a friend of Zuma or one of his kids... Edward Zuma is Panday's friend too And in business together @Magda Seguin I never specified EFF when I said youth. There are plenty other other honorable and well educated black and other race youth who will make brilliant energetic and inspiring MPs. eish... the general took arithmetic lessons from Zuma LO< "Yes @Robert Russell he should have said it in afrikaans 
32:07,33:54, The brains of the present lot of aged MPs all suffer from a condition called Apartheid Hangover Syndrome. They cannot see the wood for the trees anymore. They must GO. and Zuma should say numbers in morse code hehehehe... JZ can even tweet We won’t make any real progress until they go. how much did you steel Jacob? "numbers I can hear the sound of DCJ breathing I hear you Alexander Dowding but first the ANC followers have to be exercised from the ingrained 'struggle' attachment i swa he is quite active on his tweetergram 
33:58,35:16, @Lucky123 Thwala same *exorcised @welton paulse Probably one of his young wives or children are helping him with it. "Thanks Why is Zondo on her case? Please follow old man You bringing the church into it again Magda.... 😃 Jacob Zuma Nxamala You are here?? It’s much easier to get a person elected into parliament as an MP than it is to get them out! 
35:18,37:57, she is learning I think Zuma' s wife Thobeka is handling his Twitter account...she has the same style of writing on Instagram "Jacob Zuma How much do you have left in your account @Anne M. he is planning to come back as Minister of finance @welton paulse 😂😂😂😉 "@welton paulse  😆😆 @funicanz yes indeed 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 
38:07,40:09, welton paulse This one is a fake Zuma please do not offend us Zuma! he can't read out the numbers. so he can't tell you how much he stole bathong this man ntate zuma what is he talking about... how about being matured tlheee Zuma here?

They can take the land. They will sell it again. 300 years from now they will say its stolen again. History will repeat itself ANC is Rotten Jacob Zuma is rotten Ace is rotten Provide proof that it was bought "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux we already owns the economy of SA 
1:11:23,1:14:27, Lots of land has already been sold to the Arabs and Chinese...even the Waterfront in CT "But if black ppl were forcebly removed and have a legitimate claim Jean we’d love to have a claim but it will be considered reverse racism if that is done and according to the law we are not allowed to do that because we don’t have proof of who owned the land before "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux NONE of the black leaders will give the the black people transport deeds for the land  What is reverse racism? As far as I know racism IS racism...nothing else "@Cameron Kim  Not a valid answer Booysens was an apartheid cop ! let's leave it there ? We know what was his role as a resident of Midlands KZN . thousands were killed . 
1:14:52,1:16:03, There is no such thing as reverse racism there is reverse apartheid @Magda Seguin ....exactly true.... Then what is racism Magda? Also google reverse racism if my definition does not do you justice Very funny "No fight back now black ppl are also racist "@Felix Muyoba  Black are also racist I agree Jean 
1:16:31,1:17:44, @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN ......and so it will go on for ever and ever............it a'int ever gonna stop.......or will it... Robert words are invented to suit circumstances "@Thando Nkutha  "Thando you are not the entire black nation @Thando Nkutha I'm white and I'm also not a racist. Bell Pottenger springs to mind Magda Ask any English major about reverse racism they will cringe @Thando Nkutha Seems like e have a lot of race-baiters here today. "@Jean-Pierre Le Roux NO  
1:17:46,1:20:02, @Jean-Pierre Le Roux ...spot on "Sometimes I walk around my garden naked @Robert Russell Bell Potterger made a lot of money out of the balcks Yes Robert...White Monopoly Capital was made up for the Gupta/ANC agenda and they were paid royally for it Yes the word selfie would also make English majors cringe but it’s a word none the less @Jean...heheheh...you wanted to show off to Jacob......heheh Yes because blacks wanted to create a narrative that suited their own agenda... @Cameron Kim Nah - that's it - I'm starting to block whoever I think is a race-baiter. @Jean-Pierre Le Roux YOU LIVE IN A FOOLS PARADISE WE OWN EVERYTHING YOU PEOPLE BUY 
1:20:13,1:21:41, I'm calling it a day. I will chat tomorrow. Signing out!! ☮ "@Cameron Kim  Well we learned from white people to adjust narratives Is CR following these proceedings? I want to believe that he is waiting for this testimony before he can make a decision on Jiba and Mrwebi. @funicanz you said nothing I should stop being a teacher/lecturer "@Derek Main  @Thando Nkutha I'm happy to listen to differing views but naked racism is something I steer clear of. If the EFF wins it is just more profit for Asia lol you guys are sleeping 
1:21:58,1:24:04, @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN ........Geees Sista......you sound a bit cheesed off.....ne Like that "imagine CIA Eeeesh...the race card always get played.....ne @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN we already took it over They do...in front of Congress @MIKE LOCK that is the only way some people can respond when they run out of knowledge like the ANC and EFF chappies "@MIKE LOCK our government traditionally didn’t work like this @Coder2100 the Mueller docs are being opened for the public today too 
1:24:29,1:26:17, @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN your government runs SA as a tribal homeland Traditionally means chiefs in charge? @Magda Seguin I admire you. You have a lot of knowledge. @rohan barnard indeed yes Thank you @rohan barnard I am humbled "@Magda yes I don't see why we use race to address governance. It's been done since SA was put on the world map. Governance and understanding why you're in power are what guides the country's prosperity or demise "@Magda Seguin yes "@MIKE LOCK forget it  
1:26:23,1:30:00, "@Mike Lock we were supposed to come together at the supposed end of apartheid and we didn’t @Jean-Pierre Le Roux I'm interested in your encounter with the police last night 😂😂 What happened next?🙈 @rohan barnard ....yes her depth of knowledge is very impressive... but imagine being married to her @Magda Seguin .... you would never win a argument... 😃 😃 😃 "@MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN without WHITE PEOPLE the black political parties are dead You are making me blush Interesting to see how many people from 3 rd world countries come here to Voronez ( Russia) to buy military equipment - with people starving in its coutries my grandfather never approve of chiefs or kings because of the authoritarian behaviour @Robert Russell if one is married to @Magda Seguin it's a blessing! She will definitely keep you on the straight and narrow "@Matthew Adams free land  
1:30:38,1:32:31, @Cameron Kim ethically those people selling arms should refuse to sell them to 3rd world countries then.. "I’m not saying the world was perfect "The group of people on this forum are amazing human beings @Cameron Kim they also hide the tax payers money there while the people their countries fight for scraps I feel like hitting Zondo hard on the chest.....that potatoe will jump out of his throat @Felix Muyoba nobody forced the leader to come and buy arms @Felix Muyoba even your country is here lol Very sad been robbed of the future of next generation. "keeping me on the ""straight"" an narrow would be impossible as I'm part of the LGBT community @rohan barnard" 
1:32:37,1:34:09, @Felix Muyoba you vote for the clowns spending the money @Cameron Kim yes nobody forced the leader to buy the arms but if it ethically incorrect because of the world peace narrative everyone is spinning then the arms dealers should refuse to sell @Cameron Kim if you accept the money then you are also corrupt @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN you live in a dream world @Robert Russell you can ask my LBGTQ friends...I'm not an ogre 😊 exactly @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN @Felix Muyoba NO - I do LEGAL business according to international law Please explain to @Matthew Adams why we block some people @Cameron Kim no man..thats not legal 
1:34:12,1:36:12, @Cameron Kim so do you if you do not want to acknowledge that voters are blind sided and don’t know what happens with some of their tax money @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN exactly..politicians use all sorts of things to hide their intentions @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN Arms dealers and ethical don't fit in the same sentence together. @Felix Muyoba It is the people your county voted for in a democratic election. You shoul rather adress this with the leaders you voted for Melinda I will not call it 'blindsided' but rather 'abused' @Cameron Kim yes but you also should not sell arms to the leaders "@Cameron Kim we would address these matters if we knew they were occurring @Cameron Kim It might be legal but it's not ethical. @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN It is not my responsibility to decide who can vote 
1:36:35,1:38:11, @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN the last cancelled deal WAS in the media What do votes have to do with anything? This sounds like a movie @Derek Main so what is your point Cancelled deal not occurring and one out of how many? I am listening nothing escapes me @Matthew Adams but if you say I must shut up I will not so why did they get into the car It was in the papers even in SA so there was general discussion 
1:38:19,1:42:06, @MELINDA CHANTELLE MARTYN It was in the papers even in SA He must have wanted proof of the bribe its not the people that that voted in 1994 but the one that didn't even in 8 May people will not vote @Thando Nkutha THRILLER if anyone doubts this man then they involved in this actions Indisputable evidence everything in the ANC SOUTH AFRICA TURNED INTO GARBAGE yeah magda... but what will happen with that evidence under a ANC government @Matthew Adams I think they may monitor us things being as they are...they are aware of our disdain 
1:42:20,1:44:40, Funny language is the comrade accent right.. "17 million South Africans receive grants from SASA Robert I know the trust is gone @Alirio De Araujo JUST THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE MONEY DRIES UP "I am so angry about where we have found ourselves due to the leadership of the ANC @Alirio De Araujo 17 MILLION GRANS IS 4 X MORE THAN THE TOTAL WHITE COMMUNITY "ANC run by murderers @Robert Russell me too! 😂 We are becoming a nanny state with 17 million grantees and only 8 million formal taxpayers.I know everyone pays VAT and levies but it is not nearly enough 
1:45:06,1:46:18, @Matthew Adams I block racists and bots "in the state address "Will never dry up "SAA I don't need that kind of negativity in my life Chair is Chairing now ESCOM WHAT AN ANC SUCCESS I'm signing out. Everyone have a great day! Will chat again tomorrow. 😃 "And those ANC leaders have no shame @Robert Russel. They're going door to door as if nothing happened 
1:46:27,1:48:03, @Cameron Kim Stop shouting dude. "Foreigner investment is very thin on the ground @Matthew Adams difficult to give real figures in a 3 rd world country for the health and safety of South Africa. the ANC cannot gorn anymore. all these gangsta type Mafia moves are created by the ANC. the NP did the same in the apartheid days. game over for the ANC. @Derek Main Is the SAA ect a success? "Can someone fill me in @Cameron Kim You want me to defend them? Two bar!! One learns something new every day ne 
1:48:15,1:49:59, two bob SA MUST GET MUGABE TO COME AND THE COUNTRY shocking revelations "I just got in @Cameron Kim You're coming across as hysterical. "There we go @Tornado Muganji WHY IS THIS SHOCKING @Derek Main and you as stupid and uninformed or delusional @Cameron Kim Please explain.

His like Gavin Watson.. Just imagine how effective our Police Service will be if most of them were dedicated and efficient like this guy? I said many months ago that gavin Watson will walk free ..... but Gavin was doing ANCWL work where this guy was on his own. @Desmond Masilela ​I said many months ago that gavin Watson will walk free ..... 
2:09:36,2:11:04, @Cameron Kim. His even free now as we talk. Gavin Watson owns the ANC - they will keep protecting him @Wallace Mandimutsira only non essential people will go to eat Bosasa food Goosen he is a ANC member The DCJ misses nothing. "You don’t see ZIM in petrol stations I hope the guy did not accept 10000 rand for petrol like the Guptas @Desmond Masilela yes and contracts are still running . Watson is higher up in the ANC @Pheladi Lamola he is focused 
2:11:16,2:12:58, @Pheladi Lamola He took very strong medicine during the lunch break @Desmond Masilela if he gets 10 000 bucks for fuel 5000 of that goes back to the government as tax and more bribes @Cameron Kim. We not going anywhere with this commission. They should have closed all these contracts of Bosasa Zondo must be paid the president salary Zuma is in every curry pot. @Norman Zwane he must have taken a non-sedative cough remedy. His mind is sharp. I like it So not only Zuma's son's but nephews as well @Cameron Kim. Remember that guy who refused 2milion and accepted 10000 rand from the Guptas. the guy with grey hair. "@Desmond Masilela 100 % correct Desmond. REMEMBER if there is a commission then the government wash all allegations eazy
