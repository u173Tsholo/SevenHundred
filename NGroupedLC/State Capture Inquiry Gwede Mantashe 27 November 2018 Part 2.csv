9:35,12:11, Terence tito no title deeds? so why give land lol Keep him calm @unathi I am asking a question not making a statement. if u not literate in the English language then refrain from making judgements we are 90% they are less than 10% of the country... we were doing fine before them "I don't know farming #1 stance BANKS Guptas aren’t even South Africans! Such support from the ANC! @Terence Tito u have been fed this poison that the land is all about agriculture and u swallowed it. 
13:28,17:02, "bullshit dude... I know it's about land Singi Mathebula you are dreaming my friend. @bushula my question is based on people wanting land but can they financially sustain the land they want OB MEETINGS land is wealth and prestige and whites have a history of farming on our land and have empowered themselves to the marginalize us into poverty @Terence Tito it seems I have touched the nerve judging by your explosion with such a slight provocation. i cant here mantashe guys "@dave I agree 100% Adv Maleka were suppose to conduct this 
17:06,18:46, "@bushula u touched a nerve by judgements can someone interprete for me.... what is Gwede saying This is a secretary who knows what he was doing not what Manyi did ​Discussion of first meeting said...Two points "@singi Mathebula Guys...it's all about the MONEY........ANC helping Guptas for all the kickbacks.......cone on guys.....it's plain to see...... "Mike terrance in this world of white vs black you can only take 1 side. what do u consider yourself 
18:56,19:50, "as per Gwede's Mantashes words  Hence the NEC should also be charged with corruption because Zuma could not make decisions without their approval. Am I understanding Gwede correctly? Show us that letter! Jody is that what he says.....? i cant here him hear Mantashe will throw Zuma in the bus can someone read for him "I'm paraphrasing 
20:07,21:18, They are All in it guys... Receive letter from OB banks thanks i cant hear a word he says Job losses HE SAID "@dave that's the sad thing thanks Knight "State Capture is so huge Mmmmmm....Job losses due to corruption..... @Terence Tito I reiterate my statement the land is not all about agriculture since u are so much educated to u have a survey of how much land is used for agriculture. 
21:37,23:43, one cannot send that type of letter to someone he's never met or didn't have a relationship with. Mantashe must just tell the chair the truth l OB sent letter to GM as he read hmm ok @Sipho.....ya that is very worrying "@bushula I never once said it was only agriculture why is he reading? fraudulently created jobs Is told to read 
23:54,25:00, this was to benefit OAKBAY NOT EMPLOYEES Did someone write this on his behalf He is reading a letter from Nazim Howa. for you to know as you can't read the letter the queshin lol Xpose letter of connection as OB acknowledgement of Gpta links to state control in American and the uk mixed people of black people are black Why dont you ask as to what was their response to the letter. @Desmond my sentiments AS well.. 
25:51,27:45, @dave east We not in America He is here to mantash his evidence....lols "The narrative that blacks cannot farm or manage farms ought to stop """we'll end up with a mafia state"" as apposed to Gweeeeeeedeeeeeeeeee?"

THEY WERE NOT HERE MOSS? @Phoka Mofokeng Ya .... I don't really haha @Terence Tito she was telling u that black ppl are coming from the same africa that we live in but u did not want to hear that "dave DONT TELL US WHAT U WANT US TO KNOW NA is long gone fam its just us hating each other now 
1:15:42,1:17:31, hii please can any one will tell me on what matter is this speech going @John Doe 😂 @rifa you sound passive. and dont see that black people are at war literally. from china Europe and the world. what are u going to do when you have nothing for your children proving the ANC lied can anyone help me to tell "@bushula how can u tell me what I don't want to hear lol if u knew me ud realise I am open to any topic NP is the DA if you know your history....@JohnDoe Urhorhozu thuni gwede ngathi utyumvubo ngesandla "The DA is for whites  
1:17:36,1:18:22, so why is it tuff for black Africans to accept there heritage comes from Upper Africa. does anyone have evidence that black South Africans originated from South Africa? I'm asking @mncedisi ncokazi actually it is not. The NP was firmly absorbed into the ANC and then later integrated into the DP - which then subsequently changed its name to the DA. wrong NP idiots joined ANC after 1994 passive huh? that is rich coming from you with the little knowledge that you hve 😂.. We are taking the LAND finish and klaar "YES Watching frm Zim 'what did we know? what did we not know? what did we do? what did we not do? Zizi Kodwa The DA used to be a liberal party called the DP - but has since lost much of its liberal position in order to attract a greater following across the whole country. 
1:18:22,1:19:02, DA is not for me if we can access state capture here why not also live soccer games psl please don't bite me @Terence Tito it's bcs Africa was one with no boundaries.

1:20:05,1:21:09, painfully BORING Zizoh = D Zuma "PLEASE GO TO EFF HEADQUATERS "Sorry @mncedisi ncokazi ... Yes but only partly. The DA is not technically the NP. It just merely incorporated members of the NNP (New National Party) after the ANC had done the exact same thing. why should we not share the land with the whites? are they not south africans? should we grab land ? @Jody Brian Herman ask your Khoi clans for donnations for a ticket dave @mncedisi ncokazi So the DA is not technically the same as the NP (which was actually the NNP under Marthinus van Schalkwyk). 
1:21:14,1:22:14, "@bushula I agree with u @mncedisi ncokazi There is a fair difference between this and saying that the DA is the NP (in a literal sense) @Rifa Dzivhani My point exactly @John Doe you know where his grave is? @Rifa Dzivhani Yes we must grab this fckn land! "if u discovered the land @Nkanyiso Mathamba WHOSE GRAVE ? The Lawyer appears to be giving Gwede too much respect..His line of questioning is just guiding him..There are no hard questions at all so far...Gwede is just enjoying himself here rifa i can prove they are not south african. 
1:22:22,1:23:50, "jngle MR gwede why the boring long story who stole all our money that's all we wanna hear "dave This means Shabalala of Strd Bank was chosen by GM ON 2016 AND SIGNED THE LETTER @Rifa so what is going to help nje? "@Yose Human WMC is a misnomer or Brown SaveMYANC Whatever you wanna call your =self

"@John Doe @Zizoh HAHAHAHAHA "Adv Mokoena is leading the evidence OB Xpose them "can someone answer my question???? if you founded the land finally they got u mantashele 
1:24:49,1:25:45, @mncedisi ncokazi Well they factually do not have the same policies THIS IS NOT FUNNY JODY; ITS SERIOUS AND A THROUT WITH SLAIN @Yose Human I don't what agenda u pushing but we will not be distracted by your stupidity. yunus carrim says he's not african. hes a south african mp 4 bll Amajuba "dave "@mncedisi ncokazi one party (NP) had a policy of systematic racial relegation and oppression if wishes were fishes we would all be casting our nets so why is Zille thinking that colonial policies were right? 
1:25:51,1:27:03, Yunus carrim hahaha rifa just look at the video u said uou want proof. Zille is pure racist @mncedisi ncokazi now you might validly be able to criticise the DA's free market policies of perpetuating existing privilege within the market - but to equate this with the Apartheid is a misnomer "@Zizoh What about Black Monoply Capital THEY MISS THE APARTHEID GOVERNMENT COZ NOW THEY CAN SEE THAT THEIR LAND IS BEING TAKEN GM never knew "JODY @Zizoh who is they ? 
1:27:07,1:28:07, WE WANT EQUALITY YOU @Zizoh the whites need to leave South Africa yes yunus carrim says hes not african but represents South Africans. i have the video on my channel @Zizoh But I don't harper for the times of Apartheid "@Zizoh I hope you get a fair playing field one day dave east..answer what i have asked you..is yunus a representative of white ppl in douth africa? does he speak for them or for himself? @Zizoh I actually abhor the systematic oppression rendered by the National Party upon the majority black population of South Africa "JODY 
1:28:10,1:28:42, @Jngle Pssy Nobody is gonna be leaving u cnt have equality without treating those around u equally yunus is just an individual he does not represent anyone I wish for everybody to exist in peace and be able to pursue their happiness however they see fit @Jngle Pssy Becareful they don't deport you for hate speech This young man thought we were playing here THANK YOU JOHN FOR YOUR ADMISSION BUT U HAVE MISSED THE PRIVILEDGE PART @ John can you just explain the Zille public promotion of the colonial policy if her party does not believe in them... so long as no harm is rendered upon those around you 
1:28:51,1:29:39, WHHITE PEOPLE DIDNT WANT TO SHARE DURING APARTHEID @Zizoh Should I give you my money ? THEY WERE SELFISH AND KILLED US please provide bank details I don't have much though @Zizoh It was Apartheid "NO @Terence Tito. The narrative that whites found some unoccupied land in SA is nonsensical! It originates from their skewed history to justify their colonial occupation of SA! @Zizoh I unfortunately do not own any land 
1:29:46,1:30:32, Just a small apartment I rent @John How can the be peace if ur don't see a need to share the LAND? @Zizoh....who brainwashed you..... they took the land and our weed @Jody Brian Herman haha they can report me YOUR EDUCATION SYSTEM @Phoka Mofokeng I believe in sharing the land @Jngle Pssy 😂 dave east you are failing to answer the question ...does yunus represent the white population or is he just speaking for himself as an individual? 
1:30:44,1:31:42, @Phoka Mofokeng I'd like some land for myself to be honest preferably in clifton WHY WERE YOU QUIETE WHEN UR GOVNMENT WAS SLAUGHTERING OUR MOTHERS AND FATHERS? Why was ANC so brave to can summon the banks simple to specially assist Guptas account from being closed. They are not a statutory body of some sort or anything. That still puzzles me. but I will also accept Camps Bay @Jody Brian Herman they will never find me @John Doe so why u come here n talk on behalf of ppl who owns land? We want land n u must actually join then what do we want to acrhieve with the commsion Oakbay stole our money. 
1:31:58,1:33:34, @Phoka Mofokeng I don't talk on behalf of anyone haha The chair must relax pleasee...
