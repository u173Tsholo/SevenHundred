I don't care if someone with the surname ""Singh"" is black or not" we're rationing tissues now Watson bragged that his signature was on nothing he could deny everything 
1:00:09,1:01:31, "Well the EFF doesnt like you jeevan Is this man well protected? I can smell rat here after this. Malema has also not owned up to anything that he's been accused of and we all know he's not clean. "@Jack Sparrow note that I capitalised ""Black People"" as it is a defined term. So like us they cannot go vote DA because they are not white and will not benefit from Black previledges" he is in the 3pc suit mafia "Huh? @Nqwato Mmatshelane​ This guy knows his stories @Vutomi you make no sense RIP AGRIZZI.

1:14:27,1:15:48, stuffed in her wigs Agrizzi wanted to bribe but Watson was doing favours Today Agrizzi is digging his own grave to many contradictions hospitals analyses "yes Agrizzi is in hot soup He hates bribes that didn't deliver anything in return @Rejoice musrurwa ☢☣ BOSASA has done the security at O R Tambo International Airport for many years. Last week Angelo Agrizzi showed a video where a BOSASA director asked for R10 000 cash to pay for a remote control... 
1:15:53,1:17:01, "the verbal beatings shall continue "AGRIZZI IS GOING TO BE AN UNRELIABLE WITNESS "he can have two points zondo is saving him?

1:17:26,1:18:05, "Agree @Ewald Kruger kkkkkkkkkk so he agree in paying bribes that have some returns and now he is saying we shouldn`t pay bribes. Bro...stick to your story!!!!😠 This guy is flip flopping. "who says the R10 000 for a ""remote control"" was not to bribe someone to open a cargo gate illegally .... who says all this cash that was paid did not come from the massive cash heists at the airport?" judge and prosecutor are careful not to lead the witness. "yes "When lawyers ask the same question during cross examination Can they give him a short break to collect his thoughts? zondo must save this guy in order to save the reliability of his evidence in future. and also to retain his status as a credible witness. 
1:18:37,1:19:39, You are not getting the guy...listen to what he says..@Rejoice musrurwa so he is saying that the bribes did not bring any benefit????? Now he has just let all the corrupt government officials off the hook because they can now say they never influenced any contracts this is all verbal no tangible reports....hai hai hai as for nomfula wan😂😂😁 "YOU ARE IN AFRICA DO AS AFRICA "canada will invade south africa during all this distractionary termoil we are in africa. we pay bribe in any sector of gov angelo contradicting himself. If bribes are paid and you get nothing in return then no benefit no crime he is in africa and is doing what africans do @Ewald Kruger 
1:19:46,1:20:37, Do as African!!! Yhooo. What is this saying about us? Africans like bribes Canada can't invade a McDonald's the term blood diamonds comes out of africa haha "He should possibly have explained his statement about ""when in Africa do as Africans do"" and how that is a figure of speech from when in Rome @CICA - Crime Intelligence & Community Awareness a bribe on its own is a crime whether it had influence or not. @Sindiswa Moolman imagine what this guy is saying "while that may be true 
1:20:54,1:23:30, Oppenheimer is head of blood diamonds Bosas never got paid for the reports so who got paid? Nomvula?????? @Apfeswaho Vele you have a point yes. However this guy is weakening the case. is it maybe intentional Gavin Watson is no Christmasfather. so it's bribe. sent colonel Sillitoe into Sierra Leone as a mercenary with his team to sort out the blood diamonds churches are all ran by colourful scammers WHAT IF WE HAVE ALL MISSED THE REAL CRIMES? What if all that cash came from the massive heists of USD at OR Tambo international airport? tough day indeed to angelo Its a day in our lives 
1:23:41,1:25:33, Lol That OR Tambo heist i also heard that government officials were involved we are a foolish species All money came frim tenders ..ie: taxpayers money hahahahahaha noooo He’s very nervous and all over the place today. He must have gotten some serious death threats over the weekend. buddy is very methodic with his questioning STOP IT CICA.... "Everytime you see VAT being paid with your hard earned money on a till slip 
1:25:40,1:27:07, holylady 1000 Yes all the money was from tenders....his testimony since ehen he started is very clear All what he is saying is that there was NO NEED to get business through bribes. GEEZ I am having a heart attack right now!!! dont die for politicians they screwed us @Magda Seguin - yes that's what he says... what if some of it was also from the massive cash heists which occurred at OR Tambo International Airport where BOSASA had massive influence and contracts? that is what they do. CICA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Who is Seopela? 
1:27:13,1:27:59, ANC must go @Ewald Kruger obviously there was need to that is why he had to go through that way all the se old men and women should not get their pension "basically A middleman for Bosasa @Desmond Masilela they must retire without compensation "greed Agrizzilicious drop them 📂.All we invent stupid stupid laws 
1:28:02,1:28:57, @Sindiswa Moolman. Thank you Sindiswa. Chris Hani assination. Polish puppet. Now we got an Italian singing bird. Am almost sure ANC behind Chris Hani assination. @CICA - Crime Intelligence & Community Awareness high ranking officials might be involved "we are a stupid stupid race @ewald Kruger you are lying and you know it. I agree Jeevan "Everyone... take note. When you see PAYE deductions coming from your hard earned payslip NPA IS CAPTURED BIG TIME Chris Hani was killed by the ANC 
1:29:23,1:30:02, our species needs to evolve quickly Huh? 😀 😀 😀 @DoNot Lie ​@ewald Kruger you are lying and you know it. He never mentioned heists...it is speculation Agrizzilicious mention them baba @Mfundo Veerasamy. I knew NPA was capture. Why did NPA drop the case of Zuma. DJ Agrizzi drop them files @Rejoice musrurwa you have a point yes. Clearly all is not as it seems why is he not allowed to mention names? Why are they hiding the names? 
1:30:09,1:31:19, @Magda Seguin go back to sleep. what if they kill him now? "@Mfundo Veerasamy yep connection$ Why dont they want him to mention names. Us the public would like to know😂 "@ Desmond Masilela @Magda Seguin do we have need to wait to hear it from his mouth but reading between line and you will see a bit of connection @Mfundo Veerasamy. hahahahahaa the state was really captured 
1:31:20,1:32:19, @Magda Seguin if you were involved in massive cash heists would you give evidence about it? Or would you try distract with elaborate stories of cash laundering only being linked to tenders? let him mention the names HE WANTS TO GIVE THE NAMES OF NPA HIGH RANKING OFFICIALS i would be flipped out seeing on on youtube Did everyone just get disconnected or was it just me? just you #names #names please name it #agrrizi @Rejoice musrurwa exactly it was u 
1:32:20,1:33:22, just you it s us against politicians @True tech only you @Mfundo Veerasamy. I think this Inquiry is also trying to hide peoples name. i didnt get disconnected though who was the auditor of Bosasa? "oh @CICA - Crime Intelligence & Community Awareness are you saying Agrizzi or BOSASA was involved in CIT Heists? "this lawyer doesnt want Agrizzi to take out names and we waiting for those names 
1:33:23,1:35:18, "@ Desmond Masilela I wish could share the full Agrizzilicious final statement so we can also read along @Desmond that's what we think reading should be spelt reeding @ ​LADY T ask SUNDAY TIMES THEY HAVE IT ALREADY "Me and my big mouth @UNdlunkulu Xoli research the massive Cash heists which occurred at OR Tambo International Airport...

1:40:40,1:41:50, NAMES ARE COMING LADIES AND Gentleman Remember the massive heists which happened at OR Tambo International Airport? Ask yourself whether it is impossible that BOSASA and others were involved is Garven sounds like a bit of a mafia got in on the loot payments to individuals @Mfundo Veerasamy yes agreed - at least he helped expose this. Luckily not all companies operate this way That is correct. @CICA - Crime Intelligence & Community Awareness look now Bosasa was paying correctional services employees again WHY? Commissioner is.. 
1:41:51,1:42:45, It's about to get down please arrest gavin Watson we are abt to get the names Tom Moyane Another name came in. oooh no ooom Tom moyane 750K Moyane is an Idiot "kickbacks 
1:43:13,1:45:09, No wonder Tom has so much money to waste defending his case Gavin passport must be confiscated "@Rejoice musrurwa apparently they paid Correctional Services to get tenders. Maybe they also paid for dangerous perpetrators to be ""lent"" to them for crimes and high risk work" idiocy is somewhat of a requirement You have a point there @CICA - Crime Intelligence & Community Awareness WHY IS GAVIN WATSON NOT IN A HOLDING CELL YET? (In a prison which is not managed by BOSASA) "wow all this mafia @CICA - Crime Intelligence & Community Awareness The same reason NO minister/deputy minister/politician is in a holding cell.
