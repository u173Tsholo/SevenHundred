As a precautionary measure So the guy dont wanna be seen. and he dont wanna mention names. Whats the point of his protection... wasteful expenditure for us to get to know the truth means we need to know them @Eliot Chauke I too dont get it. What a waste of our time. I wanna watch his body language.. 
20:31,22:30, Zintle they tried to kill him many time because he spilled the beans now he must be protected. the names are already provided but because of witness sensitivity the codes must be used He is not lying. cant wee see him He's a thug too..

54:39,55:25, "Munsamy Ranjeni again. Ayeye ranjeni Rajeni! her car was paid up Ranjeni again? tjoooooooooo Rangeni again Who is Ranjeni? If i may Ranjeni 
56:03,58:56, Divisional Commissioner Mpheko is the current advisor to the deputy president of the country Zintle she is Sunday Times journalist Yes crook @i am free honestly speaking SA is not yet open to open 2 equal opportunity for all .I have dreams in life which are posible but cos chances are not given the same 4 all races that dream is stil far "morning everybody The Chair is in charge and I like it.😆😆 Ndlozi told us that Rajeni and few of her colleagues are embedded journalists hired to advance an agenda of certain politicians. now stories are coming Ju Ju going to be happy🤣🤣🤣 Hendrix he is under witness protection 
59:25,1:01:35, Sounds like the Chair is playing a role of the Evidence Leader "James Godloza Godloza  "Gee we need to be honest with ourselves.....at the moment we are buying faces at an expennse of truth Sindi and he is doing perfectly fine. asu "how can an Indian not know how to pronunce we already know his house is in kempton park So Ranjenis account with WesBank was paid and the maintenance thereof done and costs covered by the CI 
1:02:14,1:03:52, Moonsamy or Musammy @i am free I don't beliv in materialism too .all I nid is 2 provide for my kids and my immediate family.and that can happen if I persuey my dream.but honestly it can't hapen now cos cronyism "@lisanda I can see the WITNESS can you? Gee yes @ Lisanda 04....😂😂😂😂😂 "@Lorraine Naidoo But how can he be unsure of how he got there? Ok 
1:04:05,1:06:11, Are you a ghostbuster @Born Free? I wonder how much more will be revealed when general Mdluli has to come here He's a spy... he cant give all details... just like Zuma did... 'i dont know' Born free where do u see the witness I have incredible insight the guy is indian in he cant pronounce indian names Look at the reflection in Judge Zondo's glasses "Born free ​I  "if every one is captured  
1:06:12,1:09:27, its muntu maragan😂😂😂😂😂😂 SABC camera man is EXTRA — showing an empty witness stand on Camera while is presented in camera😝 @Gee 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Why do they show us an empty chair instead of focusing the camera on the chair and the evidence leader @Mario Johnson because her surname is spelt Munusamy. Maybe there are others where the u is silent and others pronounce it with the u. The witness has a mustache he he he she said nothing like that her attorney is dealing with that Jenny is caught I. her lies ok👍 is new world moters in Robertshem 
1:09:35,1:12:02, The witness he's not present? "@sindiswa i think thats why they call it state capture "@Peter🤣🤣 "can imagine cross examining a spy The Witness is actually sitting somewhere else in the room. Incase SABC stuff up. "Camera man is silly She's in hiding Ranjeni was spoilt yho. The car doesn't start she calls crime intelligence? Wow The final report is expected in June 2020. But he promised us an interim report so that the Hawks and others can start their jobs 
1:12:06,1:14:59, Gee Pix or gin "yeer pheladi thanx sindiswa so are they going to put tea on the witness stand? its tea time now🤣🤣 That's why Zuma had all these crime intelligence on his side "ramuseny she must be struck off the roll .anther Gupta "@Sindiswa Moolman he must expedite the interim reporting Only now she’s no longer a friend of Zuma and Malema @olebile olebile 
1:15:27,1:18:58, Agreed @Sihle Xhakaza ithink there is enough evidence to arrest someone now I'm starting to admire cln Naidoo's bravery for spinning the bean even if it may has to cause his life "For those with short memories. In the earlier days of Zuma being Deputy President and then President The commission has enough evidence to give the NPA to start prosecutions and arrests . "galore evidence. how agreezy is roaming the streets after such explosive evidence I remember @Pastor J. She was also a spokesperson for Friends if Zuma cabal yes 100% correct Sindiswa "olebile olebile 
1:19:26,1:24:38, was mac maharaj not the spokesperson though? @olebile olebile I cannot recall Agrizzi implicating his wife? @Immanuel Yes he also was a spokesperson at some time I wonder whether or not his evidence may end up roping in Zuma somewhere somehow? 😂😂😂 It just goes to show ... people are not what the seem. used to follow her on twitter. @Gee Peex1 Remind me please. How was she implicated? "@geepix  should there be no arrests and convictions (I mean pleanty of them )they should just stop this commissions! enough is enough .. @Gee Peex1 I cant accept that in any shape or form to be implicated in State Capture. My wife tells me everyday to be careful. What should that mean? 
1:27:08,1:31:07, hallala peeps and how are we all doing @Gee Peex1 . I must be clear that I am not playing ignorant on this aspect but I am ignorant. I did not hear any evidence as such to hide illicit dealings...... Sihle I fully agree with you. i think i should borrow Zondo my watch coz his is always behind "@Edmond how long is tea time kant? @Pastor J I'm picking up stompies. Didn't Agrizzi's wife get paid a salary but didn't work at Bosasa? Why is the journalist car being serviced by the Crime Intelligence Morning Danie @Danie Nilsen 
1:31:08,1:33:22, @Anne M. . My understanding of that aspect was to lighten the tax burden. Possibly a form of tax evasion. I think the commission must investigate the tshilidzini hospital for corruption that the doctors are doing there "@Edmore  "Yes "Hello folks is fm 09 part of SABC or private radio station? becoz when people got admitted they have to pay from R200 to R400 for the beds Hi Rhudi H @Kay Kay they are codes given to various people in crime intelligence 
1:33:35,1:35:57, "after this commission has concluded its function another one must be constituted to inquire why the zondo commission was not conscious on time or time management is wanting Ranjeni is busy wth her response to all these allegations against her. She’s working with her attorneys as we speak. So guys be ready... she’s coming here. "Thanks peeps "is what am asking myself too  @Kay Kay lol i thought so myself that we wrapped up sabc and only know FM2000 names if the other journos also Please "Yes what time does the break end? My money is on an implicated person's lawyer who is talking to DCJ in chambers 
1:36:11,1:42:50, Will Resume Shortly... thank you 🙏 "@Willie this commission is not doing well on time management akere?🤷‍♀️ lol i am late as usual and started from the begining and are not on the tea brake yet zondo is about to sneeze is the rea brake still on "Ranjeni is treated like a Queen with CI doing her errands regards Car Yeh Great Asset to them 
1:43:11,1:46:27, but now a liability to Tax Payer @gee payments were approved by FM100🤣 i am at a car of 40k claim Maybe he still had the flu @Heather Cotton and judge has a towel on his face Has @Heather Cotton Zondo has a big babelas Zomdo has morning sickness eight years in wp! 
1:46:51,1:49:29, To much for this Zando Commissioner The poor judge is not well for a long time now. ahhh witness protection for 8 years and still counting🤷‍♀️ wow msanzi @Gee Peex1 please use double M.... Mmusi Who has put him on this WP programme? "judge not well ... until all criminals are in jail. cameraman please keep the camera away whenever Zondo has cotton to his nose it looks unprofessional. thank you "I do not think judge is going to make it through the day 
1:49:32,1:53:52, "oopsie I can't wait for the outcome of the state capture "@Getty Mabunda I am affraid you will have to wait until the year 2040 Hybo "@Getty Mabunda then i will not hear the outcome i will not reach mugabes milesSTONE that will be crap "looo Tshawa I agree with you. Zando needs ext for star capture for anther 6 months "if judge doesn't have a break 
1:54:05,2:00:01, What is wrong with Zondo or did he eat some Gupta curry? "2002 col was a clerk then in 2010 promoted to liue col His got flue covert fund aka open checkbook Zondo needs to lose some weight @SABC Digital News What's happening? Are they still on break? "If Judge Zondo leaves early today "no i think the tecnicians are under cover now 
2:01:07,2:03:14, what is his police training history. where did he train. cousins no history boss jumped from psa ckerk to w/0 cousins make dozens "@Michael Wild African only if you got cousin's That would be a very big issue that someone with no police training records would be working for our top spy network. Are there technicians in Naidoo's room or how was the sound gonna be fixed? true i did not apply for an promotion so my hod did it for me lol 
2:03:32,2:09:54, I think the witness is in the same building.. ya same room he is floor 4 room 302 now the journys start running Isn't it more about the secret location than his identity? Gigiba "The damm cameraman is annoying now Naidoo is he also cousin Many "Zondo is sharp actually Mdluli let's hear now 
2:10:13,2:16:43, where is advocate Maleka? "i will be feeling the same as this evidence is going nowhere Gen Mdluli and his involvements.... "I think they should let witness speak openly 😪😪@Kay Kay. any reason that you know of? briliant people make briliant desisions maleka was boring with a fake accent "I learn it here also that Maleka left beki Cele 
2:16:45,2:18:49, Mdluli needs an orange jumpsuit Eish... scary stuff is that the reason why he left the commission? @morena ateo very scary 🤔 Thanks@kay Kay bheki is involved what?? Beki Cele became wealthy of what? Who is clean mare? y is he saying he dont no anything that is true abt mr cele 
2:19:04,2:20:21, bheki tele technicians are suspect!!!! no one ....@Tumi "Mdluli is a big friend of Zuma There seems to be so much this witness doesnt recall. "Cele is corrupt eish beki Cele just see if they are green and you will know beki cele 
2:20:39,2:22:23, "If this witness never exposed his house details come people its obvious the techs are interfering with the sound equipment!!!!!!! @Rudi H please explain the fedora is it like a cricket cup but only worn in court for a low blow Our only minister who is trying his best to do his job now he is also implicated why is Zondo talking so soft? """im not sure"" ""I can not recall"" ""I can not remember""" CIC'S SOURCES ARE RELIABLE. JOURNALIST ARE BEING PAID BY GOVERNMENT. It sounds like Judge Zondo has a cold Judge Zondo is having flu 
2:22:25,2:25:28, @TheC4RB1N3 . The chair is under weather lol wat is really happening here @Danie Nilsen it’s that mafia hat he wears everyday mr witness i suggest put ur facts down properly Zondo is careful with this witness "@Rosza cossack stop with ur i cant remember i think so i assume maybe i cannot recall ur evidence is going to turn against you "@Danie Nilsen exactly 
2:25:33,2:27:17, Spill the beeeans! come on he is more fluent by not remember or recall than zuma was look at the point u made now its not in ur favour "this witness is playing mind games unreliable witness? why did he out it in the statement in the first place.😭 "This witness is not sure what he should say "This witness I THINK THE WITNESS WILL CONTRADICT HIMSELF JUST WAIT AND BE PATIENCE!!!!!!!!!!! 😎😎😎😎😎 selective memory of this witness i can discern 
2:27:23,2:28:29, @Eagle Eye I agree "There's a gap how do you have 40grand and not know why you had it "The implicated people will have to give statements now ​I THINK THE WITNESS WILL CONTRADICT HIMSELF JUST WAIT AND BE PATIENCE!!!!!!!!!!! 😎😎😎😎😎 surely they can hear the feedback on sound "@ Eagle Eye  agreed.. @ Eagle Eye This witness is a liar. 
2:28:46,2:31:18, Yes too many assumptions are not assisting the commission "But tell me something Zondo is literally saying do not lie @Kay Kay very eloquently so! Former Crime intelligence member Colonel Dhanajaya Gangulu Naidoo will continue with his Law Enforcement related testimony before the commission. #StateCaptureInquiry how do you remember this?? im not saying hes a liar im saying put ur thoughts down on paper if that will make u remember but just get ur story straight this is a very important hearing now u contradicting urself on assumptions He was not at the meeting but he assumes it was given to gen Cele.This guy is lying 
2:31:29,2:33:25, assumptions must now stop...👺👺👺 "Zondo must get Mdluli to give a statement after this Yes Rosa and Sihle i agree that the assumptions must stop @Gee Peex1 my last day? Gee Peex 1 you dont simply believe that do you? who is beki jele? does anyone know? This Commission lack 1 thing... Liar Detector Test. could've saved out Tax. and this whole process could've concluded long time ago. Gee Peex this has nothing to do with the Gupta's please 🤣🤣🤣 this lady's pronunciation of Cele is hilarious 
2:33:32,2:34:15, "yoh the way people abuse X d they mean bheki cele Who is Beki Jele? Celia again "There you have it "fire the technicians Bheki Cele she's racist. she has no respect for African names 
2:34:24,2:35:37, This assumption story will weaken his testimony When does mrs smith get here? @Gee Peex1 some people just know when green people know other green people @Eliot Chauke Don't be dumb Lol... What can this witness RECALL? Eliot Chauke you should know well there is no master of pronunciation "Hi Eliot another assumption !! hay. 
2:35:39,2:36:56, this is the nature of bribes tho "Ask Eliot "that word ""racesist"" does not sit well for me" how do we spell Manimoto? Can't find him on Google. why does he assume the money was given to Mr. Cele? Say No to Racism "Assumptions - Assumptions - Assumptions.... Ai maan try marimuthu Marimuthu 
2:37:16,2:38:40, no to racism Yip I didn’t answer that question "@Christiaan Kleynhans​ I'm searching for the spirit of the great heart where does racism come into this chat the judge is on a roll now and is rolling this witness "now fellow South Africans  how is easy is it to get the truth out of a spy? I truly lost as to what racism has to do with this chat. 
2:38:44,2:39:52, we are having a intelligent conversation here and then racism comes in @Sihle Xhakaza Injalo nje! what's up cannot hear is it lunch this witness is wasting my data😭 @kay u need to be a spy to get the truth from a spy. @Sihle Xhakaza yes the percentage is a bit low thoughthe green people should be close to 98 persent why they are hiding him Sihle yes 
2:39:53,2:42:39, "Zondo getting down to facts Zondo has now put on his real judge jacket to nail this witness tayo So this witness has been put on witness protection for all his assumptions..... I guess this is a waste of state resources Judge Zondo is really interrogating this witness now..... Lol "judge may be unwell Vrrrrrrr Pha!!! DCJ yes indeed this judge is excellent "Zondo is on Fire now 
2:42:46,2:44:40, "He is helping the commission by giving evidence DCJ at his best✌️✌️✌️ Isn't Zondo busy with low key type of cross examination? No! hey wena witness protection for what?? "I think he is getting to the truth He is helping the witness give more accurate statements "Kay "This happened 10 years ago 
2:45:19,2:47:39, Yhooooo all India nd in kzn No chair no chair was said 23 times when jugde started to sqeeze his nuts "i wish people can also understand when President Zuma say Here comes the rain this witness got PTSD after all his experiences with crooks "oh nkosi Yami no chair @Person of interest 😂 do not be dumb it was a snake 
2:48:25,2:49:45, Mdluli = the laanie 🤦🏽‍♂️😱 R50 000 pocket change "With all this money thats been stolen from the poor oh sorry i thought it was a snake "50k 40k  R296 BILLION stolen in 5 years and getting worse Naidoo's an old Shad poacher of note. They all became Lanie @Nash Aniruth if that is so then the white capitalist are found inocent
