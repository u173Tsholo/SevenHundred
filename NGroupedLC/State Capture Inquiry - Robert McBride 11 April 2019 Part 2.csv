time,9:30,message and we back Robert McBride we back Hello this guy will have plenty of info on all the ministers "Them all Especially former SAPS ministers @kevindbn007 "problem is 
10:15,14:55, but these ppl need o be held to account "For an informative background Jirr i remember the fight between Ntlemeza and Mbalula Ok Robby. Let‚Äôs go fethu. better start building lots of jails. You reckon people are gonna really end up in jail? yes if the course of this enquiry is to fix SA then yes. Julian Arrange arrested.El Bashir resigned ...news of the day The guy is gonna tell how state policing and prosecutorial functions were captured. 
15:07,17:17, @Micheal Wild üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ So let‚Äôs keep our fingers crossed. I think every south African needs to take to the streets till justice is served not just for the nyumpis @Dianne I read the Amabhungane article...The names are all there but for the big boys Crime Intelligence was rotten under Mdluli. After Dramat was fired the case was dismissed. like Zuma until they are prosecuted we will never see the end as what do the next in line have to fear "I know he will probably say what he is here for 
17:27,21:18, If this commission fail to recommend prosecutions than nothing else will rescue these beautiful country Elson. absolutely correct. This how Zuma was starting more to capture the state Charges... @Bongumenzi...capture of the state judiciary Ace Magushle and Zuma are heavily connected in the state capture for years. how can we are we cowards ? "@Eslon Eslon The new PP is busy putting together the ""New Scorpions 2"" that will investigate and prosecute all implicated by this and other(PIC) commissions." are we so easily quelled by a show they put a circus to make us happy ? 
21:31,25:35, is this what south africa should settle for "@jeevan Singh guys is it me or I AM TIRED OF BEING UNEMPLOYED! everytime i watch state capture hope just fades awayüòû I geuss so In white rules never be any state capture "If these comrades were then in preview of this attempt to capture UBUNTU white and black is how they redirect our anger that is meant for them anyone want GANGSTER STATE...there is a garage full 
25:48,27:20, "Sheila Betohi is going to fast track state capture prosecutions  "@Cerebis "But we were told this fellow is coming here to implicate folks involved in State Capture @Eslon Eslon realy "why is pretorius stop mcbride on certian statements it's time for justice from Zuma to everyone we must even put Mugabe in chains should he ever dare to enter our land It is the so called Zimbabwe rendition Shamilla Batohi Magda Seguin @Magda Seguin ...it's Shamila Batohi 
27:35,30:37, She is the new NPA Director "@Eslon Eslon sorry the time is now to become what we are meant to be or our children will face the consequences The rendition was a set up against Dramat and McBride " @Spindle yes..it was a mistake "@Cerebis My autocorrect seems to be active I need to delete it again in what way does he do that 
31:00,34:09, "Our leaders are mostly corrupt  "Every president or prime minister in this world rule countries with business people nyoape is the result of drug dealers they even make a drug that makes poor people even worse off then before the drug dealers are the result of corruption trickling down ok sound reasoable "sound here where I live the only ones to chase Nigerians from their local corner it was a small malawian community not the cops not us south Africans it was malawians speaks volumes about why we in this state "@magda yes you will mnot hear the v live chat it has no audioiü§£ 
34:11,35:58, that is very true Mhle i fully agree with u business first Couldn't McBride not have provided this testimony with the Mkgoro commission? "I'm not ANC no ! it doesnt matter what race we are it matters what we do about this corruption we are to docile they legalized marijuana to make us even more docile go away1 here are bombs Mokgoro commission was for what again? So many commissions I have lost count they believe order trumps justice 
36:14,38:49, see again a block is there any explosive evidence mcbride said since he took the stand? no nada zilch kuafela @Bongumenzi Nxumalo This evidence is led to demonstrate how state security agencies were weakened and repurposed to serve a particular purpose. Therefore it does not belong to the Mokgoro commission Who send white jail when they were eating RSA money? He confirms how crime intelligence fabricated a case against the national and Gauteng heads of Hawks. Pheladi Lamola It was to probe the fitness to hold office of suspended NPA Advocates Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi That idiot parody bary roux spoke about this not prosecuting government officials isn't just a south African thing it's a world wide thing here in africa we are more blessed because over here they are too stupid to go about their business with 
38:52,41:26, tact but now fabrication of 1 case does it forms part of state capture? "Dumile Mateza True @peter read the Amabhungane article...it is very long buy explains everything we no longer on state capture. we on rendition case about mcbride friend sibiya where is Mbalula? has Mc Bride spilled any beans? Did I miss something? @peter...the rendition is just ONE example of state capture same 
41:35,45:20, The head of Hawks was targeted because they had started to investigate certain connected people so they had to be booted out of the service It shows how McBride and Dramat was being falsely implcated as they were deemed hindrances No Mhle corrupt people must be tried and be jailed if fund to have performed any wrong doing by the african courts not by the ICC is this ipid same as old russians KGB ? "Those against state capture was flushed out...just like at the SOE's...they were either suspended Is this the Terrorist McBride who murdered all those innocent people at Magoo's. Yes of course it is I was in school 80s I know what I'm talking about. why taking so long to prosecute "@Val Speirs  
45:21,47:17, thought so the first time I ever went to a court to bail a friend the schedule wasnt up so I asked a judge walking by the first thing he said was ask for a bribe corruption even in courts is that common place @Danie Nilsen IPID is not the same as the old KGB. I think it's State Security (could be wrong) val speirs it is him the freedom fighter himself. @mvubu 1234 my sentiments exact mc bride is so bitter and desperate IPIID is the department that looks into Police corruption You are right Anne M...IPID oversees SAPS i know it is him he was braging about in durban head office amonst his comarads of the scteaming like pigs and chaos 
47:32,49:34, @peter sikoshule why are you saying that @peter sikoshule Seems like he is more honest that the entire ANC combined. "@Danie Nilsen No @Peter why do you say so?What do you know? @peter sikoshule He was proven right on the case that he is testifying about now I'd bet my last dollar everyone watching this has paid a bribe before "so i just want to know All the names are coming out!..All of them are in the Amanghubane article @Kapn Krunch Then you will lose your bet 
49:43,51:31, @Thapelo it's all in the public domain for 10 years "@Anne M. i do not see the function they had or that they knew what they were suppose to do "@Kapn Krunch  @Mzalwane Mzala McBride has his own agenda. I wish I understood him. I reather like how he is blowing lid off some holy cows - wonder he might want to hold back however? not even for drunk driving ? dont lie "@Danie Nilsen IPID investigates complaints against the police #Thapelo ... because üí∞ talks and üí© Walks üòâ "@Kapn Krunch  Did you know that when you accept a free t-shirt or groceries or meal pack its a bribe.... 
51:32,53:03, I've bribed a cop with a coffee because it was all I had back when I used to drive without a license "Then you are apart of the problem https://amabhungane.org/stories/saps-wars-part-3-bheki-cele-robert-mcbride-and-the-mysterious-mr-marimuthu/ But McBride as much as he is spilling beans.. He must mention names that were behind this attempt to capture everything by any means!! Agrizzi set a tone that all should follow I know he will be cross examined so u guys will understand why I say he is bitter and desperate. Let me not talk too much Is he saying Mrs Mbeki? "@Norman Zwane This is case number 1 that he is testifying on. I do not want to speculate on what is still to come. On this one That is why it is called Independent Police Investigation Directorate...Nd Bride was the Director until his contract was not renewed recently by Cele He is mentioning names!! 
54:03,55:28, "@Mzalwane Mzala yeah I agree one needs to not speculate but let this play itself out the clown is back #ryan john Oh pullleeaase üëπüëøüëéüèª we should all block this fool It is a fact that Mcbride did for IPID what Thuli Madonsela did for Public Protector ofice. "#Briony French ... Yip I hope we are surprised I really do I hope this time next year justice will be served He fought for the independence of IPD and took Ministers to court for meddling in IPID's work @Moira T I have already reported his comments and his channel with nothing on it. 
55:33,57:45, "ok then i am right of my mental thinking it was a office job with no real investigation why will corrupt college we all knew exactly what was happening when they disbanded the scorpions Kuki SA is a dying nation Eish! Kuku vele vele??? @Mzalwane Mzala it's become common place so common place that we accept it "@Mzalwane Mzala  #Briony French ... as we have become acutely aware ... only Truth is Blocked ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è NWO Ntelemeza was Head of Hawks who sent Gordhan the 27 questions after he was recalled from London on an investment trip and then dropped when Zuma reshuffled Parliament 
57:50,1:01:30, Hayi @Norman Zwane @Mzalwane Mzala I'd go home early if I were you...your mind is not here lol I must actually leave this and start writing. Not parliament but Cabinet Is giving evidence like an oral examination "no south africa is only contaminated by a small group of people all previous terro @Dumile Mateza Majored tone more convincing than the erratic tone of Vytjie all of that chair all of that peace Danie 
1:01:43,1:03:53, the terrorists are just a medium that are used to sack our country there are far bigger players that are never named that benefit the most Some Sunday Times journalists was used by the NPA to publish leaked info...I think General Booysen will still testify after McBride the terrorists have the trust of the people that trust is merely exploited @Norman Zwane YOU MENAT TO SAY MEASURED INSTEAD OF MAJORED peace william pieters however if we prosecute those who are named the next person in that position of power will think twice before they do the unnameds bidding @Dumile Mateza lol Yeah I MENAT that!!! General Booysen will testify on Monday it's a step in the right direction 
1:05:26,1:08:22, that tinfoil hat sits firmly upon my head "all we want is to see is recovery of money stolen money of tax payers ENGLISH!! She is not our mother's tounge @Dumile Mateza @gerald mokonyane when it is paid back why will it not be stolen again because all the crooks are still there? Gerald I agree with u . this rendition case won't help us recover the money @gerald people don't realise how enormous the damage is...billions upon billions of taxpayers money including tax evasion by Zuma and his friends It lool @peter sikoshule the money will never be recovered prosecution will we musnt just send them to jail we should strip them of their illicit wealth that includes those who benefitted from friends to family 
1:08:35,1:12:27, It appears that Mr Pretorious has a chip on his shoulder with McBride...they are both from KZN DJ we won't recover all of it but we will get some not enough to help this country out to be stolen again the judicial process of prosecuting the gangsters will take its coures "@peter sikoshule Is he not using the Rendition case to make some point? I may be reading too much into his approach big no slag hulle Robert Norman in the rendition case there was no money involved . it was just saps infighting ( crime intelligent and hawks) and protection of criminals by covering up evidence 
1:12:41,1:16:55, belief is important if we believe we are powerless we are powerless The Hawks üëø Captain Lemoer is a criminal So MR Khuba are they referring to Khuzani Mpungose or ?? Phiyega tipped Lemoer off about his eminent suspension our law is too generous and takes long even though the evidance is obvious south africa is one of the 10 countries with the best human rights in the world it's time to start exercising them you right there @Kapn Krunch .

1:28:51,1:30:18, @Fils de l'homme why should i? Oupa Zwane I wish I had the answer but I don't.. interesting question but all my busness mail is in gauteng i will go bankrupt because of a name "@Kapn Krunch Join us The ANC likes using dirty tricks...only the brainwashed are fooled @carnoth ngomane bcz the current BAntu leadership has failed the taxes without the corruption will ensure equality of opportunity for everyone Both Mr Pretorious and the Judge are hard on McBride...seems like the brother's implication is a factor @Fils de l'homme but you never explained to me what is the freedom of transvaal 
1:30:38,1:34:13, "Putting our dirty linen to the outside world to judges us @Fils de l'homme that will never happen! "@carnoth ngomane we want to rebuild the TRANSVAAL with the Project which was written in 1999 Mcbride's confidence is super high @Fils de l'homme who wrote the project and why? @Oupa right now in the US Mueller is investigating Trump...it's very ugly.You can listen to US Congress hearings on YouTube...three of Trumps lawyers have been jailed already. the original builders of South Africa scrip not project @Thando Nkutha ....looks like last weeks lotto numbers to me 
1:34:19,1:36:30, Half of Trumps initial appointed government officials have resigned or was fired. Everything is about due course @Fils de l'homme you seem to be stuck in the past so i will pass The Mueller investigation has been completed and it does not recommend any action against President Trump. Corruption is a global problem...even two of Brazil's ex presidents are in jail or stuck in a bottle of Klippies @carnoth ngomane what does the future look to u like? @carnoth ngomane do u trust those bantu's in power after 25 years? @Cerebis Barr has backtracked...he also only gave a reduced version of the report. Everybody in the US wants the full report to be made public. 
1:36:35,1:37:56, shot.... üòÉ Thando @Fils de l'homme yes and on the 8th of May they will retain power Remember Barr is a Trump ally between the buttocks @carnoth ngomane but do u trust that things will get better for you? @Tony Page vote for the FREEDOM of TRANSVAAL Mzulusi should also be jailed to instil responsibility to the coming president @Tony it's a dirty @Fils de l'homme absolutely 
1:37:59,1:39:51, @Thando Nkutha. Since this morning there was a like of in due course. And he has never went back to that issue. Just now the chair will adjourn and will not hear that due course. "No chance @Magda Seguin The brief of the Mueller special investigation was clear. Establish f Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russians. @carnoth ngomane u r makin a mistak with those bantus Trump is the best @Fils de l'homme rather them than you and your transvaal group "@Cerebis And @Magda Seguin I think you mean to say everybody in the Dems want the whole report. Some info will be secret and will be excluded. I really honour the people of Sudan in the way they took so Bashir down...they came out in their hundreds of thousands since December 2018 until he resigned today 
1:40:23,1:42:33, it is difficult to govern a house what about a goverment where there are a lot of oily hands and at the time 25 years ago empty pockets now it is full and might go better or is it wishfull thinking Please explain The Freedom of Transvaal and is it exclusively white or does it include other ethnics? @Val Speirs Transvaal residents are mixed @Cerebis...look at all rhevinterviews of prominent US citizens on all the tv stations apart from Fox that Trump use as his mouthpiece... @Val Speirs we will create settlements for all ppl group val no it can not be white who will do the work The Dems are actually lame ducks apart from when Pelosi refused the wall money @Val Speirs we will need BANTU labour to build But you say it will not work with Bantu people..!??? 
1:42:34,1:44:21, Comrades fighting one another through commissions! The demise of ANC #@Val Speirs what do u mean? Trump is not inbred and neither am I. @Val Speirs what d u mean? "The demise of the ANC was proclaimed since its formation in 1912 and the ANC still here @Bongumenzi Nxumalo not the demise rather a wake up call @Val Speirs I guess it's a matter of opinion. is it possable for them ever wake up and to what @Cerebis follow AOC and the Young Turks on Twitter and you will get a picture of Trumps madness 
1:44:59,1:46:52, Freedom of Transvaal sounds like colonies for different races or what? @Anne M. No Watson has be charged or prosecuted in SA yet in regards to this commision. Most of us however hope that they will!!?? "Mzalwane Mzala Its not the total loss or collapse "@Mzalwane Mzala its only a wish for may people but it will never happen I think this testimony is boring....... I am actually surprised that there are two or thre discussions taking place on this platform. The whites are talking to each other and blacks talking to each other. "These subtitles though üòÇüòÇüòÇ what language are some of the words they are writing here. Appreciating that they are doing it for the deaf @Bongumenzi Nxumalo Correct - the ANC is a shadow of what it was before. i think we the people of south africa should think of a federal state wher each one can decide in what state he or she will be comfortable 
1:47:07,1:49:17, @Magda Seguin I stay away from Twitter....it is mostly for Twits. I however believe that Trump is an unstable liar that proves that anybody can become POTUS. @Derek Main and thanks to this commission ANC will go back to basics and redress @Magda Seguin ... I don't want to be personal.... but if i may ask where do you live and what do you do for a living... or your background... your knowledge is indeed impressive @carnoth ngomane Don't hold your breath. The ANC is too corrupt to self-correct. I am only on Twitter for the credible academic work I am involved in but I also take note of world affairs as I need to know the political dynamic to do my work including the financial markets. "trump is the best president the WORKD have ever experiance Trump is the greatest President the US will ever have. There economy is booming and Trump is not bought by the beurocr @Robert I can't sorry "@Derek Main 
1:49:23,1:51:09, Some people‚Äôs names here give an impression that they are intelligent until they say something. It‚Äôs really disappointing. @Derek Main it will eventually the passed 10 years must be a warning to many of us @Robert thanks for the compliment. @Eslon Eslon That is true but I think the rot started before him. He just took it to it's logical conclusion. political prisoners must go for trauma counseling. they still carry lot of scars. @Bongumenzi Nxumalo I responded to the word 'demise' and I believe I was correct. "Sindiswa Moolman  @carnoth ngomane let them keep on wishing @carnoth ngomane And yet you'll vote for the same party that brought all this destruction to SA institutions. How is that going to work? 
1:51:25,1:53:21, i agree with u aslon fully "Mzalwane Mzala My bad Again stage one load shedding @Val Speirs Republicans / Democrats - all the same - equally influenced by lobbyists and money. I always maintained that debriefing is important for proper integration @peter @carnoth ngomane The ANC have been making mistakes for decades and still they hven't learnt from it. High risk of stage 1 of load shedding "@Val Speirs I agree with you in general Ngomane correct 
1:53:22,1:55:09, @Derek Main and Yes i will vote for ANC its no secret "@centane Ngomane me too.y not?? Wonderful Derek yes but not Trump. @carnoth ngomane The I say you are a fool. You've heard all evidence of corruption and you're voting for more of it. @Derek Main how many decades Derek who must we vote @Val Speirs You're delusional - Trump is a gangster. 
1:55:09,1:56:42, "I beg to disagree with you "All of this greed can be directly linked to officials doing business with the state @carnoth ngomane 2 1/2 so far There was a commission to look at Phiyegas tenure but unfortunately the Judge who led the commission died halfway and it was never made public Elson bcz Msholozi he is corrupt Mbeki did not use the Guptas to undermine our democracy like Zuma did @Derek Main your insults wont change my mind set. ANC all the way otherwise there's no alternative @carnoth ngomane I'm not trying to change your mind - I'm just telling you you're a fool. Trump is the best . This country is riddled with State Gangsters 
1:56:46,1:58:34, Did e die @Magda Seguin? Yhooo "let's not forget Phiyega was suspended due to Marikana..I don't even know if she was finally let go @carnoth ngomane That Derek is only here to insult ANC and its supporters. @Derek Main i will take that as a complement and acceptance of defeat @carnoth ngomane Glad you're admitting defeat. as was aparheid a heinious crime thought out by politicians and acepted by the white voters it must be noted not all white people did suport it that is why there was a white State Capture started in 1994 Mcbribe speaks with an accent when nervous 
1:58:35,1:59:28, State capture started before 1994 opposition and as time went on the mistake became clear "@Dumile Mateza Val b4 that wt waz happening in the country?? @Mzalwane Mzala i work with people like him when they cant get you to agree with them the resort to insults and corruption gets death by hanging. @Eslon Eslon It's the ANC's problem - collective responsibility. State capture got worse in 1994 The issue i needed to get my head around was that when Zuma came into power he institued an investigation into the State Owned Enterprises. What did the report tell him and hwat became of the SOEs 
1:59:37,2:00:16, Bring back the death sentence hanging sounds fair "Derek main is desperate to persuade people join him Val started when?? "the root of all this Mbeki has been the best president to date and likely to be best african son ever "People are free to vote for whoever they want to.

That they are not fit to hold office or what? @Eslon Eslon We can only speculate for now as the report has not been made public. same here' "I guess the president want to consider their statements before he take a final decision. It sounds like the recommendation is to fire them truth is jiba and mrwebi can't go back to npa. they will be batohi biggest treats. president must stop being dramatic and just fire them. they will give batohi headache if left in office "@Mzalwane Mzala In the view of many people : Ace Magashule @Cerebis Why were some of them campaigning for Ramaphosa? "@Mzalwane Mzala I just fear that this 'renewal' is a nice slogan 
2:46:04,2:48:08, @Mzalwane Mzala they turned on the Zuma endorsement and saw the writing on the wall??? @peter pott He cant fire them if the enquiry found that they are fit but he can buy them out like Kgalema did to Pikoli "my disappointment with president CR is that he never brought us a new face. only recycling.batohi was a prosecutor I agree @Mzalwane Mzala. If the recommendation was to keep them CR wouldn't really need the two's thoughts Why doesn't the Commission give a raised chair for the evidence leader. Standing for the whole day is like they are punishing the evidence leader.... @Pheladi Lamola My point exactly Amen...it's the only commission where the evidence leader stands the whole day! "@noah The venue is not accommodating 
2:48:09,2:52:37, The only person that openly supported CR17 is uncle Gwede Mantashe Gwede goes where the wind blows...he was an ardent Zuma supporter Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi have until Tuesday to make representations to President Cyril Ramaphosa in response to a report into their fitness to hold office in the (NPA). (News24) here we go ......üòé end game for Snake and SnailüòÅ @Eslon Eslon That on its own reduces @Cerebis' 4 "@eddie zondi Since we are left to speculate. I would assume perhaps judge Mokgoro decide to leave option dismissal solely for the president to do or apply his mind independently 
2:52:53,2:56:49, "Robert must be accountable for the office he occupied as the head of IPID by then Nope it does not....I agree with Magda on hashtag Mantashe "People like him are playing more political games I give up @Cerebis . Some of us were not watching from a distance bu were involved in the campaigns. do not let him out he wasted our time "common sense must just prevail. the is a new sheriff in town. both jiba and mrwebi cannot work with this sheriff. ie Jiba relegates willie to backbenches Makgoro report will only be released after Ramaphosa let us know whether Jiba and Mrwebi is staying/going Mc Bride was interviewed but obviously IPID being founded on confidentiality he could not shout it to the world...most of the people who came forward didn't make a noise If they made a noise it would have given fuel to fire to vilify them more
