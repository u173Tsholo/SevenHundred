Like watching paint dry. This witness. Why has EFF not picked on BOSASA before State Capture revelations? the chair allocated 15 minutes for this witness...nearly an hour and heard nothing of substance from a 17 page report 
1:14:50,1:15:54, @nichol shange Watson played with peanuts . The Guptas went for hook line and sinker @Moira T Your DA got 44 votes because eff was apart of anc and racking in the money. anyone following the architect is saying @welton paulse she is an architect who wants to help the commission on the layouts of the gupta residences which mentor was giving evidence on.. also have you noticed cash in transet heist slowed down once the anc guy was caught. i think all the heists were the anc for bossasa to pay them @Briony French Malema and the water project in the North worth 100 million and nothing build .... bossasa had access to full security gear Most of the youth in those areas have left bcos of unemployment and ANC will collect old pensioners to come and vote 4 them. wait 8th May is coming
