21:04,23:16, by now I would have paid back R100million @zip😍😍😍😍 SA should change tender process and do proper due diligence cyril doesnt want arrests. he loves corruption thats why we have this talk shop raise the price and sub contract. Easy peasy they all do it """ TENDERS R AN ' UNBILICAL CORD' 4 CORRUPTION""" But he testified earlier they did not have expertise to do the job so he ew they were going to sub contract

Richmond Virginia Richmond 🎥 Cyril was a disaster as Deputy Pres. He was appointed to look after Eskom. What did he do ? Show me one portfolio where he added value. You will search forever. "@ Lekgothoane Lesetja I know that the old man never be honest in the first place he enjoys his party majority to defend him in parliament when he faces tough question As much as the power is given to Mr president h shouldn’t be the only one responsible for misuse of funds.

"@Zip reeper no you are having wrong coz it is public how they fundraise money but Zuma faction doesn’t want to be investigated how they found money too this man is lying... I suggest they stop this tenders as most politicians are very rich because of them. Now being a politician is not about serving but quick wealth All these bald headed skelms 
38:57,40:58, Donald TRUMP has the same IQ as Jacob ZUMA All I can say is that Marikana is an unsolved crime of 34 black lives that still don't matter. A real crime against humanity. BLM??? 8 years later ANC?? Wonder if Edwin Sodi is another ANC voting socialist? Being a politician is about serving politicians. Like I said 🤣 why do this politicians get tenders in the first place.. Lying @Ndumieh Mokoena because they have access to tax money. dead men tell no stories

The only way to get rid of corruption is to embrace a free market where people who are incompetent are allowed to fail. what also annoys me about South Africa is that the public protector is very useless.... Problem is corruption has become too powerful. @Dominic its working in other economies SAA is a classic example. This government is spending billions on a failure which will continue to fail.
