14:37,16:52, studio time still allows us to finish this recording azishe Grizzi "thando cezula I'd buy Agrizzi's album over Zuma's anytime... The state capture inquiry reveals that corruption is more about money than race. The urge to make corruption a 'black' trait has always been untoward. guys is me Nkosinathi This man can sing... Konje why are Bosasa offices still not raided? "Thando WHERE ARE THE EFF IDIOTS TODAY? 
16:58,23:18, @Phahamang Thakudi They are waiting until the perpetrators are on a plane and then they will issue a warrant of arrest Phahamang they're busy shredding evidence by the bucket loads! is sing corruption is white man. thing divide and rule "And the Hawks will only make a show of the raid later in the year the anc?? How hypocrtical are the Watson brothers....aaaarrrgggghhhhh may i please have R486 million to start my farming project @Julian Martinez So the corrupt officials who took money are innocent victims of Freemasons? 
23:25,26:05, I think people would more forgiving to a party that steals 10% and give 90% to the people and not this vice versa that the ANC is doing but hey ANC stays winning kunjalo ü§î Not that they should be stealing to begin with The Freemasons use corrupt law enforcement as an armoured car to secure the arrival and distribution of incoming shipments of illegal drugs/narcotics. @Phahamang Thakudi What do you think will happen to you if you steal 10% of income from your employer? As i said - Not that they should be stealing to begin with company will shut down @Phahamang Thakudi Just illustrating how far our moral compass have shifted. We are grateful if they only steal a little. @Phahamang Thakudi Only in South Africa. You get hijacked and then praise the Lord they didn't shoot your 2 year old on the back seat 
26:06,31:47, "With all of this happening  no need to steal even one cent @Julian Martinez We need accountability in this country - BY INDIVIDUALS. People have the freedom of choice. They choose to be criminal or not @Houws Houlinou in an ideal country (world) it shouldnt be like that but here we are. What else can we do actually we should thank the watsons as this saga should put the ANC out of power surely the people can't vote for thia lot @Phahamang Thakudi Not let the governing party get the majority vote. Let the opposition be the majority to serve the interest of the citizens "@Kevin Davis you will be surprised @Houws Houlinou ideally that's what I would like see as well - what do they call it? coalition? thakudi are u trying to say I am from.the UK that the south African citizens will vote for corruption 
32:27,34:42, @Phahamang Thakudi No matter who wins the election. The opposition should have the power to hold the governing party to account if they don't serve South Africa's interests. Let's wait for the Commission to take its own course and not crucify ANC because of a few rotten potatoes. in the UK Theresa will be forced out on Brexit alone far less than the rot here @Phahamang Thakudi The ANC had the majority vote. That is why they could just cover up corruption without fear. They just steamrolled everyone jail term for those who are busy stealing our money must be increase.from 15 years to atleast 75 year. "ANC is a rural party and unfortunately it plays on emotional blackmail on our fathers I agree with jail term for the thieves I think next a ACSA airport company South African.Bosasa was there for more than 20 years there on security industry @Titi Pitso Unfortunately it's not the few.Zuma once said No-one is clean in the ANC. 
35:20,41:36, @Kevin.....My friend...sorry to say but......This Is Africa.....the ANC are seen as Saviors...no matter what... jaw dropping evidence @MIKE LOCK They saved themselves alright Shame......commie policy is ok with the ANC.. I wonder what informs Agrizzi's decision to testify The ANC from what I can see are no different than our situation here in The Bahamas. political index and not economic INDEPENDENCE for BAHAMIANS. The COLONIAL status quo is still in CONTROL Agrizzi mentioning himself too.now is not eazy to c his motives. the Bahamas are controlled by the Clintons "Please search for ""The 1994 South African elections"" a perspective by Phyllis Jordan. You will understand why we are where we are with the ANC" 
42:36,47:11, i have 5 kids.one dont like school the other four do attend school.must we paint them with same brush?? "this is the world we leave in you can only be liable to what happens to your life anything after it is outside your hands. Stealing has nothing to do with race but greediness agree @Mxolisi......Spot on Bra... are we gonna c steinhorf commision??pic billions stolen.interesting?? """The 1994 South African elections"" a perspective by Phyllis Jordan. It's a letter written by A.C Jordan's wife "This should widely open our eyes on who to vote for 
47:17,53:48, @Michael....they too must be charged etc.... we will make sure we give them last chance @Michael Michael lets hope the PIC inquiry will get to that too ANC will always loot money by the vehicle called tenders or Ratanang Trust or Zuma foundation that is how politicians steal money of tax pay! @Tlou Chris So true and they are not willing to deliver us from poverty. The ANC is arrogant. "Let's give ANC another chance "no it`s all of the anc 1.3 million chief of staff.that party with clean hands.mayor not aware of that.i want to be a premier. @Titi Pitso üòÇüòÇüòÇüòè 
54:16,56:30, @Titi.......sorry friend.......the ANC suppoted Gupta's and Co...... @Titi Pitso These individuals should long have been prosecuted. It all happened under everybody's watch in the ANC. Therefore....ANC corrupt etc... "When you add up Bossasa  "politicians will never care about the poor people It's painful. "every political party has people of influence behind ANC is open for business. All corrupt capitalist investors must pay Luthuli House a visit I can tell you now no party in SA is worth our votes but unfortunately we can't all stay home and not vote. Ideal election outcome is to not have any party with majority vote. 
56:30,1:01:05, "break the game  They must all govern hand-to-hand maybe just maybe that way they will be able to guard each other I do understand your pain which is mine as well and but we need to give Cyril a chance. Betrayal of the trust and loyalty. For more than 20 years. Too much. "cyril has been part of this since day 1 AGRIZZI IS LIAR "Its too early to be judgmental at this stage @Blaze 613 Everything happened under Cyril's watch as a dep. President of the country. He had all the necessary powers to blow a whistle. Guys......just remember this......Cyril and co....are all cut from the same ANC cloth.......don't trust them too much i'm afraid...

1:09:07,1:12:13, Imagine what will be revealed when the corruption that has allegedly occurred at Eskom is finally exposed "@Nqobile Ncube It can lay the basis of one being investigated and prosecuted by law. If actions are unconstitutional unearthing the filth of corruption should be a component of justice @Nqobile Ncube no jiba coverage??

EEF is no better than any other party. Only difference is that only the narrow minded believe them "Agrizzi should be our future President  Same as pres cyril "i might just snap There is much much more but I suppose those who so fervently support him will find out to their detriment.He wants South Africa to be the next Venezuela

All the man is saying opportunity for all William give us one thing that he don't want that will help sa 
1:22:15,1:23:15, mamphela i actually like mamela. he has leadership qualities Where is he sleeping???

Vote Dagga Party üòÇü§£ is Malema going to Honourable Zondo.? "Agrizzi....is exhausted mani You elect hyenas to look after sheeps and get surprised when sheeps go missing but i cant trust him. only reason EFF exist is because he got fired by ANC not because he wanted to change the country for the poor 
1:23:52,1:25:09, @Lelo you are right we just need the pressure from EFF but never to be put into power "if Malema possess so much information It is time to try eff people Malema .cannot have a intelligent debate without insulting people.

"he said :when you lefT guys just shut up and listen please how Lebo DA will take over...... 
1:25:59,1:27:05, Politicians are not known for emotional intelligence...its mostly about power.Only a few have the interests of the people at heart. Malema made it clear that South Africa will not be nice without whites and so how can he hate them at anc those are thier parenns who make them who they are tody "Malema and his cahoots in the EFF are just angry that they were born after the struggle was over. Hence #coughs# the land issue is putting white people in june july We are multitasking...and I will never be told to shut up.This is a public forum. "If you are white and happy with the stealing them support anc Take Malema serious at your own risk
