21:14,25:05, tell the truth one time don't hang yourself sir @Nyamade Vhutshilo ​state capture steals from the lives of poor blacks. Zuma is a fighter you must fall into prison dearest telecommunication minister theres interference with your inferstructer bad reception for the past week Ace his a gangster what his your boss please deal with it a.s.a.p "@Keith Sindile Dinabantu @Phillip Cwazibe it is very frustrating So Zonda agrees the country was under state capture 
25:35,29:00, waiting to the end is too long away. with information like this action should be taken on people. Thats easy to answer Zonda It’s Zondo not Zonda Sorry my A is an O Because....CJ.....the ANC reckon they can do No Wrong..... no matter where you are Say it like it is...CJ... Cause...CJ...the whole of the ANC is corrupt...... Eish sekgowa se sebothata 
29:02,34:01, Corrupt to the core. Trust non of them CJ...... throw the 1st Low Level Munipal employee in jail for 20yeras then see the dominoes fall upwards Cause their Small Little Minds just Cannot handle it....

Go for the small fry 1st... watch em squirm. Minimum sentences of 20/25 years each for stealing from the poor 
34:02,36:16, This is a fact...... Have no fear You sounds like you working with them M.L @Ben Cole .......They don't know what shame is...... "Electoral Systems is working fine "Intimidation and ridicule used in parliament to shut the opposition up all the time @R hunter A few executions for corruption might have the desired effect. Ramaphosa is innocence I think the money left was going to be used to paid for widows and victims of Marikana coz that was affecting him personally Free State is worse 
36:31,39:03, You mean you can put the evidence on a table? MIKE LOCK EFF knows WOW! From Zondo. Just put the ruling party on trial. Start with the vote of no confidence in JZ.!!!!!! "now ZONDO is talking @Nkosinathi Makhaye ......Come on Bra........can't you see so far what has been happening..............think about it Bra.. this is unfair where is adv maleka @Nkosinathi Makhaye ....Bra...so you reckon nothing has happend with All this..... @Sebation Nantsika ​Free State is worse and sadly so with all its potential. People continue appointing looters through their votes. How is the unfair @Phillip Cwazibe 
39:06,40:57, At the end of the day his recall was nothing more than a non parliamentary vote of no confidence. worse then an idiot is an idiot with a bias this man is a empty vessel who make noise @cwazibe free state is where the state capture started REALLY @fuzile dazana Soinds like you're talking about the typical ANC supporter. Adv Maleka is black and under looked by this commission but Adv Skhakhane will sort out Fuzile. you have better evediance "Fura 
40:59,44:22, @ DJ DJ ​How is the unfair @Phillip Cwazibe I do not understand the question. You didn’t listen to mbalula even the current premier reporting to the previous premier "As much as this commission seeks the truth update me on this Isidingo episode eeeesh...Days of our Corrupted lives........heheh @Sorry was ment at @fuzile dazana for "When you say they where aware Ace Magashule once again coming out as well as Zwane surely these guy must be in jail 
45:09,47:04, "@Sibangani Dube Ace isn't going down @Sibangani Dube Their turn is coming. They can't run forever. @mr BOSHIELO . Yes he did ask. I can tell you the answer. He was still breathing that skelm. @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU It seems like none of the PP reports can be trusted. "@mr BOSHIELO LOL. You correct "only thing can save our country "@Keith "@Derek Main Hm 2.6 million gate the PP didn’t get that? 
47:16,48:58, "Never trusted her anyway @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Me neither. But her day is fast approaching too. Should ti be ask who owned Estina Company... @ Keith S Dinabantu this woman must go it is second time now proven wrong "So the PP HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE LIED intentionally (falsehood) "@Mthuthuzeli Ntlanyana Jeez @ I am Free. I remember the first Sahara computers that we got.... Was the biggest crap we ever bought!! "ace magashule ke skelm tronk toe  Let's not call other people empty vessels. 
49:15,51:03, "@Derek Main yOU think so? Like Zuma this man is wasting our data "It looks to me Free State and North west dnt forget mahumapelo "Sorry @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU . Fully agree with you. I remember that clearly. Should never have been appointed. Also the SSA conotations should not have been ignored @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU It's largely irrelevant what she thinks of her conduct. What's more important is what the MPs and judges think - they hold her future in their hands. Sahara was built of old tec parts from China India etc. "@makhosi nobhatyi But like Zuma 
51:54,54:03, "@Pastor J I was shocked when she was praised by Malema and Shivambu as a ""black child that deserves the job."" LOL" Now the PP has to pay for court fees out of her own pocket because she has been found to have lied to the courts. Now that is serious! "@Pastor J Should never have been appointed @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Talk about a kiss of death. LOL "@ Keith S Dinabantu I don’t think they respect courts decision @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU . The EFF got a kick in the teeth. If I recall clearly they were the only party that actually opposed her appointment. Stand to be corrected Form a circle ⭕️ that the PP can’t see into 🙈 @Pastor J The DA vehemently opposed the PP selection. 
54:16,56:06, @makhosi nobhatyi yOU reckon or think she must do the right thing and resign? "People are using Media articles as evidence @Pastor J you are correct EFF did oppose her appointment No she must not resign @Pastor J The EFF (after some debate) decided that she should be given a chance. "@Pastor J They were not happy on her answers on Zuma and high profile cases "Mail guardians We need to her to tell the country who influenced her reports People of South Africa this commission is there for us as members of public and the commission is still doing its job as was designed so let us wait for commission to finish it's cause so we can talk 
56:07,57:27, "@Derek Main Correct Damaking Alie He only used the article to show that the dots are linked. "@Derek Main You are correct I think the judiciary is scathing on dangerous territory. We could have another Adv. Nomcebo Jiba case pending. This judgement suggests she does not have integrity to be at the Bar of advocates!! Hello everyone. How are you here tonight? "But should they come up with new evidence Cool livestream "@Sthakathi Khumalo If that's what's necessary to get rid of her Sthakathi Khumalo.. Taking it to its logical conclusion. YES. 
57:33,59:17, @Pastor J EFF wanted her as PP hence the vote "@Derek Main She wasn't even in my top 3 of the best candidate! Although i was impressed with her qualifications on the table @Elon Musk uthini? Elon Musk is here?? @Mrs Anderson @ Keith S Dinabantu yes she must just resign b4 being charged with criminality of wrongdoing in law "😀 😀 😀 molo bhuti @Derek Main incompetent she may be but from where i stand she is purely serving her handlers' interests Don’t bore us wena Elon...😏 "@Derek Main Extremely incompetent. Remember @makhosi nobhatyi  
59:19,1:00:36, @Mrs Anderson Ndiyabulela kakhulu "makhosi Lol they seems followed my critic here on their messed up video or images presentation Advocate Gcabashe is absolutely brilliant Elon Mate........we need your Bucks to save RSA....... @Elon Musk When are you coming back and open a Tesla store? "Concerned South African & Derek Main interesting times @Sthakathi Khumalo Definitely interesting. It's gonna be a roller coaster. @ Keith S Dinabantu once she is found again in a wrong side of PG and president review surely she has to tell us who is working for 
1:00:37,1:01:58, can I have one of you electric cars...for Free.....heheh "@Elon Musk You won't know when anyway hi where is the pictures Manufacturing Tesla in RSA isn’t viable... petition the Govt. for better economic conditions Dats rite "@Mike Lock  @Keith S Dinabantu she is causing problems in law she seems not knowing what she is doing @Elon Musk Although we all know u are a fake profile I like your response 
1:02:00,1:02:57, @makhosi nobhatyi The courts now know her dodgy conducts. I foresee her losing 3 out of the her 5 remaining cases in court what conditions would you recommend "if all the money that was stolen used to build each family a house on at least 100m2 Elon Mate......contact Jacobo....he will help you for sure.....heheh Elon Musk is a businessman why would he put money in South Africa lol because he was born in SA Lol Ace Magashule really destroyed the Free State Province But his not stupid 
1:03:12,1:04:59, a true Son of the soil....... "@makhosi nobhatyi she knows exactly whats expected of her I love RSA. But my life has moved. My heart is in Africa "@makhosi nobhatyi Indeed all this money. and the government will say they dont have the money to build proper schools in rural areas If Elon saw that law was restored in SA and criminals send to jail then SA would become a great investment. The real world has given up on Africa with it’s Hands out for money 💰 💰 "@ Keith S Dinabantu remember when she took over she criticized Thuli Madonsela on her findings on Nkandla saga and state capture You hear any allegations then you jump 
1:05:15,1:06:40, has any arrest been made since the debut of SOC? ace magashule went to the school of the ama stealing poor peoples money and lie to the poor of givin jobs he must be a famaly member of zuma Africa has big problems. But not too big for it’s peoples to overcome. It’s up to the people to make change. Unite instead of divide. Not as yet @Elon Musk We all love SA but many of us hate what the politicians have done to it. They need to give the cows pink sugar power to make Pink Milkshakes 😊😊... Michael. あ @Danie Nilsen LOL. That school is the one that deserves to be burnt 
1:06:44,1:07:33, "Michael Wild  All these farms and companies they opened up to take our money need to be taken over by the government and run properly creating jobs and putting money into our country "Is that the real Elon Musk?🤔 I doubt @Dean marais Agree.... pregnant cows ...... i wonder if ace and zuna assisted in that job lot of cows to service ha Uhg Fake Elon Musk Cattle feeding shed for 7.2mil Zuma 
1:07:34,1:09:05, @T G Swartlane I doubt Elon would be here LOL if Elon could answer where the first headquarters of Tesla た 🙁 "@Dean marais That sentence doesn't really make sense. If the government takes it over 😂🤣🤣😂 yes Keith @Mrs Anderson yEAH lots of money but the PP said that case is not a big deal...but the 500 000 campaign money is a big deal! empty tanks @T G Swartlane Still fun to play along. 
1:09:06,1:10:14, "Even if I was the real Elon Tesla’s first HQ was in Pao Alto some people do not know this but i do the 4 farms of malema is that he diaorioiated his own farms with out compensation and gave it all away to his wife kwaaks They should give it to Operhiemers. and see how they fix it up and help the locals just like the airport next to OR Tambo. it's making profits "@Dean marais But there are many or plenty corrupt Hyenas in gov too  This inquiry is going nowhere it will be ditched because the ANC is corrupt not just a single person. Politics is like mind game. you observes and use what is in front of you to make people jump cause they always looking for something to jump for be careful south Africans "@Keith Sindile I don’t what the PP is on about because Political Parties are not mandated to declare donations or say where they come from Why would Elon care about this topic anyways... liar liar pants on fire 
1:10:31,1:11:57, I will be tweeting about the State Capture Inquiry in the coming hours. Wait for my Twitter. @Elon Musk Have you been following this commission? "@Mrs Anderson I thought so also what is in Zurich then Elon. @Derek main right now our country doesn’t have much of a choice it doesn’t have to be run directly by the government directly but letting other people run it isn’t helping us they just take it all I have been following it passively. I have a busy schedule 😂🤣😂 busy schedule sir Elon "@Derek Main When today I hear a white person say that these days @Dean marais It should be run by the supposed beneficiaries with help from mentors. 
1:11:59,1:13:00, This @Elon Musk is whack ELON 5 SUBSCRIBERS LOL? 😂😂😂 @Elon Musk ​I have been following it passively. I have a busy schedul "Elon Musk  "@Mrs Anderson Was worried that markets will turn their back on us Roy Jankielsohn is unshaven and should have been more presentable no it was not sience the were playin bull themselfs poor cows and they took showers after that I could imagine a train from CT to Joburg that takes less than 4 house. what that would do for tourists. and a link to Durban would just be wow Elon musk wants to now inplant artificial intelligence into humans brains. He should start with himself 
1:13:02,1:13:52, well done broe @Norman Zwane Sorry bud - I've said a lot of things here. Not sure which you are referring to. "Like I said to previous commenters Seems Ace Magashule's supporters are posting nonsense here Neuralink will change the world for the better @Derek main agree let’s hope they can rebuild these projects and do the right thing so we can start rebuilding cause it seems like things are going to get worse as this year ends PP causing so much chaos on political party campaign but we have millions squandered on dairy farms.... She exonerated the officials like Ace anyway.... 🥛🥛🥛PP is 🙈 and corrupt not seeing this as rape of SA. SA is a dream deferred 
1:13:54,1:15:34, Ouch Danie... But u can say that again 😊😊😂 When will the N2 be a coastal highway from George to Surf City Durban ace is going down I don't think they know what is oversight they over ate @Dean marais Agree - it's going to take a lot of fixing. The first thing is to get the ANC out. Bunch of crooks - corrupt to the core. Elon Mate...please help SA........show us the way....heheh "@clive oconnell No Well said Derek.. Thnx to much tenders to there boeties 
1:15:36,1:16:38, I wish that the dignity of the Astina Dairy beneficiaries is eventually restored before they depart for the next world... When will the N2 be a coastal highway from George to Surf City Durban - autobahn will be a tourism moneyspinner @Derek Main and replace them with who? A new bunch of crooks? RSA needs a new revolution. A compete overthrow. Otherwise it’s just a bandaid fix. i am synical because we could have been so much better as a nation if we had more serious and dedicated politicians on the flipside busness was in the curry pot as well I'M skeptical as to what will happen after this commission following what the pp found against the CR17 Mike Elon will loan a rocket to the ANC and send them to the Moon leaving only the young smart once and non corrupt once. Lets not make the same mistake we did with Nomcebo Jiba because this will come to haunt us!! @clive oconnell LOL... The PP just did this 🙈on wasted millions on dairy farms "Elon Musk 
1:16:49,1:18:13, who is next "@Elon Musk You're speaking my language. We RSA is dogged by its history of institutionalised racism. It’s still evident to this day. "Elon 🚀 If a reusable rocket ever landed in SA it would disappear as scrap overnight he is from Gansters paradise "It adjournment not tea time Ok thanks🤣🤣🤣 is very sad to hear all this 😤 
1:18:26,1:21:28, I must leave now. Be sure to follow my Twitter. I will make comment regarding this commission tomorrow morning. Elon. Tesla have cars. when we going to see large motorcycles. I suppose I might just find the Klippies and Coke a bit more interesting than the next witness. But lets wait and see. Problem with the proportional representation system in RSA is that for many deployees it is an economic lifeline. Some have taken it to an extreme in trying to annuity incomes. @Elon Musk Cool - thanks for the chat. Public protector must go to jail and pay every cent she obtained since the appointment Brilliant Advocate and witness. Well Done to both. @david cele . The baby in your profile pic is so beautiful and calm. What happened to you Bro? Someone dropped you on your head? @Concerned South African The real problem with proportional representation is that there is no accountability to the voters. 
1:21:46,1:22:53, SS S S SS @Pastor J 😁 All the political parties are corrupt we just need to find the ones who are will to take there small share give the rest to the country as it’s suppose to be so we can see our country grow @Derek Main ..game ...heheha Numbers ..It's @david cele @Derek Main . Its okay Davide. We forgive you and we love you despite that EFF nonsense If EFF is the solution they must stop smuggling cigarettes 
1:23:21,1:25:23, Derek Main : Yes as it puts the representatives' economic interests ahead of accountability. the EFF is the solution for what plz explain @Derek Main ......Ooops...it's a numbers game mate.....heheh "Is Dean Marais Oh noooooooooo.

2:42:54,2:43:57, @Nduduzo maybe all future presidents should not be from a particular political party... I watched the commission when Judge Zondo was being interviewed for the position of Deputy Chief Justice. I have even more respect for him - if that's possible. Derek i like that @Michael Wild ....100&10% agree with you 👍👍 wild you a fake ne hahaha @Michael Wild I think it's most SAfns dream - except the politicians - it serves their own interests to stoke racial divides. "Michael Wild ​ you also engaging other talks lol 
2:44:01,2:45:45, south africa is and was always in unity it is only a few radicals who screws up all they touch Agree Derek @Michael What time did you take your meds❓ why dont we exchange numbers ppz? 95% of all people just want to get along and do the best they can for their families. The other 5% cause the problems and are unfortunately the loudest (and have agendas) "now it is tribal and factions the zullu  Let's exchange numbers and have a party 😄 @Martin De Beer True that. white narrative is a unifyng force
