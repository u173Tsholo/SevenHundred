34:59,38:51, Gauteng joburg lol all this research and the cows died because off hunger ? well i don't think they do gluten free cat food "...Goofy daft religions are failed mental states to separate people as cattle without selfworth. No one is born in herds "SA has huge dairy farms and factories for products thereof "This guy is defending magashule yes zondo my man He googled research 😂😂😂 they should blame the milk for this

1:36:27,1:37:06, "If you try to protect politicians you won't succeed in this commission. Koloane had the same approach and demeanor he will say he didn't know Narayana... wait for it I don’t think he came with his lawyers @ Thami Nobela @Christy they are there with him legal representatives are there...i guess they cant help at this point. Wow - there you go. Eish must please explain! 👀 his poephol is going like this (o)...(O)...(o)...(O) with every question In ALL MY TRAVELS OVERSEAS 😀 😀 😀 How much tax mali did this imbecile waste?????

The tax fairies will pay for everything. 
1:42:10,1:42:52, Kunzima bafowethu. why is not easy? Totally disagree with you @ I its not easy to say no to a free holiday @Dumza Maswana he must stop his lying mara With such obedient civil servants all we need is upstanding honest leadership. In the wrong hands the consequences are State Capture...... SA tax fairies are taxed to the limit I'm interested in what makes it not easy to ask questions... Zondo kill them 
1:42:54,1:43:47, lol It's not easy to ask questions when you have no idea what questions to ask. any ladies on this platform?🤗 lol...Lying lol he's sticking with his protocol line it may not be easy but what about accountability?

1:45:41,1:46:26, """Mic chairman"" 🤣🤣 @Thabo Mzamani Looks like it Done Totally disagree with you @ I Am Free: enquiry is state your statement (what you have known till to date) and cross-examination is to test your statement is right or wrong Hello I AM FREE She is an excellent advocate Zondo is on fire here. Answer sir Tjooo He probably wont pitch tomorrow @ Brennan 
1:46:32,1:47:22, Chair its 4 o'clock haha Head of department .... wow the degree of incompetence zondo tells him how to do his job? "They won't question this is why the farm doors are closed! He must ask for recess I don't have an answer 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ANC governance personified certified incompetency 
1:47:22,1:48:38, "now AWL demand Bathabile to go back to gov I dont have an answer hahahahaaaaaaa.we are misled "This guy is with holding some information  "I am From Zimbabwe It does not sound right Mr Thabethe? i object chair ! he needs to answer the question. lol Value add?

Outside employee being payed by department 😳😳😳 Adv Gcabashe doesn't wanna let go This guy is shamefully corrupt. I am sad to see this. Eish Thabethe taking a bullet for everyone can the commission adjourn for today Me. Thabethe needs to go rest LOL 
1:49:34,1:51:12, @makhosi nobhatyi Probably not even an employee of anyone. "...There is such a thing as an educated fool they got him finally 🙄 @I Am Free JIP 100% correct "Then if it’s like that @ I Am Free: if the person said he can’t comment or don’t know Somebody need to give Thabete a cold glass of milk for his troubles @ Lee you can say that again """Protocol officer"" is there to make sure the official doesn't ask questions which will expose the scam." The only way to stop the cronies from taking a bullet for the team is for the NPA to start acting on the evidence presented here at the commission. These people know that nothing is going to hpn 2 thm 
1:51:40,1:53:21, @ Dominic Przybylski that is true this is blocking the Bullet now protect those whom seniors @Cerebis he is very ashamed hence I said he shouldn't go home after this. he deserves ice cold water.

1:56:46,1:57:28, protocol my foot!!! Strategic partner = people who pay the bribes. Thabete's strategy data has been depleted @Buyiswa Mnyani 😂😂😂😂 I think he should have a fake heart attack to get out now....he is in deep trouble 😂😂all positions Mal-Enema and Zuma want to keep our current PP in office........ to keep them out of jail.... the NPA is next to be attacked. @Mbuso Ndlovu what do you plan to loot? The kind of questioning here by AdvQcabashe put to Mr Thabethe is for Court purposes nt for enquiry:they must apply for Cross-Examinations cause people will not want to come here 2 tell their stories 
1:57:36,1:58:11, the numbers 😂 Fake heart attack.......LOL the numbers @Robert Russell they are not winning this time and they signed it the letters he and zuma sat next to each other in mathematics class how? Wow! Incompetence at its worst😂😂😂 
1:58:18,1:58:51, big difference between million and billion lol "this commission is useless anyway just like the rest Lololol @makhosi nobhatyi I understand... I believe most people would like to see atleast 1 prosecution arising from this Commission. But yep...will wait for another 2-3 years for that to happen Next week we do the alphabet @Cerebis 😂😂😂 million again Deputy Chief Justice 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 
1:58:56,1:59:39, R100 000 000.00 =R1 Million im for fake heart attack to save him 1000 million rand just count the zeros no Norman 🤣 I want Thabete to give bonuses some day coz he will be very generous hahahaaaaaaaa....another zuma on figures..1thousand million.........what is the million rand doing there😂😂😂😂 This guy is very disappointing he could not even write R1000000 lol 
1:59:43,2:00:35, @Thami Nobela not this time around 😂😂😂😂😂 His head is shining but he is not very bright easy to use money that comes freely Judge Zondo 😂😂😂😂 zondo cant help himself😂😂 He should object to being cross examined and walk out It was R837 000 written as R837 Million. What is a Million doing there? so much education and you can't count difference millions and thousands..mmm 
2:00:42,2:01:48, I find that amazing.... that there was budget that had not been stolen by then an old man making a fool of himself “I pass chair” 🤣🤣🤣 Do a Zuma and walk........ they get so much money they can't even count it HOD mmmmmmm He should do the Leeu loop? "@I Am Free 1000 million does not equate to 1 trillion Or forget everything including his name.... 
2:01:52,2:02:56, yooo cne this guy is also in on it. Zuma is our Lord here Kwazulu He wanted additional money Ha!!!!!!! mayne guptas wanted 30000 instead of 30 million maybe @Wesley Myburgh its an open secret woow wowo

2:04:03,2:05:12, I don't think this gut even knows that hes a thief I'm not that guy no. the money improves you to deliver the service 😂😂😂 doesn't make sense "eish this was a poor day for my homie why did the cows not get service? They get told prior to coming to the Commission what questions they will be asked . The evidence leader is reading from the file compiled during interview Nonsense imagine your child and mine wishing to have FILA shoes and nice phone like thiz pips kids. and we bang our heads and feel like lozers like we didn't go to school like thiz pipls. I'm hurt 
2:05:18,2:06:39, A sad story indeed Today its interesting Zondo forgot about time @Lourens De Jager that's a very important question 🤣🤣 Thami please throw towel for your homeboy... "If the ""people"" allow it look at what can be done by government 😀" Myburgh author I was not sure about it but with loopholes here it may make sense they attack him to discredit the book whereas the book speaks the problem allocations "The cows were corrupt 😂😂 
2:06:53,2:08:03, i agree Abel Ace's Gangster State in real life guys. "mxm chair it's already 4pm He's got a Diploma in Corruption Mbuso 🤣🤣🤣 A degree Get the money to me chair I think he's got Masters in Corruption initiation hases??? Huh? Circumcision?
