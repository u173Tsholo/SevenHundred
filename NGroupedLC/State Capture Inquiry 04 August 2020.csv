Even people finishing bachelor degrees are immediately looking for jobs over seas 
44:18,47:33, Big trouble coming 600 homeless white educated british nationals have been dying on the streets per year for the last 5 years. Large companies in UK have been doing all recruitment in India and Srilanka and Pakistan This country is going to the dogs Buyani Mlongo what I mean is unemployed people in the UK get assistance from the government unlike South Africa Blame Starvation on Apartheid even though there was food security back then. @Craven Morehead before the virus on average 55 families were arriving in AUS.

The hospitals r filling in the gaps with their slow LETHAL INJECTIONS... oops I mean testng AFRICA IS FALLING!!! üî• @L LI I agree the reasons for homelessness are based on individuals and their life choices. The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that the myth that poverty only effects black people in SA is not true

58:13,58:55, Remember you can't compare SA with any first world country. The UK has nearly as many taxpayers as south Africa's unofficial unemployment figures Naledi yes I agree with you.

Can you imagine if Kate H appears on the scene tomorrow at 5PM.. @Craven pls don't say poverty is a myth dan. for your info things were better during ace tenure.

It is a lesson for all of us @@Ayanda Sokhela It is a waste of time and money since everyday certain amount of thousands is spent. @Mncedisi Mthethwa you are speaking the truth here. Great mind. when the witness is expected to take the hot seat? When will they be putting someone in the HOT Seat If EFF has a problem with Mashaba dealing with illegal foreigners then EFF can also go and try their nonsense somewhere else. I promise you now we will not let EFF govern. We will fight baba 
2:10:49,2:12:16, I miss Judge Makhubele üôÅ Aaaaaaaaace! Aaaaaaaaaace! Who must govern? Will they ever bring Ace to this commission? @Onke...Why? what happened? Did she die? He has been mentioned many times Mashaba must govern Magashule will come Why Mashaba? 
2:12:17,2:14:04, Or anyone other than the EFF basically. It‚Äôs a democratic country @Thami Ngwenya that is a very difficult question. All we have now is corrupt individuals waiting for that state purse "we use schools to plant food for our community "We all die "Mashaba has proven he is capable of governing when he was mayor of joburg and he is speaking on real issues. Illegal foreigners Apologies for spelling. I meant 'alive'. why ace is so quiete EFF will govern "funny enough 
2:14:14,2:16:52, "Mashaba alone wont solve our issues @Naledi Barron and what about our children. Lol I always laugh when EFF says the state must own all land. Like the traditional leaders will let that happen.... lol there will be war. Don‚Äôt be immature eff ohh COVID corruption is the worst ever criminal offences HOW IS IT THAT THE ANC THINKS ITS ACCEPTABLE FOR FAMILY TO DO BUSINESS WITH GOV Tenders must be nullified..no more tenders .. "@Craven Morehead. Our children will handle things corrupt Anc.let's go back to Nationa party @Naledi Barron how will we leave or children land when the state owns it all? What if I build on this land and then my lease ends and they take it with what I‚Äôve built? It‚Äôs not gonna happen. 
2:16:55,2:19:01, Only 2 problems of our country is 1.ANC 2.ANC voters "Dada We want the land others will follow national party was the same..difference being that they did not expose themselves How can u agree that people must have 5years experience knowing very well that they dnt have it but whites bcs they are owners of businesses their children are not asked for experience "I am always shocked by what these politicians do when they are exposed by investigating journalists that expose their corrupt behavior Facts. It‚Äôs not even a question there will be war if EFF tries to take land. You think the Zulu kingdom is just gonna give malema all their land? Don‚Äôt be Dom "Why all this long discussion about money being ""given"" to various individual? The money must have been transferred into a bank account. (It's not beyond imagination that these blokes used suitcases)." "David 
2:19:14,2:21:00, Brown envelope rules in South Africa it‚Äôs a fact. In government and private business. Brown envelopes full with money are flying around if it wasn't for the investigative journalists then all the corrupt politicians would get away with their corrupt behavior.....shocking to the point the Eff is not taking land wena its giving it to its original owners Carrying on- and somebody must have authorised it's withdrawal. Why this mystery? @Craven Morehead. I hear you. But it is useless to get sentimental over land. Leave your children money. Black first Land first is coming The fact is the money is gone. This is taking so long that the looters have had enough time to hide their money yes indeed those brown envelopes.....it goes to show @Naledi Barron I will get sentimental about what I want to. Especially if you spend your whole life putting everything into a piece of land. Then EFF comes and just takes it??? I would rather fight 
2:21:45,2:23:43, @plus 194 So did it in Zim and now its all Moer toe looters could have long been to where they belong.jail.Ramaphosa Is also involved the EFF is now fighting Zim became they paid white farmers compensation. as prove that expropriation does not work then civil war is coming @Naledi Barron you're missing the point... land can be more important than money... if the government owns the land they have the right to do as they wish with what you build over it... the gov does not have to own the land to decide what you do with land @sifiso ngubeni and then there will be even less left of SA Maserati + asbestos roof Range Rover + asbestos roof ü§£üòÇ If government owns land they can do what they want with that land and they can do whatever they want with YOU. Wake up. Grow up 
2:24:02,2:26:18, Nothing is for free. We all have to work someday no rightful owners will be left and guess what all this corruption under the nose of Cyril Ramaphosa our President....most notably his spokesperson and her husband and our Gauteng Health MEC....fire them and lay criminal charges Why should gov even tell us what to do with our own property? Hot Seat Time? it's our tax money they are stealing.....rotten to the core EFF was created and is being paid by China to destabilize South Africa @Craven because ANC is communistic... It‚Äôs obvious. Sorry I can‚Äôt tag you with those symbols haha 
2:26:43,2:29:12, @Craven no problem man... refer to me as @Unknown @Craven Morehead Copy paste üòÇ STILL LOOTING I C Okay no problem @Unknown "@Ê≤íÊúâ‰∫∫. I hear you. I get your point yes indeed nothing helps much....politics are for known crooks and crooked business people.....tenderpreneurs @Stronger together yes we all have to the right to life and to determine what we do with our life. I will not bow down to any government that wants to take my stuff. Even traditional leaders agree on On this. The earth was given to the people not governments and greedy criminals like EFF I think capitalism is more dangerous than communism. I grew under capitalism and i have only seen discrimination and the gap between poor and rich widening uncontrolled private sector price fixing 
2:29:30,2:31:02, SA is like the medieval times CR is King ANC cadres the Lords and Ladies and the rest phesants. "If you think about it guys... if there was no government and we had community leaders instead our problems would be much less. Central control is a joke Can provide for 60 million people effectively ? It‚Äôs a pipe dream Government causes half of our problems Shaka Zulu "@Naledi Barron Yes the entire world is in trouble in some way at the moment "unfortunately the government runs the show.....namely the courts.....the police....the prisons etc no the Eff won't be corrpt capitalism does not breed greed. it is people who are greedy in any economic distribution system 
2:31:14,2:32:06, @Melusi Sikakane communism has killed way way way more people in history than capitalism. Why do people constantly leave socialist and communist countries for capitalist countries? Craven do you understand the purpose of central government? whistle-blowers aren't even protected anywhere.... @Melusi both have flaws but communism takes away your freedom of private property... "@Pienaar van Wyk . Those who do not learn from history SADC big wigs will never be ruled by a civilian government...look at Zimbabwe sifiso ngubeni are you sure about that sifiso? "Watching Zondo corruption @sifiso Maharaj EFF is already corrupt hahahaha what about VBS? On point engineering? Your beloved EFF is controlled by forces in China and London... liberate your mind bro 
2:32:24,2:33:50, South Africa isn't a communist country....we area democracy....freedom of speech Yes we are a democracy and we have the right to voice our opinion in public EFF wouldn‚Äôt allow that who is sifiso Maharaj? So how will that work? Lol at least Eff will give black people jobs Some communist shill SO LOOTING IS THE NEW NORM "At this stage 
2:34:10,2:35:15, Shaking my head lol @sifiso...hat jobs and where will the jobs come from? @sifiso EFF will be the worst African dictators in existence sifiso there has to be jobs first. giv is not designed to create. they can only spend Some judges are corrupt but to be honest South Africa has one of the best judicial systems in the world. Very free and fair like it should be @sifiso ngubeni Are you sure about this ? How will EFF give people jobs? Doing what? "Malema will be in prison by the time elections come. Julius = EFF van wyk ngathi u think you clever 
2:35:27,2:36:16, Yes gov cannot create jobs EFF still needs to explain VBS Most people place uncontrolled in power will become corrupt strong laws and double checks with big consequences is the only answer GOVERNMENT HAS NO JOBS OR CREATE ANY JOBS wat is the anc doing about jobs? "@sifiso ngubeni  @sifiso ngubeni what if we are clever? "yes us whitey's don't have much hope here anymore....we are always short changed....jobs "truth be told @Sifiso... EFF is also incredibly devious... they try to appeal to blacks in poverty by promising them pies in the sky 
2:36:35,2:38:21, EFF is implicated "@Pienaar van Wyk . Don't be so quick to judge anyone's comments on the forum. I respect yours EFF blatantly lies to the poor. Selling them snake oil I trust in Mashaba "@sifiso ngubeni You got me there "ANC was bought by big pockets of capitalist system WMC We can disagree but still have respect for one another. Does EFF show respect to those who disagree with them? who's d witness fellow South Africans "Corruption is an apartheid legacy 
2:38:23,2:39:47, @Ê≤íÊúâ‰∫∫ What does you name say ? the seat of global power has now moved from London to Dubai @Melusi Sikakane give me an example of WMC? You still believing the lies bell Pottinger told us? Sorry just curious. "@Sam Monkoe... it says ""No One"" no worries friend" lol thanks man. WMC = IMF loan from Washington in the US. Hypocritical not??? üëçüòä So they spent all that money to remove asbestos but it‚Äôs still there? Typical ANC looting 
2:40:02,2:42:37, we will not vote for crooks @Craig Johnson IMF is not from Washington... secondly we received IMF COVID relief. Also would it be better that our economy collapses instead of IMF helping? "@Stronger Together are you referring to the ""new world order""?" "apartheid was bad yes agreed @Craven Morehead all supermarkets all mining gurus all farmers 2000 or 3000 white farmers supplying food for 60m people etc "yes corruption during apartheid van wyk I think there's something that u know @Stronger Together so basically Luciferians are taking over the world? @Garth Andre and the home electrical invoices were received and were accurate. 
2:43:41,2:47:30, well spotted Naledi @Garth Andre apardheid did me no favours but all the ANC had to was take over a gov. that worked expand it to ALL the people. But the ANC became a criminal enterprise witness the Zondo commission. I never supported apartheid but jobs were many and crime wasn't so bad as it is now....and government coffers are now been siphoned by corrupt people instead of honesty and ethics by officials we vote Look at loving life they want to.start new politcal pary Respect @Sanjay Maharaj . What's going on with this stream? @Pienaar van Wyk Could you please send a link i havent seen that in msm yet. hold the phone! asbestos use was outlawed in the 90's "apartheid happened more than 26 years ago 
2:47:35,2:49:56, Yes @Sanjay Maharaj you are seeing this @samüò¨üò¨ And some of these asbestos houses are still standing in the free state so much for BLM Even though they paid to remove them Craven Morehead In Durban also TEHEHEHEHEHEHE @Sam Monkoe Let me first clarify that the formative stages of children which is below 10 years give them the fundumental beliefs with which they will live the rest of their lives. "@Sanjay Maharaj. Well spotted
