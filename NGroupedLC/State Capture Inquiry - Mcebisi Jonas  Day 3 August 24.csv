The money was in a black plastic bag wait for testimony @Tshepang Tlhapane Take the money and not take the job 😃 Butternut must come and account What I need to know from Mcebisi what legal steps did he took before going to media to report this Gupta crime Tshepang is a Gupta 
9:45,16:00, He must be quizzed about how he donated vast tracts of Land in the Eastern Cape to REIPPs & facilitated Multi-Million Rand Deals for them through the EC Development Corporation which reported to him. A WHOLE R600mil? 😂😂😂Not even their mines are worth that much. "I need to know which evidence does Mcebisi have in writing He is a liar the date he mention he was with Duduzane nd the Guptas was wrong Duduzane was not there nd he has proof of where he was in that day @Tshepang Tlhapane imagine mfethu... "this guy saved us from Zuma Hi Guys. Is this guy going to read all this document that he have? @The Edge Search Mcebisi did not report to the media# Why didn't he report them to the police?LOL 
16:00,22:09, How can you be so sure if Duduzane is not lying? Criminal always defend himself or herself aiy no this Leager is not srs "State resources is being abused here He shows us proof of he was not with Mcebisi in dat day Mcebisi claim he was with them in the ANN7 i why is the judge speaking english instead he should speak the language of the land which is Afrikaans troll alert everyone Afrikaans? just block

25:39,27:50, @Muziwakhe Skhosana R600Mil chap and you say No. Didnt know Jesus has risen. Oh tjo! "Gupta removed minister 3 times in a year It’s R600 000 first up in hand then once he agreed to take the position then 6mil be paid later stage mcebisi 'Pathological liar R1 000 000 000 000 000 000 This will sound like a hearsay "he told Zuma on national television Mthobisi do u think old man like Jonas can lie?😂 
28:04,29:27, Am not surprised with you mthobisi Zuma he should speak in afrikaans uZuma lied everyday nje Mcebisi Jonas made a statement under oath in front of the Public Protector. Now the inquiry start "Fils de please stop with Afrikaans unoath is only binding if it is taken in afrikaans "ndlovu How can the prosecutor dont know?

35:36,38:14, tell him Philani 😂 "John block run away after long court battle LoL Phila And it has began.. Who is this fella? has he revealed people's name guy? South Africa right?? this Jonas is sweating and shaking already p 
38:27,40:31, "They said it was Jonas lawyer "zee Jonas' lawyer is the Indian guy not Advocate Mokoena.Just for clarity @Elizabeth Diotlo clean your ears "i see that Zee "its not a lawyer John was saying the Indian guy is jonas lawyer not Mokoena that was his handler no lawyer """with due respect"" stop pulling that smug face and start being serious and nail the perpetrators" 
40:45,44:07, this is just a waste of time "it's weak really to identify so many mistakes now because he is scared "@peter pott this is common btw "They got to him "Not at all Sizwe "badkamer jonas captured himself we'll see. Not sure why these guys get a special comission... The rest of us just get jail cells until we prove ourself in court. 
44:11,47:15, """am sorry Mr cimmisioner"" you are delaying this enquiry with you're am sorry..." I am seriously concerned that such specific details have incorrectly been represented and changed this morning. Its these changes that will weaken the case put forward by Jonas @Sizwe Nkambule you shouldn't be concerned. corrections are commonplace humans make mistakes 😃 Who want to kill him Michael? @Michael Holmes hahahaha @Michael Holmes why dont u go to police since it seems u have proof that they out to kill him Politicians in this country always get special treatment when they have to face the law for their criminality. Ordinary citizens are sent to jail before they could even say their names. Not fair. Can you prove your allegations? 
47:15,50:25, "Michael is right That means people must approach media houses for evidence This is just a waste of time and money. Even these Inquiries are a waste of time cause no criminal charges will come out of them... "NPA has all the evidence to persecute these clowns. SARS how is this guy questioning M Joans? Where politicians are concerned no criminal charges shall prevail. yes Marvel NPA do have evidence but they are sitting on it not prosecuting anyone "Holmes "LOl 
50:35,52:52, Hahahahaha Jonas found out on TV that he was fired. Hahaha Imagine knowing that you've been fired through the media😥😥 "Romeo we are today because of news you are talking about Eish Michael it is so sad hey Jonas has now relaxed and he is becoming confident... Marvel just said there's evidence by the NPA.Angsazingeni "Ramatshela Think about this....if his life ...and other's were threatened.....then they have something very big to loose...don't you think guys. They wanna die martyrs 
53:36,59:45, next time take pictures jonas! you see Amarosa recorded the President and certain staff members zuma is a dangerous man It looks like Duduzane was powerful during his dad tenure as president "Now it seems most of these politicians are corruptible "hate him or love him "jonas is skelm too Interesting revelations "weakness too Yena Ayakwini?? 
59:55,1:02:31, "lol maybe its Ajay as deputy minister you exchanging sms and calls with duduzani Zuma LOL @ talking like a radio "Wow he sounds like Dali Mpofu he soims How do you as deputy minister get in a car not knowing where you going how does he remember all these? Interesting. 
1:02:33,1:04:02, "did he say he sounds like Dali Lol Gupta's have information on him and the one's close to him they prepared it b4b "Buy why did he go there from the 1st place he is reading his statement "Zee he has written them down lol What makes some of you think his lying..don't provoke our sober minds 
1:04:03,1:05:45, "@Marvel Ramatshela they drove in Duduzane's 2 door mac. Not a state vehicle. Rewind "The ""old man""" In control of everything? I know I mean when he wrote his statement how did he remember all the details It seems like at first he wanted to work with Guptas but something happened and he changed his mind .. why is he smirking the whole time. i like him a lot but the smirk kind of bothers me or smile. maybe he's nervous "600 million was offered rha imali yethu R600m 
1:05:48,1:08:09, "Lol yes Michael we will varaza it did he record this somewhere on his Cell phone or his just saying with no prove? "Now Mr jonas "R600m "How does a man oh high statue like him "Desmond Masilela it was gonna be cash @ general When is the Main Actor going to take the stand? Thank you @ Chris Pretorius 
1:08:27,1:11:25, @Keke khura that's a lot of money. hope he was recording "Desmond Masilela how many people would say no to 600 million? uyingwenya Jonas lol.... "Judge Zondo's voice though.Tjerrr i envy this man Mcebisi Do u have a bag. Lol. This begins to sound like the bold and the beautiful Oh my! They had R600m In cash! 
1:11:27,1:12:35, I can't wait to see him answering questions from their lawyers. This sounds like fiction R600 000 in cash not R600m "If the truth comes out I have to give it to this man. He fought with a lot of demons on that day. Mr Gupta had repeated that they had information on him and if he says anything about that meeting they would kill him R600 000 in cash immediately not R600m needed a big bag for all that cash hahaha "Jonas was just chatting with his friend 
1:12:43,1:16:05, it is reharsed True that Qhawe "yes it is rehearsed that is True Micheal. One of the first principles in a shakedown is to instill fear. "Jonas u are a true Leader Why is Nene not coming forward? or is he one of the witnesses that will be called ? "come on deputy finance minister! you don't report to Nene Jonas ufike ngani eRosebank njengoba sebewuyisa e Airpot nje "if this was not true as some of you seem to suggest 
1:16:08,1:17:55, Hahahahaha...... @Maskandimusic onlive ... it doesnt make sense. "I am not gonna lie I would have taken the R600 Serious u should have told J. Zuma the one who appointed you. Instead of telling your friends. Madlala 😀😀 Missed calls. Duduzane was buzzing you Jonas not calling you. "don't cry now @Philani_Why sell out your own people? "Philani Madlala 
1:18:03,1:19:09, "Lol Philani Our country needs honestly leaders like this Mcebisi Jonas all i wish is for sound south african to c the damage caused by zuma and the guptas.the aftermath of their shinanigans is there to c ASSUMED @ Maskandimusic at first he said they drove to Saxonworld now they fly. where did we leave his car? honorable Jonas now we can call this guy honorable not lamasela ase PARLIAMENT afuna siwabize njalo why not consult the president bt pravin? I would take it and run 😭😭😭. I once took money as a loan from Fnb and I ran after😭😭😭. so why not 600 million? "This matter must not go to court of law 
1:19:26,1:20:59, We are being taken for a ride here. haiiii Mr Chair ... "Peter He did not trust that they'd give him R600 million "The fact that it does not make sense to you "so pravin "pravin was not in treasury that time We need ppl like Mr Nene in this country in the beninging 
1:21:10,1:22:18, in deh beningiii I trusted this guy so much but he's disappointing me. dis is de man for our future south African "the rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer duduzane was the one who wanted to offer jonas money your future Malisha he is also a human being who knows what they said to him prior to this inquiry @Zee Zee what were u expecting? Is this South Africa i was born and raised in? 
1:22:35,1:24:48, We are still waiting for him to open a criminal case against them for trying to bribe a govt official. Is that a requirement of the Prevention of Corrupt Activities Act? yes skhosana many of you would have sold your soul for 600million curries "If they can threaten him then He really needs to do better at reading his own statement. Mmbwa i do la mmbwa hafha Afurika. Hu na zevhezevhe ndi la nndwa. Ri khou dzhia shango lashu murahu with or without Matamela Ramaphosa. back to your evidence baba lol zevhezevhe rolipfa ubva kale mr jonas was suppose to take the money and use it as evidence

"mr Gupta said if i ever suggsted that this meeting happened they would kill me 
1:35:07,1:37:11, @julius malema warmed us several times about the guptas and we didnt take him serious.remember julius malema speach in Mangaung with zuma in presence "This was an infighting of anc Hilton this is not the end the more truth will come all the ppl he mention they will respond nd tell us their side of their story @hilton malema is our prophet we need to take him seeious "Like all other enquiries - only a recommendation will be made and NO convictions serious "Uneducated political deployment costs South Africa Yaaaaaah neh.
