time,-47:59,message Ms Daniels should have legal presentation at this enquiry. @Diane Louw Not sure what they are getting at-that is standard wording for a minute/submission. Very often not 100% accurate esp in non essential matters wonder if there have been complaints re Koko and that she is not being handled strongly enought "@Heather Durr I missed the ""kerfuffle"" with Koko. Can you recall what day it happened It's up to her to seek an attorney to try protect her from hanging herself with the rope offered by Zondo and Seleke. The perjury that she's committing here will lead to her being arrested for perjury @Naledi Barron 3 December Evening session Mentioned under Koko @Heather Durr the only thing that i can assume is that they know she did not write those reports/memos and they are trying to find out who did and hopes she reveal it Thank you @Heather Durr !! x

It is in every individual's power to highlight a message @Sabelo Nxumalo yep Hi @Alta who is giving you stress? pin everything to Koko😁 
31:34,32:31, Alta lite it up baby girl Apology accepted lets move on its pity for Ms Daniels to lose her job becoz of being a whistle blower These madam seem to be lying Koko is all over here This one is sent here by somebody.she is not reliable how are we "Judging from what that KOKO guy said last week PREPAYMENT Only in sunny SA 
32:37,33:37, @fuzile dazana !! There you are!! Suzanne maybe caught up in a lie. She's the Company Secretary. She is essentially the Head legal. She can't say she was instructed to make an irrational submission to the board How did u guys feel abt Kokos opening statement and Koko/molefe effect of successful eskom @Sabelo Nxumalo she the company's secretary and not a decision maker. I'm sure there are easier ways to rob SA indeed DCJ is very cautious this time. @Jacqui Baumgardt I am on Linked In but I cant even get an interview-its soul destroying @Angelo Doubel her role requires that she advises the legal position as regards the company. She cannot make an excuse that she didn't know or understand. 
33:55,35:11, Miss Daniels was working with Koko and Essa in my opinion she might have had a change of heart unlike Koko Angelo is it a normal thing for the secretary to lie as she has just lied? "koko was more convincing who this just come in content plz "Company Secretaries play a central role in running of a company and the board thereof. They are in the centre of the business. They are the ""keeper of the COmpany's secrets"". She cannot claim not know" "@Heather Durr I feel for you my dear! It's crushing "@fuzile dazana hello @les gp. what's the role of a company's secretary? 
35:31,36:44, Kabelo come n watch on Friday Koko exposes lies for Daniels Naledi i dont work im the laziest person ever """Boss"" is a friendly term used between buddies." ANC is the reason she is sitting there you tell us "Adv Seleka "The roles are under s88 of the companies act. Also while you are at it just jokes My money is on KOKO now. are they progressing or she is spinning 
36:47,37:27, @Louis C 🤣🤣🤣 I read those comics as a child. Its her I tell you😅 @Angelo Doubel ... I understand this role Something is not adding up with these other eskom people @Naledi Barron thanks for the information. I will ask her👍 @Roza E catch 😁😁😁 Koko will gogo to prison in 2021 @Angelo Doubel xx Alta got it ta koko under the bus 
37:37,38:38, @SAL SA keep on dreaming Wow. Talk about being flustered "@Sabelo Nxumalo I will be watching Sal I don't think so.that one knows his story.he got proofs @mpitimpiti Koko looked convincing cause he was not properly questioned largely because of the chair. "@fuzile dazana  seems koko is linked in everything Kabelo I enjoyed his testimony and answers too "They trying to find out who is lying 
38:47,39:47, the train @Bongani. Dreams do come true. Anyway he's been implicated by so many "They are not typists. Drafting means drafting a LEGAL type position for a board or comms with outsiders. Not drafting like ""my boss may want to have said""..." Steven linked even in Daniels assumptions🤣🤣 yes @Andre Gerber @Sal Sa only wet dreams come true Kokota Koko kokota hay kokota Koko🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃😂😂😂 @gugulethu dube you question a testimony only f it has holes. That's all I can say. @fuzile dazana Train infrastructure was stolen and the train was torched. 
39:52,40:38, @Andre Gerber .... both🤔 @Andre Gerber they are all lying . ie they are all equal but some are more equal than others @les gp who should be responsible for signing off this R1.6billion deal Ms Daniels is loosing it Holes? More like craters! @les gp she did minutes ago urber The board @Angelo Doubel. @Angelo Doubel keeps minute book vets and prepares legal contracts depending on her level 
40:40,41:06, hello.Khanyi @Sal SA you too can decide with what you are prepared to deal with. if one is on the receiving end of these type of remarks it looks a bit differently. an insincere apology is an insult This lady was the company secretary a position referred to as a company lawyer with the level of incompetence she displayed here at the moment hello @Diane Louw @Khanyi Age.gracefully Lady K!! GTSY!! Khanyi hello Hi Bongone hi @Edward Baloyi She'll be exposed on Friday 
41:21,41:46, crazy thing is this sort of thing is going on at the moment in the country at some level and people think they will not get caught. "wait for friday "@mpitimpiti it has so many holes "Hope your day has been well "@Diane Louw ... Lets say you are a COMpany Secretary.. You can hire ALTA hello SEXY LAUGH.. MRS DANIEEEEEELS. @Heather Durr thanks for the Quick lecture. highly appreciated 👏 @weaverbird b sad but true 
41:47,42:39, Apologies I cant shut up-the round robin is never signed in a particular order especially when signed in counterparts. Some directors want the most senior person to sign first y does ms daniels get so flustered when mr koko is mentioned She has just lied today🤣🤣🤣🤣 @KayOw253 fireworks from Koko on FRIDAY How are u @Diane Louw @Santa Kriel. Noted "Im well Alta BARBIE GAL CHECK MATE "@Diane Louw ""Her job is to correct..."". Remember she has to be entirely there to see for legal issues. You can't type and be thinking about legal risks. It isn't possible." 
42:40,43:25, just busy Bongzs yours? well thank you and yourself @Edward Baloyi Her agenda is to throw Koko under the heavily loaded truck She's pulling one over us. this lady is testifying for the umpteenth time "@Cruda Bex hello there hi Cruda. "this is not Parliament @les gp Cosec has NO powers to hire-she is not an executive. She is a senior member of staff 
43:33,44:08, when you look at these amounts then how much better would the country have been had money been spent properly fine @Diane Louw trying to make new friends sorry all im xo OUTA and AMABHUNGANE will leave Miss Daniels in the cold😊 "Stop the greetings @M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily​ Strait yes @les gp thats why they are trying to find out who actually wrote those letters she just fowarded it... @Heather Durr .. I didn't say she hires.. I made the point that Eskom has the capacity to hire. this corruption from a to z are actually so sad did these people not think about schools hospitals do they have a conscious.... how do they sleep at night😞 
44:12,45:12, She's been used Greetings @Edward Baloyi @Temz @Diane Louw @Cruda Bex hi @m4l I agree....a whats app group should be created them @ALTA they do not think about anyone else but themselves. Enriching their own pockets at the expense of the nation. EVIL!!! white men will use you and leave like that... trust me "She lied in parliament and lied the first time she came here Greetings @Naledi Barron "@Magesha Difa 
45:12,45:40, And greetings to @Canis Africanis and @Cruda Bex ! Verified by Gupta's I suppose @les gp and @Heather Durr. so the civil lawsuit of R3.8billion made by Eskom against the previous board will hold up in court "@Alta how can they think of such while they get best education M4L is this your house perhaps? H alt these dogs and pigs have no skaaf . only think of themselves @Diane Louw Anything off her desk is her responsibility. No-one else's. @Rita @M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily It is being polite. Just ignore if it is an issue for you true @les gp i agree with you... 
45:45,46:41, Naledi Barron more love for you from here @Cruda Bex Thank you! Luvvies back for you! San... 👍 not very helpful today.....🤔 Rita u ok u seem left out "@Angelo Doubel I don't see how it can't.. However you must be able to prove that the board did something negligent. So Suzanne is that person who ""advises"" the board on such matters." @Naledi Barron you ....in offering drinks This Daniels......🙄🙄. Something fishy here the so-called patriotic whistle-blower will crack and crumble today and on Friday Koko will deliver the final blow to her fabrications 
46:41,47:32, Ms Daniels is showing some incompetency in answering questions @Sanfran Arnold exactly @Diana Louw...a secretary prepares what is DICTATED to her.. It’s not her decision! @roze I'm great Oh sheez @Diane Louw My bad. G & T anyone? It is what it is... lol @Naledi Barron "@Angelo Doubel She will be left with the sack. Remember that Boards are constituted by multiple disciplines. Entrepreneurs @les gp okay point noted 
47:45,48:32, @les @Diane Louw I am stunned by all these obligations and powers Cosec has @Bongane I said that this one is a liar "Diana Louw @Margareth Waterboer hence all the questions about who made the changes... "@Angelo Doubel It's going to be a tough sell for courts to place the blame at ""Dudu Myeni"" if there is a Company Secretary on the Board. They have enormous powers. Even to report boards." She's s not just a secretary she's a company sec and give guidance to governance issues Naledi dont forget my juice plz This lady was used to do dirty for same ppl @Heather Durr we learn daily of these changes - mind boggling.... 
48:52,49:46, @Naledi Barron a tripple pleeeeeeze @Roza E No worries! Mango?Orange? Apple? "@Angelo Doubel Board members and especially the C.S. is expected to be a strong individual who is empowered to ""Protect"" the board for the board to function 100 % all on board must be corrupt. @ALTA Coming up skat! Why was she meeting people if she was Company Secretary @Naledi Barron 🤗 Daniels came with mentality to come and implicates others as scapegoats. She didnt see this kind of questioning coming her way "At best she is complicit to the wrong things that happened at ESKOM 
49:49,50:33, @les gp tjo 😱 so we have a long way to go. before anyone will goes to jail. Naledi apple plz "This lady was clearly a AA candidate... at least thats what she wants us to believe. Like she was a ditzy blond... Unfortunately as a Prescribed office and why was she then sent to a meeting to take minutes if she is a company secretary - thats then beneath her..... imho "@Roza E Fresh for you She so much hopes to not be asked extremely difficult and self-implicating questions - and she's currently winning. @Angelo Doubel A claim for damages depends on many more things than resolutions-it depends on fraud or negligence Guys a company secretary is a company's lawyer let's be clear on that please "Is this a credible witness? I just don't see her as someone who's helping the commision 
50:33,52:03, Naledi😘 "@Angelo Doubel I don't think anyone will anyway. Perhaps she may DCJ will be active on Friday @Heather Durr Agreed "Will all this processes reach prosecution I'm a Bad liar! Bad Liar! Now you know. You're free to go @Ndivhuho Maxwell that is exactly what she is doing @Cooler Cat Is that a given? Can a Company Secretary NOT also be a lawyer. @Heather Durr - your opinion please? "@Heather Durr @Angelo Doubel However the C.S. in this case has her goose cooked. She's at the scene of the crime 
52:13,53:35, @Heather Durr so we have a long way to go. before anyone will be prosecuted @Roza E its nice being here @Naledi Barron @Cooler Cat Yes they can be as they are two separate functions "@SanFran Arnold Edward u welcome sir Thank you @Heather Durr x @Ndivhuho Maxwell And Shamila Batohi will help save her skin - she will not go after her - the colour of her skin makes her deserve to not be further investigated In my opinion a CS is not the legal advisor to the Board. Even if he/she is a qualified legal person @les gp tjo😱😱😱 
53:51,54:46, is ms daniels not here to give direction on the emails nd letters @Heather Durr Explain..hahaha "@Sal SA Exactly "@Ndivhuho Maxwell the parliamentary committee said so @Sal SA correct "Sal SA she has that responsibility @les gp. Legal opinion is not a CS duty as per the Companies Act @Sal SA a CS is definitely not a legal advisor to the board "@M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily 
54:51,57:01, The COSEC does not sit on the board in any function @Heather Durr why articulate this about @les gp? Praveen your heroes knew nothing and now this traitor as well "@Sal SA Per the act @Sal SA Exactly-you have a Group/Senior Legal Adviser and Cosec only sits in board meetings to take minutes and not give advice "If you were listening earlier she said so herself Sal SA @Les gp. yes only in implementing the law Well said @SanFran Arnold "Mr De Ruyter 
57:12,58:57, "@SanFran Arnold "@Naledi Baron @Angelo Doubel He has overstated the role of Cosec to that of a Board Member "Sal SA if she is dealing with implementing the law "@Cooler Cat A succinct difference. But I hear you @Sal SA.. to know of which laws... Corruption for instance. The use of and meaning of the PFMA in SOE's etc. Those are all legal laws they are expected to at least understand enough to ADVISE Any one who doubts state capture with so much evidence presented is not ignorant but an collaborator or enabler. There is too much evidence & the involvement Koko and Daniels the question is of degree @Brightwell Kunene. Definitely not @Heather Durr what's role of Cosec? 
59:03,1:00:05, @Sal SA ... That makes that role very very legal heavy. It's not a position to be held by someone who is not at the least prepared to learn of the legislation that governs that industry. @Sal SA Can we agree to that? hahaha....anniversary. ..Lol Mr Seleka @Angelo Doubel I explained it above @Louis C whats the de ruyter comment about? @Louis C ek soek ook so werk @gugulethu dube Succinctly stated! @Heather Durr okay 👍 "THESE GUYS MUST TEACH EFFS ADV.

1:00:12,1:02:26, "Sal SA MR SELEKA IS A SNIPER There is a financial deal that went wrong between her and her fellow crooks - and now she's paying revenge by trying to come clean in the guise of a patriotic whistle-blower. Wolf in sheep's clothing. "@les gp. I definitely don't agree @M4L TV - Free Downloads Daily That is exactly 100% correct @Heather Durr can miss Daniels be held accountable for these deals? "Ndumi  "@Sal SA .. You have to distinguish with whether the role requires legal brain all i hear is she convenes meetings and forwards emails to all - what legal work did she do.... 
1:02:46,1:03:33, @Manelisi mnguni ill be more scared of Adv Seleka than of Adv Hofmeyr @Sal SA 100% must she now advise on the law relating to everything and every Act that we have very nervous laugh maam "@Sal SA They don't necessarily have to be legal minded "@Manelisi that's why I was disappointed with the chair with regard to Koko "@SanFran Arnold B @Les gp. Companies Act clarifies the CS role "@Sal SA .. aboard meeting for instance. The C.S may gat an opinion Watching this is a total waste of time 
1:03:52,1:04:53, @Angelo Doubel No unless they prove fraud or gross negligence on her part and even then the Board is the responsible party as they sign off on it "@Manelisi mnguni "@Louis C I still don't know why he is to be suspended.

He is always hunting racism and not legal principles @Louis C I will keep an eye out. We all know it will be because he is embarrassing them. @Russia Magezi Yes he (Dali Mpofu) is a brand of celebrity lawyer with a soft and fluffy mind ... perhaps Seleke doesnt know what point he's trying to make either? @Sal SA now imagine typing notes and guiding the board with legal position as affects the company...

"@SanFran Arnold Accurate and on point as always 
1:11:23,1:12:34, I wonder if he is trying to point out the speed of the decision or possibly did she have much more to do with it than just acting as a postman MPOFU has become a perpetual loser don't allow Satan to brainwash you... they did it to our great grandmas... let show them that we hard to be brainwashed @ALTA Wa' my skons??? @Naledi Barron Yes Seleka has a point he is working towards Don't think Seleke has a clue of what he's fishing for. ... just following random lines Mpofu and Mkwebane should partner in faining to understand the law @Louis C 😉:virtualhug::virtualhug: @Jenny Whitewaves GTSY.

Foundation building happened long ago Seleke can be irrelevant at time "@Louis C sorry give the man a chance to do his work @Jenny Whitewaves hello there. Yes everything was rushed and the reasons have no backing documentation except for the Gupta's and Duduzane telling them to do it. Adv Seleka never goes on a fishing expedition.

Work horse with nothing to show for it. She was part of the deal and then they kicked her out and now she is noors" @Lionel Smith for sure. She is captured by Zuma and the Guptas. She is not incompetent lol "Can we force the court to open the sealed CR17 campaign's bank statements via the constitutional court and the ""promotion of access to information act""?" @Khayelihle Xaba Agree.

1:29:34,1:30:37, "@Naledi Barron ...Brownies..Rum soaked "Who cares who funded NDZ17? What could those funders be getting out of their ""investment"" now? However - it's only logical to be interested to know what CR17 Funders are reaping now as""ROI""!" I wonder if they stopped for a minute during all this fraud and corruption to think for a minute... would they have stopped? They were reckless. There is no law that compels the exposure of Donors to political parties at this stage @Lionel Smith i agree fully lets not pick and choose lets investigate everyone across YES DCJ!!! ...give her change..
