Guys in ESKOM operated like a MAFIA "its disappointing for S i like white people koko has a lot of explaining to do BEE and Affirmative action is why I am unemployed. We are also the only country that has affirmative action for the majority of the country.

1:12:45,1:16:32, "@Thando Nkutha With such a high unemployment rate in South Africa @Pheladi Lamola The time for playing with these criminals is over. We should do what they do in Saudi Arabia to thieves and chop off a hand The dumb ones would be highly intelligent compared to the smart people in South Africa. Thanks @Anne M. & @Felix Muyoba "The danger into accepting one version of a testimony is that you may miss the relevance of the other!! Until Koko @Sthakathi Khumalo They will not confirm these allegations - they will lie through their teeth as they always have "because of koko v Which make it difficult for me to accept this one version as the truth.. I want people in the field or central to give me evidence/corroborate as opposed to theories @Derek Main with straight facesü§£ü§£ü§£ 
1:16:51,1:21:02, @Derek Main Or develop amnesia when they come before the commission Thando Nkutha and Molefe So in your views people which version should we take? and if so why? @Sthakathi Khumalo What do these people testifying against the looters have to gain - nothing. Whereas the looters have every reason to lie "@Thando Nkutha yes but they decided to become corrupt "@Sthakathi Khumalo The commission investigators have checked all the affidavits "So like Hope in ten years time we will really c new south africa.free of greedy people free of corruption. this adv is giving facts with confirmation 
1:22:00,1:24:22, "Anne M. Compromising as they are these emails "@Thando Nkutha that is where the judges need to decide MARIKANA /MARIKANAMARIKA khumalo with kokos. "@Sthakathi Khumalo That's because these thieves messed up Eskom so much Derek correct "@Thando Nkutha an educated man ruined graduates and destroying them by putting money hopefully the tribunal will speed that up 
1:25:11,1:28:19, @makhosi nobhatyi where does the whites come into play here? you are just race baiting @ Sthakathi Khumalo They cooked the books and lied. Eskom was basically bankrupt since 2015 There is no way we should blame whites we have authority to change South Africa but our leadership were busy enriching themselves ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I agree that they are a embarrassment for black people "there's another reason y black people should be outraged as there people represent them and thus should be shining examples of excellence Where do you start to fix this mess??? there are such amazing black people but these corrupt people make their name bad As a South African I would not say embarrassment foe black people but embarrassment for South Africans 
1:28:21,1:31:08, We are outraged @Christian W but our voices are not heard because we're not politically connected. "@Christian w my apologies I was trying to reveal something here these people who are implicated here always come to media criticize whites knowing that they are beneficiaries  What is interesting with watching so many of these inquiries is the body language of people who appear sincere and honest vs those with hidden agendas and who are clearly dishonest "@Pheladi Lamola I can understand that @makhosi nobhatyi ok Yes Christian and notice that the innocent dont refer to their files so much cos they are telling truths @Jane .Blamire Another way we can start to fix this mess is to vote wisely in May no wonder Guptas ran away...... they were milking our country.... mara why anc sold us out The choices are worrying Derek 
1:31:26,1:34:03, @Lwandile Radebe Because for the ANC it's always been about self-enrichment and stuff the people "Andre Gerber I hear you "@Thando Nkutha President appointed another arm of investigators to investigate funds we lost Yes Derek all must think hard before their X and they have or will host R100m wedding in Dubai. cry our beloved mzanzi @Lwandile Radebe they took us for granted..that we are stupid and we will not detect their deception..they were wrong!! "The Eskom saga for me "@Thando Nkutha i read it ""properly"" my interpretation was just out." so theoretically the guptas caused load shedding 
1:34:15,1:37:13, "@Sthakathi Khumalo how can you call a thief clever @Sthakathi Khumalo We need IPPs - it's the only way forward It is Gupta did load shedding "@John-Basel Ioannou Yes Commissions are here to figure out the amount and who is responsible then only the law steps in President mudt move fast and arrest these thugs before they remove him at the NGC China is already in - Taking over Eskom Felix Muyoba- I hear he is a clever black.. and Derek Main 40 year contracts are just capture at its highest points. If they are kept they must be given one year contracts haha "anne.m I heard for every stage it the equivalent of a billion per stage.eg stage 2 =R2billion
