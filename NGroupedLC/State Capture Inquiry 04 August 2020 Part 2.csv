"All over the news @Carl...These skelms in charge will steal flowers at their own funeral Carl Botha looks like we have a new corruption pandemic with Covid19 PPE I think the sudden interest by ANC in investigating corruption is linked to getting the IMF money Will be just enough to get the bankers off their back but no real high up who have stolen the big money will ever answer Just saw the Car Park field Hospital and the shacks that was built in Limpopo ü§î "Hi @Pastor J 
12:09,18:52, hy "@Jenny Whitewaves It works like that in big Corporate s as well pastorj I see Gigaba matter is also backfiring Hawks have a please explain to do @Elvis....I have been following that closely and I think the Hawks are at 250 feet and still digging bro. No sign of stopping. This is an abuse by another Politician. No warrant to seize it seems We must get the Scorpions back Elvis @&___Mr_____& ___Abhi_____hy who built these houses? "YES ! @Pastor J . Unfortunately corruption is endemic in many 1st and 3td world countries. S.A is not unique @Naledi...We certainly have more liberties and we scream from the highest rooftops. Sadly most times when corruption is endemic by the ruling party members nobody seems to listen.Arrests must happen 
19:51,23:24, "@Pastor J.

26:23,29:25, the lady judge made sure shes djc boss @Elvis...I will always say the same thing...Batohi is the best the system will get but the surroundings is restrictive....If the ANC is all in jail Parliament will be legislated as a Prison Pastor rite now shamiela bathoy cant do nothing @Roza...She is being limited and held back by those dark forces.Give her real Independence and the entire Govt will be in Prison and she might just send Malema there too as a bonus also Pator did u notice with enca u cant post ur comments when they reporting on something "Democracy is a sword with 2 sharp edges. One cuts through the corruption and crime "pastorj south Africa needs firm and strong leadership including the president @Roza eNCA is becoming another ANN7 it seems Pastor the president gave her the position of head what more does she need 
29:38,31:56, @Elvis...Very true @Roza The ANC gave the impression she has independence but did not remove the handcuffs that they put on her yet "Pastor they need to wake up looks like they still in lala land @P>o>I Thats very true....We can do with a few clowns in that place. Or should I say a few more perhaps. "Not the best entertainment around How much of LA k of arrests is legal staff shortages to prosecute? lack.... "@Roza essack. I hear you.

THIS BEE THING WAS THE PROBLEM TO START WITH @Zakhele and LOOK AT YOU its quite clear the ANC is only for them selves well... @Riaan DW there is a difference between desperate and believing the lies and desperate for change 
1:04:51,1:06:04, Soon People will rebel and we will have anarchy out of frustration. We will then have change but no one is there to lead. Anyone who says Malema is going home early.hehehehe "Riaan WE DONT WANT BEE @Zakhele complaining doesn't help... be the change u want to see in this world.

The ANC will have a very hard time holding a majority in the next election YES LETS START THAT MOVEMENT so we need to focus our attention on the business principles we heard and start small business that will buck the ANC STRONGHOLD ON BUSINESS and us. we have too few businesses in ZA 
1:21:58,1:23:26, LESS TALK NMORE ACTION PLEASE Tshabalala if ur family and parents was never killed by Apartheid government u will say. but i don't blame u. b4 1994 the whites looted this country bankrupt. Ciex report and other reports doc tht. Who reckons Ace M. is watching this? @Sean....The problems seems to be that the UAE will protect its economy rather than defending honesty "@Deborah that's not ideal. look at the DA All political parties are there to serve their stomach let that sink in WHEN IS THE MOVEMENT STARTING "the DA is a shadow party and has lost its way in the dark. thi was apparent by kakhuisen saying that ""of ramposer does not stop the lockdown the people will"". that was like him imitating Juljus" "@Riaan... that's simply coz of the ""once bitten

1:29:31,1:30:44, So those that are invested here are insane @zakhele tshabalala.

SUMMON THESE THIEVES. Contempt if he was ordered to appear and absented himself without justification i need to get my faith back Really seriously consider......no duh! 
1:33:01,1:34:33, Zondo you are eating tax prayers money. it's obvious these witnesses feel no urgency nor respect for your commission. "Flat tyres @Abel Matshidiso happens everyday in our courts "Like the ANC they dont respect him anymore coz hes not asserting himself üëå Than if that's d case we are a banana republic ZONDO IS CAPTURED "No assertion

There is no sensitivities at all being shown in any matter at all since the commission began. it's so slow and costing a total fortune. With no results at all. Anyone know how much this commission is costing per day? 
1:37:55,1:39:40, not taken seriously at all. @Peter Staffen..@Maebye...Infogate/Herschel Rhoodie? a starting point It costs a lot @Bophelo Malapela ...it doesn't matter.......all should still show respect etc etc to the commision....it's the right thing to do... The state capture probe has cost taxpayers R700m so far. It has cost us 700Million and more Another witness dodging? What will Zondo do? "NPA and Hawks were hollowed out @Bophelo you are 100% 
1:39:41,1:40:59, the chair is happy to come tomorrow just for appearances and no proceedings at all "This commission will be extended even next year what was achieved today 000 and now?
