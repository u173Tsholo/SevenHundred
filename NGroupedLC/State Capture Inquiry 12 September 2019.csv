The way they treat/manage tax payers funds. Am I having de jevu? Hlaudi is undoubtedly the most incredible witness 
1:20:16,1:21:05, "Hosea M "Hlaudi's strategy of obfuscation is working. Looong stories which deviate from the current questions The Chief Pessimist award goes to @Rob Nel Thank goodness..

Hlaudi knows what ppl want to hear – and he plays to the audience. I'll give him credit for that. "@Thando Nkutha he will always claim he has proof  This one just deviates from the initial question.. ALWAYS. I have a feeling it was his plan I was the Board! did you hear someone fart? Let's not forget from the parliamentary inquiry into SABC that Hlaudi used to tell people he's going to Pretoria if they didn't do what he wanted. And obviously it'd be their signature on documents.

This is not a court but a commission and he must be consistent with all the witnesses. Hlaudi is there to testify on his affidavit/evidence

"Paul Buchel  Concluding remarks please chair!! "by the way hlaudi thought that he was doing well true the power that were given to him and forget those who appoint him and also failed to think how they appoint him without proper gualification That lawyer is Zimbabwean... "This Hlaudi legal representative just wants to shine He is confident and I think he stated that he was not here to determine whether he was right or wrong but rather to give evidence to assist within the commission Loot Loot! 
2:03:21,2:04:33, @LYD online tv True... I thought this Hlaudi lawyer took that free flight to Nigeria yesterday or he missed it There are 2 policies....SABC policy and Hlaudi policy....when evidence is produced we can all make up our minds with what went down and who is responsible....I am glad I am not his lawyer 😀😀😀😀 LYD online tv that lawyer is African 😂😂😂😂😂 Hlaudi a dream interpreter In Zimbabwe how is the media doing? The lawyer grilling The Hlaudi looks like she would have whipped The Hlaudi if she were his Headmistress "He knows how to promote for money for curries wow such power in Zondo's hands

"what a relief he knows what he is talking about If Hlaudi was in the right he would not have been fired.

2:15:07,2:18:59, "this media has become a very dangerous tool. if you can analyse its pattern Enough! Enough damnit! What is Hlaudi's super power...blowing his own horn. media is killer poison Media has ceated and designed this monster called the State capture... "Hlaudi is handling it just fine @Sibongokuhle sithole firstly who is the media Sjoe! The brain of SABC!!! 
2:19:07,2:25:00, As most of this evidence that we have is something said i media circles ... Couldn't even get a matric!! Shows why the sabc is in such trouble Private sector has lot of matricless whites that are making it or crashing it@Trevor Gerntholtz “I still put it to you Chairperson “ Hlaudi’s legal lingo is improving Damon Radebe please produce evidence of this statement hlaidi was used because he thought in he's mad mind he was and is right "Damon No @Peter Staffen And he lies!! Wits Business School has clearly come out to say he NEVER lectured there 
2:25:02,2:27:40, Ever I wonder who is buying his suits for him now? @Damon Radebe substantiate your statement. I am extremely curious as to where you found this information. Fake news???? Define unqualified in this matter @Trevor Gerntholtz No I don't want to @Craig Johnson @Craig Johnson don't waste your time Damon Radebe please do not make statements but cannot prove it "You living in a cage @Trevor Gerntholtz. There is a vidoe of him providing a lecture there as invited by Wits University "@Craig Johnson just like Hlaudi 
2:28:15,2:31:47, "Damon Radebe "I just did @Peter Staffen  He is unqualified as he does not have a matric. Surely having such a basic qualification is necessary for such an important position ? He is a total buffoon "Define the word ""lecture"" @Trevor Gerntholtz" """Private sector has lot of matricless whites that are making it or crashing it"" SOE are crashing the economy. The private sector is one of largest tax income for ZA. Who are you going to blame next?" Damon Radebe please were did substantiate it you aliar as well "Why is it that Africa 300 and million plus😂😂 this guy is a fool 
2:31:56,2:35:40, it's because of transformation that's why sa is in this lots of rubbish A lecture is something that forms part of an academic syllabus. WIts themselves have denied he lectured there. Are you saying that they are lying Damon Radebe? This one wants to be famous. "official definition of a lecture -an educational talk to an audience @Neha Rabi What does that mean in english @Damon Radebe Are you trolling us? There are White people in Private sector that are manager to Chartered Accountants despite not even having a matric @Trevor Gerntholtz and @Peter Staffen state capture at hand "Only qualified lecturers are allowed to lecture 
2:35:40,2:37:15, @Damon Radebe Evidence please yesterday the Chinese were jumping fences running from the police! We are cleaning the country I'm not trolling @Craig Johnson just stating facts @Damon Radebe certainly looks like it. Chinese must go back to China they can make a donkey president and it will be fine because the horses won to much races Ok what is this lawyer complaining about? Im so lost hle @Damon Radebe I dont believe you. Show me these facts @Damon Radebe I am really intrigued 
2:37:22,2:38:40, education is not everything....ROTHCHILDS ARE NOT EDUCATED The newspaper articles about Hlaudi the Chinese have china city in south africa no something is wrong in china we dont even sell fat cakes! "thus bad  the state capture is such a waste of time whats the outcome going to change? I like Hlaudi. Frank and to the point "​""education is not everything....ROTHCHILDS ARE NOT EDUCATED"" Keep saying that to yourselves. See where it gets you." Knowing when to consult someone with specific qualifications and experience takes someone to recognize that they don't know everything. Taking a decision without the facts is simply poor management. "@zintle ndzwangu about some ""articul"" lol" 
2:38:50,2:40:18, Poor baby... can't take criticism!! @Leeroy Lepere .....Leeroy my special friend. Steal anything nice recently?????

Apparently SA government came up with the word. lol "Imagine if everybody demanded that Zondo has to deal with the Media because they felt they hadn’t been fairly reported upon  Sabc is poor so when this is done how much are we getting? or is this just another stunt by the media to confuse or stirr us away from the real problem which is white monopoly 
2:53:36,2:57:44, #free the frequencies So is he saying that set top boxes were a scam? "This Commission is just Window Dressing  What I like about Hlaydi is that he can DEMONSTRATE R10bn later‚ government dropped set-top boxes...where did that money go?
