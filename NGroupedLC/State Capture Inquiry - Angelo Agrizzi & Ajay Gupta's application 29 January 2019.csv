Baleka was protecting Zuma without apology there lawyers are sitting behind behind and to the right and left. yes Khumalo I'm interested in Baleka. was she mentioned anybody. So Bosasa was keeping large amounts of money in their premises to be able to dispatch R 300000 every month to Zuma and Dudu Myeni? So they were allowed to keep so much cash in their possession? 
35:57,37:17, "Correct Where is this Mr Watson? is he around SA?

41:21,43:02, His health took a toll on twitter that is Has Watson really disappeared. is this true. @jeevan singh no one knows where watson finds himself. @Yandi Masina There is no denying when there are recordings. Agrizzi is brave like Hlaudi ba nale that thing @jeevan singh Knowing our Hawks and NPA I wouldn't be surprised if the man is at his house or job. No one bothered to go look for him. @ jeevan l will disappear too it is tough herr they are letting inmates walk the street? 
43:06,44:48, i wonder what the jail sentence for agrizzi will be? obviously he is also guilty of state capture They release criminals to go sort out people. watching this from university of zululand' Rohan. I hope all these people's has been blocked at emigration. everyone of them is a flight risk. Anybody working today? Agrizzi will walk.. he dropped bombshells as long as he didn't lie about anything. maybe house arrest "Agrizzi There would be no jail sentence for him. the rule is nothing he say to the commission can be held against him in a court of law This guys are straight core Mafia 🙆🏽‍♂️

Agrizzi is now being caught with his web of lies...... That was better by the chair bcos it's not about racism but whether his testimony is credible and factual Vicky 🙏🏻 We live in Hope 
2:34:14,2:34:54, It may happen that all these he was saying was motivated by hatred of a Black people lets focus on corruption this is the problem in south africa. mob psychology Cannot see link between calling someone who is threatening to kill you the K word and whether the evidence you present should be analysed for accuracy. "Stop this factional fighting Are your'll think this is a joke? #Kuzonyiwa @Phillip we don't know Robin Brown - It is leaning that way - more & more! This is the Commission of inquiry into state capture not inquiry into Agrizzi's racism. Let's get on with the inquiry. I'M CONFUSED 🤔🤷😭😩😵🙆‍♀️

I think Pretorius was wrong and bias to conclude that Agrizzi was motivated racism to come testify... Agrizzi must talk to his lawyer to protest the conclusion made by the evidence leader Pretorius Lets not be bogged down with his racist stunt. What he gave in the last 6 days is more valuable than what the detractors are trying to achieve yes Thabang. The laptop!!
