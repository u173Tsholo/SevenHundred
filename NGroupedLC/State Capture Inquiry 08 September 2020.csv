"@James Godloz He did not ask because JZ made sure his puppets were appointed to the board 
27:57,31:06, he's even wearing a corrupt suit useless individual sies.. "if so i can see why Zuma wanted him there u took the instructions from jz strange he did not ask him for his reason. a coverup for jz. let me put it to you another way.. let me lie further morning from cameroon This is a tsotsi of Zola from Soweto """ SLEDGEHAMMER DCJ - MR TSOTSI WAS HEAD- HUNTED SO HE WAS COMPROMISED AB INITIO ( FROM DE BEGINNING)." this people should be in jail by now..

34:35,38:11, dont tramp on DCJ toes today he is really serious @Kevin Davis I wonder what he actually did when at Eskonm for his R8m pay cheque each year? Eddie he is innocent he used to go with Brian Moore to uncle Tony shebeen Mike lol gave access to the gupta machine to enrich Am loving Judge Zondo's direct questioning. NPA needs to strike the iron whist it's hot 🔥 They need to axt immediately after someone appears at StateCapture "Mike is it true It means JZ knew the agenda to be discussed chairman of the board doesn't know the rules and laws all the board members are just puppets used 
38:13,47:03, well done genius I am waiting to hear Chair I don't remember "Sit tight lol for the sake of completeness chair still not happy with the answer. how do these people manage to justify their actions when they know their actions were wrong. seasoned criminals. "@Syug @Syug Absolute puppet on a string. was minister Lynn Brown also corrupt she was captured 
48:03,50:11, @James Godlwana yes she was captured mara why Tsotsi my brother it's GODLOZA Tsotsi is a stooge and a typical of the cader deployment now he is singing Kahle kahle what did this one do My apologies to you mr Godloza i can't remember her testimony but i thought she was anti Zuma Mr tsotsi was the worst ceo of Eskimo yhoo this man mess up Eskimo 😁 its like looking for a needle in a hay stack to find one or two ANC members that are not thieves 
51:12,56:29, "@James Godloza Godloza Gordhan said to Brown(who lied in parliament by the way) that the ""ANCdoesnt steal in millions the ANC steals in billions"" -so she is ANC yes so therefore definitely corrupt.🤒" "can one of this guys just tell the truth i do that Dube "She is a Zuma supporter but towards the end of Zuma terms "James who cares are you not happy he did bro long winded going n Apparently he found Jesus I think Aggrizi he was tired of this nonsense 
56:35,1:03:47, "i am Oh wow that is great news for him. Praise the lord Where is Mr Notshe??? @NOXOLO GUMEDE bra? this evidence leader is boring.... He is only boring if you are looking for entertainment rather then facts. All evidence leaders need some vuma-nyana. I wish most of them were like the blitz #AdvHofmeyr! its just very slow which makes it difficult o pay attention ExacttlyNoxolo 
1:05:05,1:10:16, I understand your point. There we go...! The surname suits A directive to stop the business of Eskom does seem sinister and does raise fundamental questions. eeeeee This chairman is impressive. As chair he allowed the president and minister to encroach on his powers hi @Syug without even putting it in writing which suggests in itself an incompetence and subservience to authority without accountability. 
1:11:47,1:14:23, Who was the minister then fellas? I wish there was a way to claim back the salaries paid to people like Mr Tsotsi here.🤦‍♀️ All bucks stop with the voters holding executive accountability ESKOM failure is national economic sucide before covid added the coup de grace "Tjoe! Tsotsi that one Who are the voters? @ Aubrey He has to honour his surname "@Patrick Lol no maan Thobani 
1:14:27,1:17:26, @Patrick .Solarnfo Do you agree eskom faiure to be able to supply enough electricity is as fundamental a failure as any country can make. "No No Aubrey lol 🤣😂 I entered the fray on the wrong foot there is nothing one can do when the appointing authority is cracking your back.just calling. @Noah Kids 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I was about to say that😂😂😂Tsotsi klaar Load shedding is in itself an admission of epic failure. It's not dust buildup on insulators like we got when this started. "Bottom line WHEN DID WE ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED REAL LOAD-SHADING? @Patrick .Solarnfo So you think load shedding is something routine in a functioning country> 
1:17:52,1:23:08, "@Aubrey De Bliquy  :yougotthis: @Patrick .Solarnfo are you aware of the disruptive costs of load shedding to industry? Sme factories are disasterously disrupted. Mismanagement can occur at any entity without corruption being in the center of affairs @Patrick incompetence that is not in Eskom is incompetence de-facto in government. I like the slight smile on adv's face. Lol...is this adv a brother from another mother of Adv V. Maleka. hahaha @Patrick .Solarnfo incompetence in business is regulated by bankruptcies. Eskom cannot have a monopoly and plead incompetence thus holding all hostage. you need not go further chair. the visits says everything. 
1:23:59,1:25:54, hahaha... This is a very strong procedural process which is encouraged to the point of transparency in conduct of business :chillwcat: "@Aubrey answer the question How so? he's stalling I was very impressed by Andre de ruyer The frog in the throat is croking. 
1:26:01,1:27:35, Because the matter of Eskom is quite complex and now i am lost at exactly what we are taking about @Patrick .Solarnfo My point is that Eskom cannot be allowed to hold a monopoly over a vital national service they are incapable of providing. Yes! @Aubrey De Bliquy -agree I agree OK sane people agree Imagine Eskom sponsoring the ANC January 8 gala!!! Eskom funded the ANC dinner? Yet the law provides eskom a legislated monopoly on electricity supply thus holding the economy to ransom 
1:27:56,1:29:44, Tsotsi is bringing a new phrase 'I seem to recall' which is ambiguous. Let's listen carefully 🤔 @ Thobani. attentive The dots are connecting hahahahaha very surprising Syug that Eskom and the SABC were funding the ANC dinner this Tsotsi guy is dropping names like it nothing "@Patrick OK This commission chair is on point. Zondo and his herbal tea 😂😂😂 nail on the head 
1:30:06,1:32:37, sabc is behind enca has adjourned "I wonder how many hours does Zondo really sleep guys "@Lungisani Mabaso I would have loved the judge to verfy tge names names of the top six who were there @Pheladi Lamola I think their is a corrupt mindset that cannot comprehend the concept of conflict of interest. "@Ntwana @Ntwasa No body talk about injuries and victims and victimisation again and again. the power abuse and transperancy of statutory bodies around Europe? . Police administration and individuals cases? Justice? Gwede Mantash is an obvious case 
1:33:24,1:36:59, I see Eskom failure as a collective failure not to be laid at the door of any one incumbent because this infrastructure requires 20 year foresight and planning I personally don't see what's wrong with Eskom sponsoring some ANC events. It can have a direct impact on increasing your profits. "As long as Eskom continues to be an ANC project and remote controlled by politicians @Luyanda. Think again bru "If there are influential businesses and corporations attending the function LOL @Luyanda A That is called corruption. Don't you understand conflict of interest? He clearly doe not does.. @Tebogo Sibilanga On point. 💯 
1:37:16,1:40:04, "Explain how it's a conflict of interest guys I am not sure how Tsotsi is gonna answer the question on the table. The ANC must answer. Why do SOEs find it appropriate to sponsor events of a political party? Wena Luyanda u must appear before the commission of inquiry at how dont u understand that is wrong @Luyanda A It creates an opportunity for corruption and would you object to Eskom sponsoring a DA event? Or even Freedom Front Plus dinner @Luyanda - whose profits are U referring to? Eskom has been making losses every year for the past 2 decades @ least!! @Luyanda A these are political parties not charities or would you support ESkom supporing FF Plus "The role of Eskom is to provide quality and uninterrupted power supply to the citizens "No I don't object to that at all. The DA for example hosts many functions with leading business role players 
1:40:09,1:44:06, Why do companies sponsor events? "@Luyanda A Eskom is granted a monopoly service vital to the nation. They provide a service that provides 20 year planning. which could span EFF Yours and my money Luyanda is giving the money to the ANC "Yeah @true Syug "ramaphosa knew all the time about corruption but did nothing "@Luyanda A Actually your question is exactly why this countr a failed basket case.The DA can be sponsored sure BUT NOT with tax payers money He is just playing with our minds It's the ANC..... the TOP SIX. ... the GUPTAS....... why always. ..... 
1:44:20,1:46:06, @Salome Seabi Perhaps that says more about the consensus on corruption than CR who the moment he had the authority as president declared his intention to end corruption as he now is doing. are they still on tea he said 11.30 Do you think a guy called Tsotsi can be honest? "BY law going to start now steam is running @Mike Clark I think even a private company uses OUR MONEY since we allow corporations to profit off our economy and people. we are back the action continua like aluta "@Mike Clark Haha 
1:48:36,1:53:24, "@Luyanda A But it can be extended. Companies sponsor events to win favor. Normally more favor means We cant say like FU eskom we are going to buy our electricity from a company that supports EFF. "@Luyanda A My apologies did not mean to offend The point is we can see how easily the ANC could use this sutority to fund ANC functions. Guys lets educate each other not fight on this platform What's happening here? sbongile.meaning the president was in one roof with the guptas @Patrick .Solarnfo agreed lets learn Wasnt Zuma supposed to come again? or im misled 
1:53:57,1:57:43, Yup @Patrick .Solarnfo 100% agree. Any incumbent could use authority over eskom to sponsor party political functions. I never joined the witch hunt against JZ and feel the same about CR. "Concur with you Pat  Zuma must come to give us answers "You see? Zondo is explaining it nicely here Question is why do SOEs spend money at preferred political rally? Lol...''i dont remember'' should be invalid and unlawful now on. hahaha And this money is our taxes guys @Patrick .Solarnfo Zuma has been sick since so they say Eskom is a cash cow for the ANC vultures. They want the entity to remain monopolised so that they continue to feed off it. Nomvula told us his husband was confident of an eskom tender 
1:58:28,2:00:08, "@Tebogo Indeed Aubrey *Deputy Chief Justice 😉 "for me it's a blessing in disguise for Cyril to have kept quiet then the witness is on the corner now deputy yes Needless to say thou Welcome Sally anc gala dinner is alwas a breeding ground for massive corruption to follow 
2:00:22,2:02:31, "Exactly i.e.e unlike justice Zondo he should not be in government. Does not understand the basic spirit of service. "People say if you saw something wrong Seems he cant see a way out of the corner hofmeyer would sink this tsotsi Exactly he must accept A company with a monopoly should not need to influence government. It just has to be efficient in service delivery. yes yes 
2:02:46,2:04:11, @Nthabiseng I thought it was my network same yes I thought it was my network also I've been busy refreshing my page all this time sabc is always a problem who's sabotaging the network now. they are busy grilling this croony We can open a political party in this platform "He is telling the truth...They wanted to reach the customer 
2:04:17,2:06:14, Tsotsi wase Zola yeeeeees political party n i b the president "Where's this Tsotsi from "Let me be the president Yes @Salome Seabi As a borne again Dagga user I was watching the Trial of the Plant when SABC and the state and their amicus causae were trying everything to stop scale of harms evidence being lead. yoyoyo This business of the ANC prostituting MP's for money was always unethical & darn right right disgusting.They are public reps' & should be available to all not just those that can enrich the ANC. it was definitely 21st century 
2:06:27,2:08:07, there you go Tsotsi🙈 "@Ngema Tsosi wase Zola is in trouble today.... Zondo decided to drink moringa because he is dealing with a Tsotsi this 1 looks to be a crook par excellence "The decision by all our ""HIGH"" court that dagga use in private was a constitutional right was the ""hight"" point of our thriving democracy. LOL" "The majority of the people who are voting for the corrupt ANC have no interest in watching this blatant corruption on full display in FHD. As long as their ignorance remains embedded @ mike these cANCer guys don’t care I am thinking of his kids what they are saying now tjoooooooooo do you know when this tsotsi is lying??? his lips move big 1 
2:08:15,2:10:52, @Akhonamandla Gala 😂 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 "CR should have dealt with corruption earlier. people thought they could still get away with looting the State coffers @Thobani Mkananda No offense taken. To each is own. "@Greatnation69 I wonder how all this ministers of zumas time justify visiting private residence of anyone on a basis of discussing the SOE'E "each one of us has relatives in cities very surprising "@Aubrey De Bliquy 
2:11:25,2:13:23, Tsotsi is a cinfident liar musiclovet apparently this dinner was in january 2014 before votes. was cyril part and parcel of that top six confident yeb Now is the time we need to preach the gospel of voting out the ANC REALLY THIS IS THE TIME NOW "@Thobani Mkananda A bit off topic ceryl is not clean at all "Mr Tsotsi has that Bill Cosby guilty looks now kushibile iF HE WAS CLEAN HE WAS SUPPOSED TO START WITH DEALING WITH THIS CROOKS FIRST SO SAME POTATOES 
2:13:44,2:16:11, @Gala u r right in future meetings to discuss State business should be held att state venues. "@Sifiso "@Aubrey @Mokadi that is the point powerful curry This crook is making this up as he goes along... @Mohamed Mia I know 😳just airing my frustrations as we learn why we are the new basket case of Africa 😩. They are indeed the cANCer ofg our once great country @akhonamandla 😂😂 they must force him to come to the hot sit because now we have new evidence that he must answer to 
2:16:23,2:18:17, ba tlo motshwara o Gupta Curry Recipe: @Thobani Mkananda Don't get me started on the COVID19 panic-Demic. A pandemic of stupidity. We have a life threatening virus so like lets close down the country and destroy ppeople income for survival "@Louise hE IS GOING TO JAIL OO yeb definetely he pocketed some money "🤣@Aubrey TO Old for Orange overolls 
2:18:40,2:20:27, the guptas targeted the crooks. "You get lies CUBA AT OUR OWN EXPENSE @Johnno D 😂😂 tell me about it! that's a CROOK CROOK ok "@Tebogo Sibilanga spot on. I experianced the same attitude with the whites under apartheid Anyo the gupta brothers is a mafiane who had a cordial meeting at saxonworld with jo computer 
2:20:30,2:21:54, "Mandela said ""If the ANC does to you what the Apartheid government did to you then you do to the ANC what you did to the Apartheid government.""" This Mr Tsotsi guy is singing loud I tell you😂😂 he's snitching on all those other crooks 😂🤣😂🤣 @Aubrey please don't go deep because you'd find yourself preaching to the converted or worse solicit a backlash. Let's leave that for now Even too old but they must pay the price really we cant go on like this "at least his being partly honest I don't recall the name 🤔 hay wena Tsotsi OK i get it bro Prison was built for the poor who have no access to quality legal services. Not for the politicians and the rich 🤣just imagine a snitching comrade = impimpi 
2:22:09,2:24:52, Eish Tebogo you right tebego spot on Agrizzi was not labeled impimpi.... sing Zola Is telling the truth is piemping? but u dnt remeber the individual "@Tebogo before they became parliamentarians this guy is being honest If so one has to choose between piemping and perjury and jail. it's not as if in UK there's equal justice. Ours is the best constitution in the world. the problem is the politicians who can't impliment

2:28:12,2:31:42, @Thobani i agree 100%. it's just Tsotsi yaseZola is a comrade so i didn't expect him to be impimpi Some people do not understand the concept of rule of law as opposed to mob rule. this candidate is still in the employment of eskom tsotsi doesn't want to tell us. "I love this lawyer "@Akhonamandla "My original surname is Gupta. Now i wii change to Pillay Eskom should lose their monopoly the moment the load shed shows they are incapable of meeting the needs of the economy. These advocates need some Red Bull "@Thobani 
2:32:24,2:34:07, "@Alex Wy not report to Police this meeting Mr Tsotsi President freinds I was instructed by Zuma to go there. let us all make electricity and fit two way meters to feed the grid.
