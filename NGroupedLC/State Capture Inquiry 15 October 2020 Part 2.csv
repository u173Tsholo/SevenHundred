29:14,31:02, is Todd giving the commission some refresher course here? I got the feeling he could have killed someone and stull would have been reinstated. @Owen Nyilika Zuma Messiah @Thabo Mokoaleli problem is he is a partner at Bowmans Adv Myburgh also an xpret on labor matters. Siyabonga Gama is the guy that Barbara Hogan did not approve him but Zuma insisted that he wants Gama as CEO of Transnet 🤷 @Sheperd Moyo yaaaa neeeeee "@Christopher Peters yes he is @Owen Nyilika yeah 
31:03,33:34, @Charles... we’re all receiving refresher in service training... @Thabo Mokoaleli exactly It also obliterates you’re memory "possibly the most important SOEs for a functioning state @Thabo Mokoaleli This issue makes one get so angry Your iyhoooo corruption @Tommygun True. @Thabo Mokoaleli that is impossible because Mr Toddy was involved at Transnet and RET brigades will accuse him of playing both sides

41:01,41:48, "@Tay @ZalisileNdzala They pulled out when they pointed out misconduct and were ignored "Please don't go to Senekal people "@Zalisile Ndzala @Thabo Mokoaleli Correct.

Bell Pottinger toxified Political Debate in South Africa 😭 I when we have agreed on a price and the job is done pay me if the boss is crook prosecute him

Ok @Thabo Mokoaleli I get it. When will the debt be settled? "@Freddy Pummer Ms Molefe was very professional and a witness with much integrity anyone whu is going to senekal must carry a gun🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫 Thus Adv Todd former Transnet lawyer@Russia Magezi by the way did you listen to Juliarse's interview?

44:08,45:44, This man is giving opinions. Let's move on. We wasting time. a crowd of more then 15ppl are not allowed to carry fire arms when protesting "Bell Pottinger passed away in Britain last year "@a b c There was a murder of a white fam manager @Summer de nobrega yes I totally agree with you. Smart. @DCJ think a follow up should be done on the GNS R96m contract price escalation in 2 years @SanFran Arnold Yes I remember that part So many issues still to arise from Transnet. Hold on till we hear about the contraversial locomotives deal that took place:shelterin: Amazing how the witness microphone works perfectly today.

51:10,53:20, He is currently giving that speech @Trevor Moyake​ The EFF thugs are going to Senekal to incite more violence against farmers. Time to take the things out with drones. Former Financial Services Board ex Dube Tshidi had filed papers requesting review of the public protector's report on his appointment of particular attorney as curatorfor a pension fund. The sad reality is that it was coming down to that for a while now... the EFF have been waiting for an opportunity like this for some time... @san fran I see @Trevor Moyake 🤷‍♀️😭 Siyabonga Gama at Transnet and Brian Molefe Eskom two stooges of RET group Senekal can get ugly tomorrow. I'm gonna cleanse my eyes with holy water if I see him shake his booty on national TV 😭 
53:25,55:21, I really hope the all non-EFF sees this and rather stay away. To beat his game is to not play at all ANC offered R100 billion of our stolen money up for crabs. "Yes Mr. Todd Thats like asking for a snot klap You are wasting time on Christopher Todd. You have enough factors. Call Gama to the stand. @FieliesSA As usual... #FieliesSA exactly like you said! I'm just hoping the farmers won't let that happen buy bitcoin @Zalisile Ndzala time is almost up for this commission and theres no point to have a witness like Todd so long 
55:23,57:12, "@SanFran Arnold My Lady B I'm blaming Farmers for what is going on in Senekal.Y they hire illegal immigrants?I'm not saying is right for people to kill other people not right.Some of farm owners r not treating our people right y they dont come to the point..this was deliberate and willful @Naledi Barron see you Lady N:virtualhug::virtualhug: Ramaphosa Bribing us with R350 for the next three months from next month @Naledi Barron go well DCJ thank you for knitting all these things together hi diddy @jwarha21. Exactly. He is giving opinions. We want facts from the real culprits. 
57:24,1:00:40, Take that R350. There's so much unemployment right now that you can become a blesser with that money. I can't wait for the final state capture report @Russia same here "mr mayburg just say ""thank you"" to the chairperson" SANDF chief general Solly Shoke deploying soldiers to Senekal ...Zuma is a puppeteer but Zondo weighs too much for Zuma's strings. The European Union must maintain control of the African continent or parish. it's not Ramaphosa who gives the R350 it's from the tax payers innocent people are going to get hurt and Malema will be the first one to run away😭 "Fred

He is the man of integrity Todd vacuum leadership and poor political will More people need to come out and expose these shady practices happening within institutions... Love this witness. Much easier if you tell the truth @hlagala..only shortcoming..refuses to say this was a crooked behaviour..by crooks @ mr mkhwanazi has a bit of explaining esp after a labour law expert has laid it bare like this @abc..think time is problem 
1:11:40,1:14:30, amazing how thruth just flows @cassim suleman He could get sued for defamation "@cassim suleman True @Heather Durr Also he doesn't want to get shot around a street corner somewhere...
