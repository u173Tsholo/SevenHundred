time,-0:32,message goeie more almal goie more Russel south african time 10 is 11 thobela bagesu "The daily LIES it already 10 That “YES” from Zondo kills me 😂😂😭 waiting 
1:50,7:25, more lies are coming who is this Does anyone know when SUPER LIAR #1 and Thief in Chief is appearing again?????? im waiting for Mr Zuma to go to jail i like the tone of this white lady who suppose to witness today iBlondie yini? umlungu madona Mr Mathethwa cishe uMthethwa lowo 
8:05,9:15, Dizzy comes to mind Get with the program lady! when are we going to see people as people and not according to colour? We need to evolve South Africa...we are standing in our own way! Really Thando.......Grow up. Khulibusi ngiyacabanga uKhulubuse lowo Is this lady nervous or not prepared DCJ is going to postpone this witness Zondo is trying to be calm but angry deep down Antionette what does Blond mean? is it equivalent to saying white female? 
10:13,13:39, The legal team of the commission always not prepared BS Glorify Someone is sabotaging this commission. We can't be dealing with this issue all the time. People need to receive this rule 33 notices in time but there's always stories. Something gives me the impression so far that Ms Buthelezi has now got some stiff competition with this Advocate. I`m watching from University Of Limpopo. and i`ve no idea as to what is actually going on. @Antoinette Rader what is your answer? i'm asking seriously So it's just the hair ? none Blond means fair hair. Even I know that:)) 
14:06,18:55, So it's a problem that i didn't know? here we go The evidence leader is butchering names there but its ok And you actuality spell it BLONDE @Robert Russell noted and i guess you didn't see my other concern about the Blonde lady She has almost pronounced all the names wrongly How can one get Mthethwa wrong lol it's heppenning in SA this time eish in South Africa 
19:33,26:35, I think the problem is the Chairs hearing. @Missie really? if you say so Chair is losing his hearing batho The Chair is really losing his hearing @Thando Nkutha he wants the whole pie not a piece I also cannot hear what the witness is saying.. fruits? what is this witness on about Guys we have waited and fought for democracy. This is the very same division and discrimination that have brought us to this point. We are a diverse nation. instead of c Maybe the fruits part is an introduction to the Tsunami he's going to unleash 
26:40,31:32, Minister Chabane was one of the VERY FEW honest ANC cabinet ministers fis nd sips "instead of criticizing differences too much details "@Thando Nkutha its in our nature What is he saying? Zuma has to account we are looking that now @Sindiswa Moolman It seems like a lot about nothing so far. But I suspect that something beeeeeg is about to hit the fan....... alone or a loan car 
31:33,34:15, 😛 Thanks @Pastor J. smoke Minister smoked? i didn't know Shabane smoked Smoke?? Is that even allowed for Ministers to smoke? M in the Presidency What if minister was hiding his smoking habit and now this mampara is exposing him nah i doubt 
34:29,36:28, Collins Chabane remember he was always with people playing music So it's probably us the public that din't know i doubt he liked smoking like Mbeki The Zondo commission is a year old already Mbeki and his long pipe will even smoke in parliament lol Remember taxpayers are paying for their co "So far we've heard Smoke I watched most of the commission in direct and is getting worried how much longer it will take 
36:33,39:40, i hope we(taxpayers) didn't pay for the minister's cigarettes @Tshwane Yamošate Lol Lol 😀 Zondo Fish and Chips Commission "Cigarettes @Magda Seguin DCJ said in the interview he's going to ask for an extension. WoW! thanks @Anne M. gov communications services i think its the comm depart of gov Maseko was head GCIS: Government Communication Information Systems 
40:02,41:43, @Magda Seguin Mr Zondo recently hint that might take over a year to go and I think is really worthy of it. Most of the time those against the commission is people want hid things. thanks Mohale for correction He is corraborating Mr Maseko's testimony yes True @Ibo Thabo over and above that he has also mentioned Manyi @Ibo Thabo Agree "Does Zondo knows hw much is wasted in this commission mara gave 
43:06,46:59, Why can’t the commission have all in & out calls & conversation correspondence in the presidency? Why the commission can’t have all call records of the Guptas? @Kabelo Katjedi Do you think Judge Zondo won't deliver a fair report? "The Seriti commission had a completely different mandate Won’t be surprised if JZ accuses this man of being the agent of the enemy after all this testimony. This Advocate seems very nervous Andrew Feinstein who was an ANC parliamentarian resigned ans wrote a book called 'After the Party' he relates the arms deal shenanigens in his book @Anne M. Sometimes I have questions for the intelligence or sharpness of Mr Zondo "@Pastor J Yes "ANNE M he might deliver a fair report bt based on the testimonies or statements frm different witnesses 
47:26,51:15, With the public and NGOs knowing about the failed Seriti commission all the minute details of the Zondo commission will be disected.There is no room for biass @Ibo Thabo Possibly to lull the witness into saying more than they want to? "@Kabelo Katjedi If we as non legal people can see through the lies and BS of some of the witnesses when this guy comes back. I foresee sparks... Manyi and Zuma came here and lie where there is smoke there is fire Spot on @Anne M. Another one who was not honest was Bruce Khoalane "ANNE fair enough  empty hall 🤦‍♀️ 
51:40,55:14, Indeed @ Magda Seguin The testimonies of the witness today is very important as they worked inside the presidency Abednego is a biblical name...lets hear the truth..lol @Magda Seguin 😆😆 Next witness is going to lie here 🙆🏻‍♀️ Hlungwana 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ isn’t Guptas puppet? "@Anne M. No I was just joking @Ibo Thabo @Anne M. I guess that is why even top law experts like Sikhakhane didn’t want Zuma to utter more nonsense when then later will hunt him 2/2 Minister Chabane died too soon. 
55:42,56:52, "But not Watson  @Ibo Thabo You're right. All this evidence is now a public record. Gavin Watson Sindiswa "@Pheladi apparently it’s true "Yes @makhosi nobhatyi Different guy I think. Fana Hlongwane was the bag man for the arms deal. This guy testifying was in the Office of Presidency working for Chabane. "ohh myself "@Thando Nkutha  That’s can only be a suicide then @Philadi Lamola 
57:06,58:25, @Thando Nkutha with JZ anything is possible Car crash apparently @Thando Nkutha Wouldn't put it past him. Do you reckon @Sindi?😳🙆🏽‍♂️ Oh yes let’s hope he is not going to lie @ Derek main It’s confirmed... it’s Gavin Watson Is Gavin Watson 71 "His driver was speeding at night on a national roadster He drove to a concrete barrier @TG Swartlane 
58:30,1:02:05, Sindiswa Moolman ​It’s confirmed... it’s Gavin Watson Please post the link. Thanks. According to news 24 it was a 71 year old "@Sindiswa Moolman  Bosasa's Gavin Watson has died ... #POWERTalk It cant be Agrizzi...the headline says Bosasa exécutive...Agrizzi resigned years ago The AFU must start the asset forfeiture before they go to the beneficiaries. That may sound cold but we need our monies back. "@Sindiswa Moolman  Enca said it was Gavin Watson The news 24 report was released +- 10 min ago 
1:02:21,1:03:42, "@ Sindiswa Moolman is true? If so may his soul Rest In Peace 😂😂 Yes Sindiswa. We want our money back please. SABC just announced that it is Gavin Watson who died RE Gavin Watson - that's very fishy. I smell a rat. The criminals must be very happy Why don’t the commission asked the phone records between Zuma & minister Chabane? Record will speak itself 💃💃💃 With all the political killings I sometimes want to be a conspiracy theorist.... Seems almost like a Brett Kebble suicide. I dont know why our african brothers n sister keep on voting for ANC N THEIR FRIENDS in our neibhouring countries 
1:03:56,1:05:49, "@Derek Main very fishy indeed very truthful indeed MrAubrey is sniffing his zinger sauce again @Makwa Choma No thinking person can understand that. gaven whatson has died Watson wanted to die. Why was he driving a Toyota Corolla when he could have driven a Porsche "@Magda Seguin Hmmm we need clarification on that Zuma lied. 
1:05:54,1:08:01, Gaven Watson Bosasa boss has died @carnoth ngomane There are other Bosasa directors that can still be called. "we need the full records of this call The fact is Gavin Watson should have been in jail ages ago - before he could do himself any harm. Gavin Watson runs before get his 15 years EWN @Hosia Modiga. Hi to Twitter... it’s buzzing there too Go to Twitter @Hosia Modiga @Anne M. yeah but they might pin everything on him now that he cant speak for himself i have never thought ANC CAN change like this n become moster 
1:09:38,1:11:42, "Agreed @Derek Main. If the Hawks and NPA had done their jobs "the really reason for this state capture is to get Zuma and Guptas guilty  No@Thando Nkutha. He killed himself. @Thando Nkutha im thinking along the same line @Pheladi Lamola Yeah - they both got off too easily. okay...so is he going to say if Zuma or Maseko told the thuth? @Sindiswa Moolman Ala Brett Kebble? Yes @Derek Main I wish all the corrupt would do the same. 
1:11:50,1:14:34, They are still going to kill each other 😁😁😁😁😁 He drove to a concrete barrier @Thando Nkutha. ... R21 THIS STATE CAPTURE WILL CAUSE THE CAPTURE OF MANY INDIVIDUALS Let them kill each other. why are we voting for them?? It’s my take... Brett Kebble didn’t leave a note @Thando Nkutha "@Derek Main if they all do that we will never know the truth "Ngomane please help me 
1:14:35,1:18:15, Yes... I agree @Thandi Nkutha "If I was innocent Understanding Gavin Watson is dead somebody tampered with that car "Just wondering whos nxt onthe list "Kabelo i was born 1960 i was betean by whites many times just walking in town of Middelburg i suffered under apartheid if indeed its true "@Makwa Choma just look and analyse the voters demographics 
1:18:44,1:21:35, IT WAS NOT GAVIN WATSON IT WAS A FORMER BOSASA CRO executive of Haven watson RENEE LANE STATED THAT GAVIN WATSON WAS DEAD JUST READ NEWS24 "White Supremacy will always be priority here in south african  The body has NOT been confirmed as Gavin Watson's...news24 says there are too many 'strange things' surrounding the car eNCA is covering the story and it seems ligit that it is Gavin Watson Also read EWN @Niek tabi. They mentioned the name there 
1:21:53,1:24:35, GAVIN WATSON IS NOT 71 YEARS OLD!!!!!!!!!!! "Makwa i was born after apartheid but i have experienced racial remarks to a point whereby it goes viral on social media PowerFM also did @Niek tabi then Watch eNCA @Niek tabi. "Ngomane Who cant see that Mr Ngomane NEWS STORIES ARE NOT ALWAYS CORRECT "For starters

1:28:56,1:32:40, "I AGREE but do we know that by voting for Anc so many years we are building a GIANT that is going to bigger than our country Really? Are you serious @Thando Nkutha? Wait for a confirmation that it is indeed Gavin Watson I EVEN STOPPED VOTING FOR DA IN W CAPE Who needs to confirm that @Magda Seguin when 4 media houses have already done so? Hahahaha @Thando Nkutha Sho @Thando Nkutha Thando doesnt want to pay 500 000 mis-interpretation "ENCA NEWS 
1:33:25,1:39:14, SOUND IS FINE HERE what is this going to be called being 'bridged' ..? BUT ITS CAPE TOWN We need to educate ourself educate ourselves in what exactly? "@Magda Seguin I also don't believe Twitter "JS BACH LNE @MrAubery what has any of this got to do with the commission of inquiry in South Africa ?? 
1:40:41,1:44:32, @MrAubery wow you need medication bru Yhooo...@Thando Nkutha. I think all these deaths must be investigated. Thanks a lot got this info @Thando Nkutha where did this Farber guy represent Cyril? @Thando Nkutha How did you find out about his death? I'm VERY curious now. Wow Thando!! Gavin Watson just died a lot of gossip Thando bra Mhmmm... @Thando Nkutha @Thando Nkutha .hahahahaha. I suspected that due to the spelling being so correct this time around. hahahaha 
1:45:07,1:49:11, mmmmmmhhh RIP Gavin Watson and thx Watch this space Gavin Watson was murdered Was the lawyer his or of Absa Bank Thando Nkutha? NEVER TRUST SOCIAL MEDIA So no one will give evidence on the snakes and chicken braai packs and booze? Gucci bags too. THATS WHY I AM NOT ON FB "Mortuary has confirmed OR TWITTER 
1:50:29,1:53:25, Watson was on his way to the airport when the accident happened @MrAubery LoL where is the edge? JZ thought the commission won’t verify his testimony Gangster state 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ is Gavin's death linked to black magic? just asking And he didn't want to write his statement on the allegations.Why? As if he knew he will be gone by the time he is subpoenaed. True @ Thabani Trevor "YES SINGI Thts why i cant get it Trvor n not JZ was ANC WHO DEFENDED HIM 
1:53:45,1:57:15, HIS HEART WAS ALSO BLACK FROM ALL THE STUFF HE DID SABC HAS REPORTED THAT THE ACCIDENT IS BEING TREATED AS SUSPICIOUS. @MrAubery lol im confused. so we are o a flat earth that has no edge.? Trevor is ANC TOO "PASTOR Zuma keep harassing and intimidating anyone dare to say something against him and he is using those 100% Z boys placard holders to do his dirty work which then surely will say he know nothing about @Niek tabl ? Aubrey you are not rude but irritating. I will have to block you @MrAubery ohkay. so what you are saying is that other planets do not exist? 
1:57:39,2:01:38, 'Bosasa gave Zuma R100 000 every month' R100 000 OF CITIZENS TAX MONEY """Nomvula Nonkonyane was given chicken and beers'" thanks you what zondow is looking for these question he is asking now? Why doesn’t he ask for the phone records? "' Gwede @MrAubery I do not deny not do I accept that space agencies faked going to space. Im more focused on the flat earth thing. How do you guys explain gravity. So the mortuary confirmed that it is Gavin Watson....I will only believe it if I see his body...too many political killings in SA and in Africa.The scene is already sanitised. ' Nomgcobo Jiba was given a brown envelope.' 
2:02:07,2:06:32, Even if Gavin Watson is dead...... the Asset Forfeiture unit should not stop trying to get back OUR stolen money from his estate Oh and OUR stolen money from the ANC donations as well So are we going to ignore that fact that Gavin Wason was driving a Toyota Corolla? The car belonged to Bosasa Why Zondow never asked Zuma the similar question on why he remember something happened near 30 years ago in details? They better put some armed guards at that mortuary. Just now Watson inexplicably wakes up and flies out to Dubai via Waterkloof Air Force base on one of the Gupta planes fueled and paid for by ex No 1 There is an argument among news agencies of confirmation of Watsons death and if it was really him...Twitter is aflush with his death yet there is NO CREDIBLE confirmation that it is him BLACK MAGIC "Ibo Thabo Skhakhane will ask these questions 
2:07:14,2:12:22, what you mean?@Yolo More The cross examination Ibo Gavin had lots of cash but the car if it is true he passed on dont forget Cronje story. "These questions are the ones that they will want to capitalise on i wonder is true on the news coverage it didn't look like the air bag was deployed ? Not even sure if that model of * Toyota has an airbag ? @Yolo More My question is why didn’t Zondow sick to connect the dots on Zuma when he gave details of things happened 30 years ago?
