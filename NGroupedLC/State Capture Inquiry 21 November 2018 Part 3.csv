"BM Jones gave him a call "who is Nana now Nene NHlanhla n. nnnnnnbb 
30:56,36:12, Dots and other dots.... Pravin has captured this one "our country was a true movie NM. . NM HJ j hmm n mm MN Jones was from internal head of state/ agent of Gupta who decide who should in office or Not even fire whomever he wants it amazes me that how stupid some people are to think pravin was in league with the guptas when was among the 1st people to bring state capture into light white patriarchs control land money and jobs in South Africa and are all white men. black men dont control anything yet they are black femenist groups intend to fight us you can ask again Thando "@Thando Nkutha He was questioned but its his nature...he has a lot to explain ...

37:26,40:42, "@Thando Nkutha Once went into a presser with him Or detail.

"@Andre' Van Zyl But he was ""boring"" to most of us "When the get caught In reality SA Should be talking more about creating South African Banks to preserve south african resources including capital. We can't be banking internationally while our economy is not stable. hey mateðŸ˜Š Fuzile would have prior to submitting this evidence asked Mr Godongwana to include the sms conversation . from boring to riveting
