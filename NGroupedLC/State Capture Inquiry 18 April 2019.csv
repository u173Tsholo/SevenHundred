It is the EFF time to eat ✊🏿EFF @Cameron Kim The tribal law statement is insulting. Rather talk of customary law. @Simdisiwe Seshoka @Reformed Youth I see you can not answer the question. The ANC is rotten and captured Who said that no one is above the law? Alexander Dowding do you know that we are in Easter hollyday 🙈🙈 
31:00,33:33, "@Nosiphiwo Zantsi  All the skeletons tumbling out of the closet.ANC MP Majola recieved a R860k BMW from NEHAWU...The parliamentary document is online "Alexander Dowding Calm down wena There is no tribal law in South Africa. There is customary law @Cameron Kim In tribal law the is no corruption There is NO LAW in SA @Nosiphiwo Zantsi the correct name is Indigenous Law and tough at Universities- so stone age in my opinion Hawks probing R111m hospital fraud in the Eastern Cape @Bongumenzi Nxumalo Expecting the ANC to fix corruption is like expecting the Ku Klux Klan to fix racial prejudice. 
33:39,35:23, @Musa Bakiti is tribal law also applicable on non- blacks>? @John Wilson correct @Bongumenzi Nxumalo mfethu please tell me how many people implicated in this whitewash you expect to see going to jail? Black people are not a tribe. "Derek Main But you know @Alexander Dowding This commission is like the Marcus Commission regarding the SAA crash with rocket fuel on-board surely the truth shall set you free @Nosiphiwo Zantsi who is your King ? There can be tribes within black people. 
35:38,37:14, "Alexander Dowding That is true @Bongumenzi Nxumalo Of course we have to deal with corruption but the ANC can't be trusted to do it. @Nosiphiwo Zantsi who is your Tribal King ? Who is your tribal king Afrikaaner tribe is new black thing The ANC has made South Africa worst decline of any country not in war. The ANC is finished how idiot must you be to support the ANC. Have a brain and vote EFF in my lifetime✊🏿 @Musa Bakiti there are Boers behaving like Tribs Royalty is an archaic concept. They are nothing but parasites. What are we watching anyway is it not a blueprint of what ANC is? S Africa you deserve a savior

39:25,41:35, Dropping of cases was just through brown envelopes.. pity some have passed on nje If you vote for ANC you will get two sassa cards @African Refugee soon it will be 20% and then 0%. @Cameron and why r u still emzansi vele @Musa Bakiti That's the ANC I know - corruption at all levels. Edward Zuma's supposed R15m @Cameron Kim and now they have an opportunity to save themselves That’s she needs to explain herself @Bongumenzi Nxumalo @Reformed Youth if thing go over the balancing point then it is lost for many generations- like ZIM Venezuela ect ect and ...South Africa 
41:57,45:54, @Musa Bakiti I disagree but you believe what you want. @Derek Main name one country that is not corrupt 100% "@African Refugee @Reformed Youth relax @Musa Bakiti Antarctica 😂😂😂 "@Musa Bakiti - all are corrupt  @Musa Bakiti There is a degree of corruption in all countries but the ANC have perfected corruption. The scale of their corruption outstrips even Nigeria. The EFF trolls just woke up @rohan barnard we need to send Zuma there to learn 😂😂😂😂 We need to remove all MPs from parliament that have been there for longer than ten years. Because their mental faculties have been compromised due to suffering from apartheid hangover syndrome. 
46:01,48:22, @Musa Bakiti He will be the only person there 😂😂😂 Protect me from yourself 🤣🤣🤣 It is time for born frees to replace them. We need drastic measures to deal with corruption. I recommend chopping off a hand of the guilty. Young blood in parliament will herald real change "Panday is a menace to society @Alexander Dowding I agree with your last comment @Derek Main Join Islam and go to Iran We need minds that are capable of thinking outside of the box. The current crop of MPs are unable to do this. "@Musa Bakiti What for? If the punishment is effective there 
48:36,51:09, corruption is not a learned trait it is an inborn trait I think I have derek main blocked 😂😂😂 i don't see any of his comments... He must've over stepped sometime @david cele you will be blocked for electioneering behave please Derek Main is a Muslim who eat pork "@rohan barnard  @rohan barnard I blocked him long ago for insulting me @Musa Bakiti Seriously? How old are you? This advocate is a beautiful lady "African Refugee I agree 
51:29,53:50, One more election slogans from you @david cele and you are blocked "@African Refugee I block because I am not going to argue with someone who believe that their way is the only way. If you are gonna spew racist remarks "White person wrote it  @African Refugee I block people who spew racist bile. I don't need that in my life. lol Pour yourself a bells and chillax. Life is too short Panday haha.. a proper Anenias Mathe😂😂 @Derek Main keep your liver for Vodka @African Refugee that's the problem. I will fight you if you are racist and sexist. Don't call me names and compare me to a minority of right wingers. I will not stand for that 
53:52,56:29, Amigo case ? @Derek Main you are a racist @Cameron Kim Please provide any evidence you have. That's like the pot calling the kettle black. Peggy Nkoyeni was prosecuted for fraud of the procurement of radiotherapy equipment in KZN...long story My opinion is that you are mentally unstable if you are racist 🤕 @Cameron Kim EFF will sort them out soon @Derek Main because you have a colonialist name @Musa Bakiti I am 100 % sure of that ] @Cameron Kim Pathetic 
56:50,59:32, PWHC again involved.... @Derek Main that's rude "Judge is not too impressed with Ms September. He keeps correcting her PWC are brilliant. Best accounting auditors in the world. "@Musa Bakiti What is? When you have something significant to say Mayibuhye! and then iAfrika Mayibuye iafrica @African Refugee Just google that slogan again before you embarass yourself. @Reformed Youth - AFRICA (AFRIKA) the name is a white mans name for the continent known as Azania 
1:00:07,1:02:20, I agree anyone who is racist is mentally challenged Has President Ramaphosa promised to bring back the Scorpions yet? South Africa needs them back. Best fighters of corruption in government we have ever had. Hence why President 783 had them disbanded. @African Refugee I think its also a bit painful with the experience he has to watch a junior flounder trying to get into drips with a complex testimony like this. @Yvonne Morudu only white people are racists - I never seen a black racists - have you ? @Yvonne Morudu Thank you my the black spirits bless you. @Musa Bakiti My Russian friens wants to know if you have seen a tokolosi @Cameron Kim Ya your eyesight issues are well documented mos. @Thando Nkutha Is Batohi an ANC member? not seen but read one. his name is Kim 
1:02:54,1:04:52, I think it is wrong to say racists are mentally health challenged...it stignatise people with real mental health problems.Racists are narcissists with no empathy or humanism. @Cameron Kim Eugen Tere Blanche was our tokolosi we killed it. @Musa Bakiti LOL True Magdq Andile from BLF is racist and if you listen to him properly he sounds lost and troubled probably mad as well his not capable of talking he is always screaming a @Cameron Kim you have passed the degree of professional trolling lol "@Cameron Kim it depends on how you define racism. If you mean black people that hate a white individual simply on the basis of their colour @Danie Nilsen what is your point ? Do you believe in the tokolozi or the jewish gods? 
1:05:05,1:06:06, "@Cameron Kim if you are suggesting that any black person who hates a white person is justified in their hate @11soccerdad - No only white people can be racists "Since Busisiwe Mkhwebane "@African Refugee There was a magistrate in Alberton. Jeez man @11soccerdad Kim is trolling - ignore it. I only like white women because i can sleep with them Mad is an ancient word used to describe and promote 'witch burning'.The word mad does not define mental illness andile has a condition called Bipolar he should receive treatment "The ombudsman’s failing reputation has robbed Zuma’s successor 
1:06:09,1:08:43, @Derek Main do you believe in the tokolosi @Cameron Kim YAWN @Musa Bakiti I believe you @African Refugee please don't drink and drive in our black roads. @Alexander Dowding industrialization is a white - western thing the Imperialist did with SA The 'slush fund' theft coming up @African Refugee Cheers. Enjoy! no driving and eating hot cross buns to all going to Moira please use safe transport and arive alive 
1:09:10,1:11:54, @Danie Nilsen - safe transport ? are you dreaming do they still have that big Easter egg hunt where alm the people with silver stars go to to find the eggs. Hoy cross buns and drunk driving was a satire that is been peddled as truth don't fall for it *hot "@African Refugee Turned out Meneer Nel was plagued by PILES "@Cameron Kim the truth should be said  #MzansiTabletopGames meaning drivers that are not tired or under the influence and road worthy vehecle cant do much more This is boring now bring Agrizzi or Bheke Cele Chair 
1:11:56,1:16:13, @Danie Nilsen hahaha "Most of the wealthiest economies in the world are heavily industrialized i.e. USA I hope DCJ will now take something for the coughing @Musa Bakiti what is a coconut ? @Cameron Kim i realy do not have the time to talk to you so carry on trolling thats what you do best @I see nobody els is talking with you @Danie Nilsen normally if you lose the argument you play the man - like you did - @Alexander Dowding NO - do we need other countries to invest in South Africa ? does it bother you it does not bother me 
1:16:35,1:21:56, @Cameron Kim coconut is white inside Afrikaaner outside @Musa Bakiti DO YOU THINK THE Eff WILL BRING FOREIGN INVESTMENTS FOR SOUTH AFRICA Macbrie must be a minister o police an clean the mess Min Cele back to transport @Musa Bakiti is it not a black man too close to white people? @Musa Bakiti do you think the EFF can really deal with the whites in SA even the white population is only 4-5 mil and the black polulation close to 50 mil people @Cameron Kim we don't need investers we need market to sell our pretty Africa products @Musa Bakiti why are your beautiful things not selling now? @Musa Bakiti what are the top 5 products and what percentage of the GDP is that @Musa Bakiti dont you like white people ? 
1:21:58,1:25:22, Cele is 'secure in comfort' as Adv.Madonsela would say.I hardly see any change in the crime status in SA..he is doing squat in serving or protecting same yes @Cameron Kim that is is the only intelegent coment you made today @Musa Bakiti is the system you want to create working well in the poor Tribal Volkstate we are testing it in India @Musa Bakiti arwe you a racist? not at all "Of course South Africa needs Investors only a fool would think not. But no-one will Invest in our Junk Status thanks to the gangster comrades of corruption (ANC)and thuggery @Val Speirs that is why you must vote for AWB 
1:25:35,1:27:49, @Val Speirs SA is ungovernable and dood for the dustbin - will most like splinter around tribal lines does AWB even still in existence? @Musa Bakiti is the AWB on the ballot ? Moving to ORANIA @Felix Muyoba I quess there are maybe 10 or 15 members @Felix Muyoba AWB is the ruling party in Orania @Musa Bakiti 😂😂 @Musa Bakiti - and one person Voted for the EFF in orania' 
1:28:01,1:30:01, It is a separate state without the comrades of corruption @Cameron Kim what do you expect maybe that one vote is a black domestic worker @Musa Bakiti what is orania different for the Tribal grounds of blacks people in SA People in Orania believe Eugen Tere Blanche will rise from the died. Iranian is a tribal land for whites only @Musa Bakiti who is tour KING? is he balck? @Val Speirs who is your tribal chief? @Val Speirs No it is a semite coutry ( Arab) 
1:30:11,1:33:17, NP was absorbed by the ANC. @Dylan Burden The ANC loved Kortbroek v Schalkwyk Orania is flourishing it does not allow criminals to reside there. @Dylan Burden De Kerk sellout @Musa Bakiti I don't go to church. @Musa Bakiti who is your Tribal KING ? And from which Black Volkstaat is he ? @Cameron Kim A true king is the father of Jesus South Africa fast becoming another Venezuela @Musa Bakiti from which black Volkstaat are you ?

1:39:23,1:41:31, "They have law and order there Orania is a new Israel in Africa @Cameron Kim but that comparison is very much unfair to say the least @Marietjie Larney The EFF and Malema think Mugabe and ZIm is a success @Felix Muyoba why the Zulu King get over 60 million support and Orania nothing - @Felix Muyoba why do you say it's an unfair comparison? "Cameron Kim Who is the king in Orania @Cameron Kim? @Dylan Burden @Felix Muyoba maybe because the tribal Kings gets government money and Orainia nothing 
1:41:32,1:43:44, @Dylan Burden do you agree with that comparison @Cameron Kim said? "Morning to you all "@Sindiswa Moolman nobody - they have property rights unlike Kings who do not give property rights like in black Tribes and Kingdoms "@Felix Muyoba you said it was an unfair comparison @Thando Nkutha Nah - Agrizzi is corrupt. That would be more of the same. Booysen I can agree with. Mine is in jail @Cameron Kim. I heard he may be pardoned very soon "why Zulu king in particular?? There are so many kings in South Africa "This criminality is so pervasive Aren't the Zulu kings the most powerful in SA? 
1:43:53,1:46:31, @Vuyelwa Schrooders yes there are 7 Kings and all get government money Is the one jail also getting money @Cameron Kim? "I don't know about powerful @Sindiswa Moolman Will the Zula King vote for a Venda without Government grants ? And on tax money...our blood and sweat @Sindiswa Moolman So you can not answer the question - Gaatvol with so much unemployment in in our country Ya... @Cameron Kim. I can’t answer any of the king related Qs. I inherited this system 
1:46:44,1:50:06, @Vuyelwa Schrooders because the colonialist are moving factories away - no more foreign income = ZIMBABWE @Sindiswa Moolman hmmmmm yes - Black Volkstate and Kingdoms "Go to KZN and see the abject poverty why should we maintain his 12 wives and 50 children?? @Vuyelwa Schrooders dont warry - The Swazi King is over 50 wives We are maintaining his entire household and he insists on getting more I don't mind traditional leaders getting stipends for their work but the Zulu king does absolutely nothing for the country I SEE NOBODY CAN HAVE AN INTELLIGENT CONVERSATION WITH ME ' "our tax money is abused left and right. It's like we dnt have any say over anything 
1:50:43,1:55:41, @Cameron Kim We bow to your superior intellect. Say is again @Vuyelwa Schrooders Instead he charges his subjects more tax. @Magda Sequin @Derek Main thank you - but see the level of education ( see 30 %) pass rate also It's like tapping blood out if a stone yet his 'subject's are ready to take up arms for him @Sindiswa Moolman @Sindiswa Moolman 50 5 correct - more tax - more money printing = hippo inflation = Zim Nathi my bro @Musa Bakiti when the EFf runs out of money - how much will tax increase and the ZAR depreciated ? Guess you guys must buy the nice western things now "ANC ministers are cowards

Yes @makhosi nobhatyi My birth and his attorneys have concrete evidence *Myburgh 
2:00:59,2:03:17, "@Musa Bakiti is it nice living in cloud cuckoo land @Musa Bakiti when are you going to your Black Volkstaat and King with many wives? In all of this the ANC has no shame and remains arrogant what is the name of the advocate questioning Booysen? Her surname is September "DCJ Irregular expenditure must be recovered from the minister if not regularized. Processes were not followed. 😀😀😀 @mvubu1234 she is still young but I think she has will make it

DCJ don't start again "@magda Seguin we want him to go Response The judge is not well bantu @Musa Bakiti and @Lisanda04 😂😂😂 I can't believe how the entire ANC close ranks and protect each other...honour amongst thieves @Sindiswa Moolman I have all the sympathy with the Judge @felix we have earphones some us ang that cough. huuu wee

Lucky that the Judge has a long weekend to recuperate Sangoma are at work DCJ watch out @Philani Madlala hau Zondo must get some meds @Philani Madlala why dont you want to give her a change - it takes years to become a Gerrie Nel or Barry Roux - 30 years 
2:05:50,2:08:39, @Musa Bakiti kikikiki @Sindiswa Moolman. Tea break was 1115Hours She will get a chance dealing divorce cases. This case is of a national importance She is spoiling our appetite shame @Philani Madlala why her particularly on divroce cases? learned persons are assumed to have sharp minds but the question is are they all having sharp minds? "I have already explained y "Adv September take change please September please ask for a break and go home same time we tired of you 
2:09:41,2:14:27, May be she needs a smoke break @Philani Madlala seems you have an issue with this advocate..did she reject your advances or what? "It is time that the NPA "Just listen she apologizes the whole day @Philani Madlala do you think she can do divorce cases according to indigenous law ( Tribal Law) or constitutional law? "The Sunday Times ruined this man's career She won’t be on live tv at least Sunday times must be close That rag is a disgrace 
2:14:53,2:19:59, And the editor didn't even check the facts wish every one the best long weekend.Please drink and smoke South Africa is not free. Sometimes these editors fall in between conflicts and taking side effects and go ahead with wrong information seems they are bribed hahahaha You too Musi Bakiti I THINK THE WESTERN LAW AS PRACTICED IN SA IS WAY OUT OF TOUCH FOR IMPLEMENTATION - TRIBAL LAW LOOKS LIKE THE FUTURE FOR SA kentucky Cato Manor squad massacred black people!! it is now difficult to follow the story..too much digression 
2:20:45,2:23:13, listen to the person and let investigation be carried @Sthakathi Khumalo Were they criminals? Were they resisting arrest? "@Sthakathi Khumalo  "Derek Main Whether criminal or not "@Sthakathi Khumalo If they are trying to kill you THE PROBLEM IN SA IS THE DIFFERENT LEGAL LAWS. IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE- An eye for an eye @Cameron Kim Why you shouting? Calm down. This is the same Booysen who took a helicopter to congratulate police for killing Ndimande 
2:23:14,2:25:16, The kings in S. A dnt care. about the well-being of their South Africa is a lawless country @Derek Main take more puffs on the dagga zol Thanks @Albert Noah. Was in a meeting. Eish I missed a lot of his testimony "But then again guys what's happening i just tuned in? South Africa became lawless in 1994 @Derek Main are you under tribal law of Constitution law @Cameron Kim OK - don't mind if I do. 
2:25:21,2:28:40, The state captured had him arrested on false charges 90% of the polimen in duty dont know the basics of their job "the kings careless about the well-being of their subjects Just like the nurses @digitalemotionfilms that is the duty of the police today - they are a joke @Sthakathi Khumalo It is alleged he killed Lieutenant-Colonel Concho Derek Main But that goes to the rot of the legal system.. imagine having an alleged fraudster running a bank for example.. Eish... these people. Was it necessary to arrest him in his office? Surely they tipped the media’s well 
2:28:42,2:30:55, @Sindiswa Moolman Yes - that is the Tribal way Mzilikazi Wa Afrika and Hoffstaeter should be jailed for complicity and accessories This was just how a take down of a suspect who is known for violence.. @Sthakathi Khumalo I don't want to give the impression I condone extra-judicial killings. That is such a murky story though. @Sthakathi Khumalo It may well have been that this story was to discredit Booysen as we have heard of other such cases. fraudsters have been running a bank the VBS that is why there is the PIC Enquiry @Sthakathi Khumalo Yes this man killed many people he is a racists Zuma's evil tentacles spread very deep Kim you are a true Mareta 
2:31:19,2:33:18, The black police are racist that is why they set Booysen up. @Michael Wild Kim is best ignored. Derek Main How then do you explain someone taking a helicopter to go congratulate a police team for shooting a black man Magojela Ndimande.? who was not resisting arrest infront of people "Can we now trust NPA Val it's not about Race. but criminals The Scorpions were the best I agree @Michael Wild "yoooo @Sthakathi Khumalo I don't know that he went to congratulate them - he may have gone to investigate circumstances. The fact that he went in a helicopter is irrelevant. 
2:33:27,2:35:57, The current police cannot organize a picnic inside a pick and pay Yhooo @Thembani Billy Ntuli @Val Speirs And that statement is inherently racist. most his staff where black and he calls them friends if you been listening. he was the only white. and they respected him. Do be it When I read the truth a few years ago of how it was set up in Noseweek including the Sunday Times false publication I knew it was a conspiracy "Derek Main Fair enough Do be it . .l am a self confessed Realist ha ha 
2:36:09,2:37:55, "@Sthakathi Khumalo I agree - I hold no candle for Booysen. If he is guilty of a crime What’s the latest on Jiba’s case in the Concourt?? President is going to fire Jiba and mrwebi soon Jiba is going to jsil Jiba and Mwrebi are not fit to be in the NPA it's with CR he is applying his small mind Jail @Sindiswa Moolman Great - let's wait until then. I will be watching it... 
2:38:46,2:40:06, "I like Ramaphosa using courts and commission to fire people @Derek Main lol small mind...how come in that head😂 They used fake photos Really this guy was a target for refusing to sign off the 10 million Edward Zuma wanted from the KZN police It is so disgusting what they did to this man for doing his job well ANC - Huge fat corrupt looters @makhosi nobhatyi until someone implicates CR read his book - its shocking Where have you been @Eslon Eslon?
