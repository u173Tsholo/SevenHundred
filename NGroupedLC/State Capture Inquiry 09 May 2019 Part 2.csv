time,16:01,message DA all the way viva DA viva eff this commission is mathematically challenged it appears ü§£ @Petrus Mthimkhulu true 2 decimal places means your figure has two numbers after the decimal sign. The last number is affected by whether the third number is below or above the number 5. @watson mutanga true and i dont whay they are struggling about the witness is also confusing the chair 
19:35,30:09, 2 decimal places..that is simple then..69.98 will automatically be 70 When working with Mr Peter Volmink I found him to be a man of high morale principles Felix it rounds off to 70 only if the 69.98? and third decimal place is over 5 then it becomes 70. @Lorna Kavanagh yeah but in that case there was no third digit ... then it stays as .69.8 and cannot change to .70 no but then nobody can qualify..use your discretion that it should rather rounded to whole number.. the gentleman says it has to be 3 decimal points to change @Lorna Kavanagh the one who used that criteria was wrong..he/she was suppoed to mean rounding to the whole number and not decimal digits 69.98 is already in two decimal place format. It becomes 70 after its converted to a whole number. 
31:45,40:53, .... but they require it to be 3 decimal points @Lorna Kavanagh that was wrong or it is an exclusion tactic the authors of those regulations are incompetent eff all the way it is their regulations (government) that it be done thus... it makes a big difference when talking about billions of ramd. the problem will be that those regulations can be challenged in a court of law and that will cost government more billions instead does anyone want to play a game of minecraft WE DEMAND FOR A RE-RUN if the contract/tender states 3 decimall points then courts will stand by that. 
42:06,51:25, @Felix Muyoba --- don't u mean cost tax payers more money? @Lorna Kavanagh but you are missing the point..the issue here is the whole number which should be the score and not decimal numbers.. hi Felix i am going by what this gentleman said to the commission. "if you keep on hunting for the 3rd now i see..so brian was there when these confusing criteria were in place? "@Terencd Caldwell i mean that if regulation for tendering are not crafted properly Mr Volmink is one of a few people within Public Sector Procurement that understands the complexity of the numerous ambiguous pieces of legislation @Ashney Chetty i agree with you 
51:56,1:04:18, Mr Volmink is providing an invaluable service to this Commission "@Felix Muyoba - the point is that the government doesn‚Äôt own the revenues it collects. It‚Äôs from taxpayers @watson mutanga i understand Has the ANC won the elections ? it is the arrogance of mr molefe (brian) that motivated him to take that decision instead of using the legal opinion of the group.. "the people have spoken I am really trying to understand the gentlemen with powder milk hair testimony and its contribution to the commission... @Sthakathi Khumalo üòÇüòÇüòÇ @DavidMiles no genocide?? 
1:05:28,1:14:29, Obviously "@watson mutanga true Was this a FAIR election? Whats your take on this ? "Malema sings ""kiss the Boer's "" The world sees what's happening.." uh uh judge. stop manipulating @Stephan Dolk leave our judge alone please @Stephan Dolk - how is the judge doing that? i also dont understand what @Stephan Dolk is talking about the judge "what's the use no one will be accountable for corruption 
1:14:59,1:23:08, your mike dcj Kheshani what socks do you smoke? Whites control president selection? Do you not see the black president we currently have? Stop blaming whites for everything. Research Africa's history it was the Africans that captured Africans and sold them to slaves traders "Indd Lloyd You don‚Äôt know politics shut up. If blacks are truly in control and able to have free reign of their countries there wouldn‚Äôt be 8% of the population that owns 94% of the land. Please shut UP! Research The Arab slave trade. Arabs and the African slave trade lasted 13 centuries long before the Europeans arrived and lasted from the 7th century to 1960s. "@Khensani Rose: are the Guptas white? If you continue complaining about being disadvantaged "Oh come on 
1:23:12,1:26:25, Read a history book. Preferable one that is NOT written by a racist! Why is there a black president if whites control it all? How does that work? Can`t we just have Molefe come answer to this?? The only people that have truly advanced in AZANIA under ‚Äúblack presidents‚Äù have been whitest. "It's ironic that you accuse others of racism yet you display blatant racism yourself Khensani Rose You remind me of Moises Machel!! "A ""white black"" now? hahahaha" "Rose is a closet racist Blacks under the feet of whites?! CYRIL IS IN THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE. 
1:26:46,1:28:43, "Let me guess afternoon all.who is this guy and designation? He is Colonel Sanders @Lloyd Langenhoven you guys are happy when anc wins because you know that what they were evangelising about land expropriation was just a rhetoric..it will be business as usual.. lol "Inequality exists in every society This is the Guy that applied for a GCE posiion and lost to Molefe thanks Any white person living in South Africa and comfortable with 92% of the original habitants current conditions are the racist. Closet and openly. 
1:28:59,1:35:15, 92% of what? "Also Rose are you Khoi or San. Or do you know how to grow food that can keep the ground you have beneficial TO THE ENTIRE COUNTRY? If not..Don't claim. Powder Milk hair is saying Molefe awarded contracts unlawfully.. Can Khensani Rose tell us what the source of her 92% claim is? ANC itself doesn't even have land audit stats but Rose magically has them Anyways - I'm waiting for Rose to tell us how whites control the voting and appointment of the President. She turned to the wrong page in her EFF book - that's why she shouted out 92%. "Page 12 chapter 2 
1:35:35,1:37:18, Brian Molefe should bring back our money @makhosi nobhatyi yes @Lloyd Langenhoven can you guys refrain from this racial issues..they are pathetic! "No I cannot. Rose started this debate. thank you Felix I'm just testing her racist views "and the money he earned as a salary.when he started working there he already had alteria motives 
1:37:34,1:40:34, "But lets not pretend the entitity of Africa is..""'Rose""..It is not." "all illegally gained assets by all found guilty It would seem that black apon black capture has not changed. That is the reason Africa is slow to progress. Why is there a state capture Inquiry? is sa under state capture? @Val Speirs can you focus on non racial issues please? Try focusing on what is being said at fhe Commission. "Free advice to all South-Africans.... Truth has no color  "Keep your distance from people who only speak words of hate sorry guys i havent been in the country for 3 years now 
1:40:40,1:49:28, "@Ben Cole yes..tell them (@Lloyd Langenhoven Felix I just urge you to research The Arab Slave Trade by David Gakunzi. I was shocked. @Val Speirs yes but what will it help us? Well it helped me to understand how Africans were Muslimised and that this took place for 1300 years. I will leave it at that. You keep voting for the anc that does not do anything for you Powder Milk is bitter suka!! Well. That's very NICE? "Eddy Simelane @Menghai Mohali
