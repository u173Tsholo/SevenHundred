Perhaps if she just bit the bullet and didn't react SABC is like that one special uncle which we all have Adv September & Adv Norman are both not Zondo’s favorites "@Mangalani Mangalani I think Adv Norman gets nervous and starts bumbling when Zondo criticises her. If he didn't do that shes so hot wow @welton paulse The Uncle that we wish we never had
