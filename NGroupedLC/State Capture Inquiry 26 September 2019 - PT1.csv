If you argue with a fool people will not know the difference. even the poor whites houses were palaces viva eff viva let's stick to the point zplease1 amandla no coloured ppl are not coz it only gave electricity to the few durr 
28:47,33:01, what does cln Naidoo want to hide? Is it his identity or the information from the public domain? Nawu umhlola Jan go back to Holland naidoo is a crook of note its Ace how about we all advance a name of who naidoo is lol Why are they wasting time. What is this argument about????????? can someone tell me Hi youtube troll Jan van der Merve @ Gee Peex1.. yes i agree that's also my conclusion.. 
33:10,35:19, Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo is in witness protection. He is the whistleblower who supplied info to the investigators 😂shem @Jan Van der Merwe he was going to testify on camera jan u miss ur women not being exposed to real men "from what I see  don't you guys get tired of this bickering shoo "naidoo's face is on google This witness has to be protected. It is his location that is secret is this Kevin bra for real 
35:20,37:23, salmaan generalise why don't you I'm targeting jan andre They will kill him if they find him Is Naidoo trying to hide his identity or the information he has to give? @Jane - IN camera Are we not a multi racial society No dought I want to show him his view is not reflective of many whites You look a like 
37:31,45:18, All the corrupt cops lawyers fighting not to have him testify "Eish someone email the picture to the witness "Ok thank you and please sit down Moses Sandile bloody agents How can you capture the department that safeguard the country from wrong doing f007? 😀 and X would be better 
45:48,49:56, I am agent F08 pronounced fok8 I have special cover secret agents have no demeanor cagey is not a demeanor it's a state guarded secret what going on we need a non-verbal analyst to evaluate demeanour like when your eyes shift to the left - it means you are lying the liars in this commission talk a lot and then change their story we've seen quite a few no names - no packdrill 
50:12,52:30, All politicians are liers @Yin Yang what is a demeanor in China??? I agree Gert. every single one of them I'm a politician - in camera 😀 Greetings from Poland 👤✌💯 Colonel Dhanajaya Naidoo we see you on Google. @Yin Yang was just asking gershin but people won't be paid off they use Google 
53:28,58:18, all the implicated persons!!! their lawyers are in a queue.... This is a waste of time and money no they need a 3d model the live person and a generic sample A picture should be sufficient. IF you did read the book animal farm you will know from where the country come and where is it going I agree Tebogo it's as effective as the Mugabe funeral @Gee Peex1 easy to find. I would have changed my surname to something like Govender or Moodley @Yin Yang I like Chinees and i even like chinees Food eg SSUUSSHHII """I think he would be aware of the application"" please get him in to confirm this" 
58:21,1:02:53, 🐟 they should be digital These people are insisting on seeing this witness in person so that they can bring their sniper to the location. whats going on are they planning to invade Japan? hong kong goes to show once you taste western freedom you wont want to lose it "no Shaun21  they stormed their parliament with a british flag ... nuff said this Naidoo seems to waist our time and money everyday the commission charges us why is he so important babadi tlatsane implicated supra who is alleged to have ordered a hit on Bozwane murder. following the proceedings ! 
1:03:00,1:06:10, THEY STORMED THEIR PARLIAMENT WITH A BRITISH FLAG a testament to western freedoms erm... that's because that was their flag for the past 100 years... making the Union Jack the symbol of Western democracy is a stretch is this guy serious right now the British flag is subject to royal rule What a lot of nonsense about very little ! Just don’t show him in camera and no pictures in the media """in camera"" a term that means two different thing in court" the british flag represented the freedoms the British left them with in their constitution when they gave hong kong back to its people Eish Naidoo my bra 
1:06:31,1:08:33, On the other hand people should have to be held to account when they make statements """in camera"" English means there's a camera in the room. ""in camera"" Latin means in private which means no camera" that's what I call my car scared my bra won't live long.🤣🤣🤣 🚗 🤣🤣🤣🤣😚 😂😂 You should be scared @Lorraine Naidoo. #I'mstaying 
1:09:00,1:10:18, 那个国家 No words for what’s going down today at the Commission . Why was this not thrashed out in Chambers ? yay! 非洲那个国家？ Lorraine he's safe as houses there are so many Naidoos and Zondos in KZN... maybe This Colonel Naidoo is Lorraine Naidoo. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Just kidding not my Bra .to many Naidoo in this country's "Perhaps she must see Naidoo to put a spel apon him 
1:11:06,1:15:19, Beginning to believe this Commission is merely a venue to make payments to Judge and Advocates ! "Naidoo  He sounds foreigners They want him out of the safe place I tell you. Snipers are ready and waiting. Crooks this is a waste of bandwidth and tax money "What kind of tie is the opposing Advocate wearing  Andr'e for sure I don't think he should have worn it with a white shirt Jasper🤣🤣 Ffs I think they are trying to bore us to death today ! 
1:15:43,1:17:59, Very boring If you showed us Zuma then show us everyone.who is greater than Zuma Transparency and Openness is the hallmark of our Democracy. Zuma is the Boss The judge should not allow cover-ups. Really what is the point of this and why are they taking SS long to make i it ! Madonsela talks for too long. Agrizzi costed South Africa human life. Beginning to think Zondo likes the sound of his own voice 
1:18:04,1:22:54, Zuma was president. Even if they didn't show him everyone would know who he is. This Naidoo guy is in witness protection for a reason. "This should have been fought out in Chambers  Madonsela must just sit down. He reminds me of Zuma's legal team Is this a debating Venue ? "Think the public should now be invited to take part  "Sorry guys Agrizzi is a sellout Now I understand why cases take for ages and some witnesses die or disappear. What a wast of time this morning has been! Sort out these issues in Chamber and give the summary to the commission? Thanks @I Am Free 
1:24:25,1:30:07, @JFK In the spirit of transparency this is very much appreciated....We would be complaining about deals done in secret had this been done in chambers. In future when Dr’s determine if a patient is dead they just need to play this Commissions findings and see if they elicit any response ! No need for a heart beat ! they will always hide evidence and some important information from us as public "@Siyabonga Dladla Thanks My will to live is quietly draining away NOOoooooo! "They must give out Public warnings that listening to Commissions are or is very bad for one’s health  "I think some attorneys just grandstand here for fame and fortune? No arrests Lol 
1:30:15,1:36:55, Zondo mist resign we need a fresh new judge And that had nothing to do with the State Capture commision. "You know I think that in future they must pay the public to listen to this crap  They must all take pension nor wonder there is a lot of youth unemployment these people stay in positions so long like Mgabes "No Alright I’ll listen a bit more and be entertained by all you lovely people interacting here today But I still think they must give Public Warnings aboutlistening to this rubbish being detrimental to our health Zondo is now eating a full meal Their objective here today is to talk us to death via humongous boredom 
1:38:40,1:45:11, "Why Why Why ? That is the question  Beki Cele must come clean Why Zondo iz not under witness protection ????????????? "Wish I could give an order  How many a Commission ever resulted in Court action against guilty persons ? I’m watching this from the UK "Cele There is much that is wrong in ZA and UK at the moment Who has got it worse do you think ? 
1:45:34,1:50:56, Lol I would like this State Capture Commission to Tackle the Bio-Ethanol Plant in Bothaville! This was also a looting vehicle! "I love South Africans  "I apologize for my existence  "@jasper dougal In our loveliness and kindness Yes always rotten apples every where "Femicide is your great problem  The sad thing about SA is that we are not at War. ZA people ugh better looking though 
1:51:32,2:02:48, i dont think its a wasted effort by having this comission look at the people that are involved in this corruption if this was not in public we would not have known anything even though we know we will still vote them back into power "Think that’s a bit unfair  Courts and Commissions always want to put off tomorrow what they could deal with today Enjoy engaging with everyone here your so much fun lol @Gee Peex1 i hope they start putting those people that are implicated into jail as way of a example so that others will get the message loud nd clear whos that pet monkey ZZZzzzzzzzzzzz 
2:03:30,2:07:53, as far as i no yes shes still working there hah ha ha "Why Zimbabweans come to this country do illegal mining? Whereas there is mines also in Zimbabwe "Judge Zondo’s deep voice could be used in meditation  Hi Nice to have you here Why they break our laws then @ Gee Peex should we fight about people who are here illegally? if we were friends with these guys eish we wud have been rich without consequenses(dreams) if we were friends with these guys eish we wud have been rich without consequenses(dreams) 
2:09:18,2:17:00, "We must fight this authorities to do their jobs by applying laws whoever came here must have proper documentation This is a sign of a functional democracy. @ Gee Peex1 I don’t have problems for them to come here but follow rules and regulations that is all. They must mobilize themselves to fight inequality and fight government whose failing You know immigration is going to be a huge problem when Climate Change drives waterless people to new places "hi all Mr Naidoo @ Gee Peex they used Zimbabweans to paint the picture of bad Damadt and Maluleke as a get away to fire them because they feel threatened by their investigation they do "If we could only get people to integrate and learn about the Culture of the Counrty they want to settle in  "They must also learn some of the people language  
2:17:52,2:22:06, at once stage was the most beautiful cou rty Ethiopia is experiencing huge tourist interest now "@Gee Peex have you ever go to Zim? nothing has changed there accept that Mugabe took the nation since 1980 nothing changed city still the same  our next president???? 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I can not say Mugabe is a hero he killed people who against him and no money there Ace going to be the next president 😂😂😂😂 "I think we should give up on Democracy  "Time for Revolution I think  @ Gee Peex my problem I have is their presidents relaxing when the people of their own country go out because of hunger look for green pasture now they are too vocal to blame this country
