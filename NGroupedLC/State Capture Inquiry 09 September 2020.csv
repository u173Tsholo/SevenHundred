""".. I don't recall.."" is the new ""I don't know...""" 
28:19,31:43, anc takes us 4 granted/ @Ndumieh Mokoena Eskom did not raise funds but donated money from the company's bank account. very tru Salome anc takes our money too "He is in the mood the Chair l morning Nobhatyi BUT YET WE STILL VOTE ANC????

"The whole ANC is a mafia gangstars So much outside interference in ESKOM. No wonder it is a BIG MESS today...It was just a money pot for looters!!!!! This country is set up in a way that looting is the only way to live decent life masquerading as freedom fighters 
36:02,38:47, "and you won't see ANC protesting racism coz they knew how high the probability of racism would be against black people when they made vague and untrasparent deals with abacindezeli  Tsotsi is singing like Canary 😂🤣 "Hey buti yeyona inzima "the rot is too deep @Thabo Mokoaleli Let him sing.... how you know?@Residentc and how deep? feel us in. Ace Magashule and Nomvula Mokonyane must wear orange outfit For what Thabo 
39:13,41:22, @Thabo Mokoaleli Why? @Salome Seabe we are happy that you've repented. We hope you'll be able to influence repentance of many ANC voters. Power to you 😃✊🏽 @Thabo don't forget Zuma @Carmen James his sing because his lawyers told him the Guptas are gone my friend save yourself @Garth lol true Mark my words it will happen @Garth Muller The Commission needs to know what went down......All this interference by compromised politicians and their enablers....Ridiculous!!!! Of course Zuma is Grand Mafia of the nexus:goodvibes: @Gala watch how Nomvula is also going to try save herself this afternoon lol 
41:27,43:56, The Guptas will be collected dont worry...let's finish off those that were involved with them @Thabo Mokoaleli .....What a crook!!!! RSA is a constitutional democracy people don't wear orange outfits because you dislike them. There is process and that process must be afforded to everyone e-respective of your view "Salim Essa the zuptas are gone....no one in this saga will ever be in orange overalls @Carmen James its going to be a long night for me in NZ i only get three hours sleep lol people that were fit to be directors were worked out/fired and the thieves stayed behind the canary will sing today... This September is going to bring most of the culprits in jail. lt might be this week from what I sense. 
44:11,46:27, @Garth Nomvula will also blame Watson since he knows he's no more Zola was part of the problem and he lying this is a Mafia's games I dont trust this Tsotsi @Thabo Mokoaleli you watch movies too much Theres no way the Guptas will Dodge the law...the interpol will bring them back...that will be after all their associates are dealt with I trust this man he is talking the truth "his name first""Tsotsi""you can hear" yaa his name is tsotswi thwiiii 
46:45,48:13, l think it comes from what I experienced in life. You can be surprised what l went through in my life tsotsi ya nnete nothing will happen here and no one will be arrested Lebitso leme ke seroma🤣😂🤷 kids education oversea medical treatment oversea H2O Perrier after they announce a recession yes dear @Thabo Mokoaleli I say this because it appears you have already concluded the outcomes of the commission. You seem to know who is guilty and who innocent with no court process. Guilty e-respective When is this government going to pressurize Dubai to handover those economic thungs to us State capture must also call witnesses for Covid'19 funds..R500b in 3 months.🙆🏼‍♀️..where was finance minister.?.where was treasure.?.where was president.?...we want to know..siyafa indlala 
48:22,51:54, "the chair is very energetic today Rita it is very clear that Zuma allowed them in "if nothing will happen from this commission's report I don't need a Court to know who is guilty "@Gala defintely they will kiss state power goodbye The should be results out of this Commission @Thabo Mokoaleli how does the process of finding someone guilty work in this country? It would be nice to read about the life of the guptas hey 🤔 @Gala anything except Anc will be fine 
51:58,55:55, I think president Ramaphosa was supposed to change the cabinet before When is Nick Linnell appearing before the Commission???? "The people he works with now "The big project was @Thabo Mokoaleli perhaps you should assist the commission and provide evidence since you know who is guilty. I presume you have evidence for your guilty verdict. @Thobani i believe in future they will make blockbuster movies about these stories we are hearing here.... Guptas will have their movie as well. its a matter of time Nick Linnell big fixer....He needs to SING!!! "@Akhonamandla Gala @Gala an @Seabi whatever happens after this commission the EFF wants to All S.O.E Nationalised so can you imagine what is going to happen then trillions will go missing then and Cry the beloved SA 
56:43,1:02:06, spurios charges. force people to settle out of court. make the board weaker by appointing our accomplices. @Gala away with nationalisation. that wont work.it will do more harm than all thecorruptions combined "@Thobani they will do a thorough research and all "@Akhonamandla "lol but i didn't promote nationalization.... i believe our constitution is fine the way it is "lol @Thobani the film industry @Akhonamandla 😂🤣 Eish ja neh The mood of Mr Tsotsi today is down.what happened to this madala :buffering: 
1:02:24,1:07:35, @Akhonamandla 'Ja neh' stands in the stead of 'wow' today 🤣😂😅 @Thobani i just hope they will use our south African actors in those movies instead of abo Danzel. we want magubane to act Zumas role "True Mr TSOTSI was conflicted between towing the party line and being ethical. He appears weak @Thobani aka Mr Wow also known as Mr Jah neh @Moeli mayby he received some troublesome calls after his evidence yesterday @Bongiwe i agree That is true "Tsotsi @Akhonamandla How much say do we actually hold on how they choose their actors and paint the story? 🤣 He'd fit to play that part but I never heard him speak English on set 
1:08:11,1:14:07, the Z83 form is useless guys they have lists no CVS needed @Mokoena agreed @MOKOENA Z83 is for poor people to apply in government "Wow He is struggling.. Z83 is maby for the unconnected people 🤣 but why are they forcing pple to use it z83 form "Believe me This is getting confusing. the list was supposedly 'imposed' by the minister when he is Chairman of the Board. no COB would have allowed that 
1:14:08,1:18:06, The big Gns uses the smal guns to loot the state. It sad😓😓😓😓 the chair knows all who r guilty already. that I agree "I don't know how many times I applied using that form last year psssh just a waste of time..... fo sho u need an ANC membership with an inside connection "but the NPA is slow the Chair haven't gathered all the facts yet so how does he know who is guilty? It is a collective effort and everyone in the ANC knows what is going on. My humble opinion. some evidence are irrebutable Minister Brown is throwing Mr Tsotsi under the bus about the proposed list of Board members Z83 was long scrapped. lt is no longer in existence 
1:18:42,1:23:08, "if u hear the chair saying it is strange that's true "If he says its strange :goodvibes: mna nje ngizibonela umdlalo wokuxhaphaza abantu nemali kunikwa omakama ngeminwe kulebhilidi labo elibizayo..amaGupta ayedlimali kwa'Eskom kodwa besingakaze sihlale ngomnyama njengoba kwenzeka manje judge zondo you continue turning the screw slowly Best is when the chair laughs with/at the witness/accused 🤣 Masala you are in the deep problem Wy this things not happening under Mr Mbekis time 
1:23:28,1:29:18, Reality is that party politics in this country will always trump justice. Eskom - SAA - SA Express - Transnet - Petro SA and numerous other SOE's and their Executive will never face justice Never EVER Mbeki's leadership was right Yazi lana it's just a drama of showing the World how stupid nd puppetic are these ppl..Y they didn't want state capture to start frm 1990..it's bcoz they don't want ppl to see how they were stealing Mbeki was trying his best @Alpheas thanks u answer me no more Question now Zuma was allowing every body to steal and help them Justice - Accountability and Democracy are Western concepts forced on Africa by colonialists - We need to understand this @Owen Nyilika..it was happening but they didn't want it to go there bcoz it has got big guns. ok. now he is telling the truth 
1:30:33,1:34:21, Make no mistake this Commission knows what their doing. They only gather material evidence. the truth shall set you free All evidence is recorded. the Guptas are everywhere 👏👏 A sitting President SOLD the country to the Guptas.....The Guptas had a ravenous appetite. Today they are sitting pretty with the stolen monies while our Country bleeds!!!!!!! thechair is anouncing his verdict on the gupas now @Akhonamandla Thabo Mbeki shied away from the apartheid prosecutions and in my view he gave a safe space for many evils that we're suffering in the present day go go mr zondo. that was the whole project in the main this commission started long time ago and there are no arrests have have took place... it's just a waste of time and money. 
1:35:02,1:37:44, the chair is issuing his preliminary findings now "The day I see an implicated minister go to jail We don't need to play a race issue here. There facts are bare what about the Seriti commission take place under Mbeki yoh amagupta and these useless guys no one will be arrested and jailed it is just a waste of public monies Seriti commision was a fus.somebody must be liable for the millions used in the seriti commision black professionals were the target of guptas and zuma Gigaba also corrupt but we need to look him in between the lines 
1:37:56,1:40:30, "If the Chairperson Zondo was white True Thabo @ Akhonamandla : under the leadership of the mbeki. He was president best president in the history SA in growing the economy. race card used to divert questions about corruption is so criminal mbeki wanted to rule until the return of christ Seriti gets his share and misinformation findings I wish Mbeki could come back Mbeki had his fair chance either not a Saint. mbeki helped disband the Scorpions!!! 
1:41:03,1:42:07, "if mbeki comes back mbeki killed people with his policy on HIV!! an economist at heart mbeki commited genocide mbeki protected Jackie Selebi "Mbeki was against disband of scorpion @ Phakamile. remember Thabo mbeki fired Zuma for the corrupt relationship with Sabier shake. in mbeki economy was growing mbeki shirt 
1:42:14,1:50:37, Holmes what Zuma did? Mbeki wanted to separate State from the party politics. "I really dotn have patience for this Evidence leader "no comrade go read chronology I love this sound Zondo makes either before or during question or comment. Do yal know what sound Im talking about "Brown just sent SMS @Salome. Did you know under mbeki Leadership. we are only African country who has perment seat @ G8 @Michael Holmes Mbeki asked for a week or two ensure that there is stability in police before head of police was arrested. No evidence showed him saying the then head if police shouldnt be prosicute. But still that is tantamount to interference in the affairs of another sphere of government ... 
1:50:45,2:06:40, Mandela did not finish his term handed it to mbeki n took over also his 2 terms mbeki wanted 2 centers of powers as if he's the only leader. I am so greatful I was never in Mbekis shoes. You have Priorities Crime (Scorpions) fighting with SAPS. Then where is effective policing when you have two police bodies fighting against each other? "Cyril is bringing back scorpion "Let's see  "Gupta's has to sign off first @Thami & Lonwabo..you know Y Cyril wants to bring back scorpions it's bcoz they're in the same WhatsApp group all serving wmc dat's Y their corruption is not exposed or it is said in a gud way @Phakamile Khuzwayo..K..economy was growing what different did you see as an ordinary citizen compared to Zuma's tenure. "Ndlela "There is poor understanding of public service 
2:07:01,2:11:06, @Thami I didn't not say he's not member of ANC..look at this political there're two groups one serving wmc nd the other who doesn't not want them. Further you propagate tribalistic sydrome "He is the face of ANC enca live "Scorpion was task to investigate high profile cases such as illicit drugs @thami das Y you saw some whites say let's vote for ANC it is bcoz they new our puppet is in he'll bring us back to honey world of gvmnt tenders. sry by saying whites not that iam recist by hey it's not easy to accept facts @Thami my brother you don't real follow our politics..if you do you should know what iam talking about..da man is de to fight for those who owns him meaning da hands dat feeds him Your politics are shallow and ill informed also sow division in the party. 
2:11:25,2:14:31, Your assertion is an insult to ANC and its members I thought this guy was only going to be in the hot seat for 45mins today there were 7 presidential candidates so we have to scrutinize all of the donor's to be open Hahaha @Thami Ngwenya I thought you were me for a second there when I saw your name... @Thami das how it is ryt now..it's out there but media don't say it out.. CR'17 bribed a lot of ppl das Y he doesn't want those statements to seen..ANC is divided anyway. This evidence leader is on stride Is it me or we have glitch today? Vote no confidence? "Can or should the Afrikaan Union get involved? S.A. EFF is the best hope for a better South Afrika for all Afrikan worldwide. Forward to a United States of Afrika. Dishonest 
2:16:02,2:28:06, these guys cant do anything and lie under oath brilliant leader @Thami..does Y he wrote da letter nd sent it to the media instead of going straight to the NEC..coz he doesn't have enough support in the NEC..you can't tell me about ANC you lacking a lot You lacking spelling Same problems in America; capitalism is parasitic eco-politico system; it's obsolete & must be transformed. "If the NEC does not support him "Thanks lol whos playing with the like/dislike buttons 🤣 Capitalist die hard! Revolution is the only solution! Zuma cost this country. let me remind you about the nuclear deal thanks to the former Minister Nene for refusing with his signature
