45:03,46:30, @Lorraine Naidoo Please name a university which accepts a person with a 30% mark. yes @Tshepo i usually ignore such baseless comments I've never heard of a country that has rejected a S.An. qualification. In fact this country is one of the best globally especially when it comes to research. "@Lorraine Naidoo This is their way of ""Correcting pains of the past"" meanwhile they invaded on mass scale Zuma kzn Zuma was caught with 440 Million in Nkandla of Gadaffi and nothing happened to him. Black Corruption taking place. Viewing now we have to pay the NHI @Anne M. I would also love to know the answer to your question. It is really idiotic for people to believe and share that 30% gets someone into university 
46:58,47:48, Kashmir is burning plz help us "@Lorraine Naidoo They won't get anything from me "ok morning all  Pastor J some people are beyond being educated because of their prejudice "@goolamv ""Fake News"" by the way @Phindile i guess its only their imaginary countries "@Pastor J Yip @goolamv Case is still pending once again.

The assumption is the that the next step is university @Mzalwane verylong indeed wrong choice Mr Thabethe to choose SA then Brazil "the 30% joke @Christopher Eddy Indeed correct @Ntokozo Madonsela He was thinking of the kids who were at school. Corruption and looting needs to be eliminated along with direct arrests for the daily Riots. Wow his taking the Premiere part @Viewing do you have facts to support your statement? 
50:14,51:15, Mzala so true but looking@ him now I'm outside the country and where i am people have to go back to Uni .Because they don't except degrees from SA don't remember @Ntokozo Madonsela With hindsight. "@Phindile Ntombela It took a majority vote to enable it to drop from 50% to 30%. and yes "i also believe that this state capture will also go to the private sector "Jacob Zuma is here "@Phindile Ntombela In other countries they will never accept anyone with a ""Degree"" that they got with the help of BEE." guys do you want us to live stream all state capture events? 
51:34,53:03, I have 2 Degrees with UWC but I can't get employed because my degrees are withheld as I owe outstanding fees & employers want the degrees before employment. Are there any donors who can bail assist? mornig everyone Tshepo Selepe does it matter?? Are you black? He is well trained by Public protector It does Jeffrey?

Goolam I won't wast my data soon Ramasunga? what kind of SA black is that from? @pieter Du Plessis stop spewing racism man 
54:33,55:56, No racism go back to school Jeffery this is South Africa wait for white people to hear your pain and they will rescue you 🙄 @Isaaco Mhlongo Are you braindead or brainwashed? nothing said was racist. Isaaco Mhlongo not once have i refer to race @Daud Musa Race Card lol. Typical. 😎😎😎 Ace in the hole😎😎😎 My sound is in Afrikaans please help more woes for the pp for this estina thing she was ordered by the high Court to pay 7.5 percent of theach DA and Casac 
56:54,58:47, Ms Gcabashe is thorough. I cant believe that all this gentlemen and ladies were part of the state capture. @viewing Marikàna race card Loool @Daud Musa No race card was used. You use it though. the pp is not compent. Looks like there was a collective accounting officer concept? So ANC like! Bedazzled : from Limpopo Diana Sekatane understatement 
59:38,1:01:49, When it comes to ANC and EFF. It's Everything for free. Ramaphosa could not pay his card to be a President but white people assisted him and Jeffery it's hope they will help you too """We want free water and sewage and Electricity in Port Elizabeth""-Land Grabbers." EFF is the ANCYL. Anc now officially disbanded the other fake lot in the ANC. @Daud Musa Lol another Race Card. @Cerebis Two parties filled with criminals lol They use to raid each others villages and steal cattle and women.Its in there DNA "He just have to tell it like it is  All of Kashmir is India's 
1:01:58,1:04:03, "Oh my "@pieter Du Plessis Indeed Pakistan leave Kashmir @viewing when it comes to crying of the poor of the continent it is race card justice for Balochistan Free Balochistan "@Martin De Beer Sigh "@Thando Nkutha  India and Pakistan are one Nation. The British divide them very successfully. Thats why politicians get away with the stuff they do. They work to make/keep us divided and fighting among ourselves.... 
1:04:28,1:08:49, Our leaders acts stupid because we are all poor and this education of a white man does not help much @Daud Musa More race card excuses. You're a simple racist at heart. Daud blocked The Land issues is more important than this stupid inquiry He was the head of agriculture actually Legotla and Bosberaad just means one thing: Party time Bru "ha ha @Daud Musa There is no land issue. Go work and pay for it like all of us. @whitepope5 BEE can be blamed. 
1:09:09,1:11:15, @ Viewing agree100% Management 101 lesson here? @Viewing BEE <> RET (corruption campaign of ANC) "@pieter Du Plessis Indeed mate SC Norman will expose you. I love how thorough she becomes when she asks questions. "@Greg Rowles Also it was planned with SACP as well that's true many young people are job less becouse of poor government 👌 This Lady Adv will take no nonsense from this guy! 
1:11:40,1:15:15, @ Daud Musa work for it "@Daud Musa We as Whites built everything "RET is a corruption campaign @whitepope5 - the facts you are divulging are too much for the ignorant and weak minded. @Daud Musa Lets use your crime rate for example. its tea time guys. I have better things to do Pieter where in Amsterdam are you based? Education received in SA before 94 is generally recognised internationally. SA had one of the highest levels of education in the world. Since 94 their has been no control on the quality of education. 
1:15:20,1:21:10, "In fact @whitepope5 - self-imprisonment is deadly. Majority of our populace are in self-imposed confinement. The tragedy is: they do not realise that fact. Black sons eat or you will be eaten hi Afco join AWB then you will make sense South Africa is overpopulated and undereducated; hmmm we have overpopulation for the size of our economy "@whitepope5 and the question has to be """"what has the ANC government done to eliminate these issues""""? The answer is NOTHING because they are too busy stealing from these very people." 
1:21:18,1:35:01, "not enough education you're also a racist is the show over? If you don't like it here you are free to leave. Trump will welcome you to his stolen land "@Daud Musa when you got nothing better to add to the discussion "i won't though our economy is shrinking; ppl demand jobs; the govt wants to strip the rights off land ownership; businesses will get smaller along with our incomes "we have over population for the scale of our economy; we don't have enough businesses popping up The show has resumed 
1:35:37,1:41:02, Corruption everywhere 🤔 The prime reason the African continent is a failure. @goolamv 'Mkhwebane must pay 7.5% of the costs of the DA and 7.5% of the costs of Casac in her personal capacity' (News24). I guess that makes 85% from PP Office and those 2 sums of 7.5% for her. Anybody there? please sir meri request hai ki aap Kashmir par bhi baat Karen please aap apni Aankhein kholen aur Kashmir par Baat Karen please meri aap se request hai ki aap Deccan India wahan par kya zulum kar raha hai Eish Indian language. I don't understand. @goolamv Thanks for raising that question it got me curious.
