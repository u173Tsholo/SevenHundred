17:47,19:44, Elson MEC FOR sport NW brother of Steve kompela "Elson Fulani ewe MEC yho Ku bird "@Michael Michael Pleasure i wish i had balls like Agrizzi i would expose all cheating married men🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂 
20:12,22:11, Wow Cedric Frolick....Buti Kompela.....the list is too long! Do the ANC have a breeding program to produce all these corrupt people? Gavin Watson clever one hi how r u Musa stupid at the same time I'm voting EFF! not because they are innocent themselves but because the ANC is disgusting "@Elson elson Buti Kompela MyANC So Gavin Watson never put his signature on any of the Bosasa documents while he was the CEO? can we please see people getting arrested already...🙄 
22:14,24:48, Vividly seem to be the word What was Gavin Watson's position at Bosasa ?? @Michael Michael no stupid can create such net of criminals but now he is exposed he never signed anything. the gentleman is clever that Man is very clever but he appears in everything Morning morning @mphumudzeni siphuma the people he worked with were very stupid..i could have said my friend you sign for it yourself 
24:53,25:47, morning luks No one is going to get arrested. You must remember that the president is also implicated in all this. Mornings Peeps Directly or indirectly This inquiry exposes how stupid we black people are when it comes to choose leaders Off the topic Hlaudi Lyle Motsoeneng is really crazy "Buti Kompela is a former police Felix is easy wn the boss says it goes @Nthabiseng Malebo how is the president implicated 
25:50,27:17, Hlaudi is an attention seeker he held manifesto speech under a tree "@felix muyoba remember they were benefitting as well Hlaudi needs a reality show @Michael Michael i agree with you but thats the mistake we (as subordinates) do..just because someone is a boss I don't think they will be charged (the people that came to the commission). Zondo express his concern regarding Agrizzi's arrest yesterday. He said that it will discourage people to spill the beans you can't trust Hlaudi That guy makes me laugh @Shark boi Smith @mphumudzeni siphuma true 
27:19,28:34, Smith puppet reality show.think he can go to Chester ANC is corrupt people "they are creedy and just wanna in richs themself and family The whole NEC got GW purses MR Pistorious is very strong he stand by his own feet for the entire day Hlaudi should become the president! Of the tea club at Pollsmoor prison. Felix there's culture in our country u stand for the boss.ur family gonna suffer ANC are thieves Hlaudi should grow an afro 
28:41,31:15, "lets offramp for a minute.since the beginning of the commission @Michael Michael agree Hlaudi is a comedic genius "Ntabiseng Malebo he is launching his manifesto "@mphumudzeni siphuma you will never know hey @makhosi nobhatyi he hasn’t changed anyone’s life for the better Cedric now Cedric James Frolick as well? Did bossasa have airport contracts too ? 
31:22,32:40, Cedric also had a GW purse "Shark boi Smith the man is sick Mr Agrizzi always offered more water bottles than any witness. Have u ever heard Vincent Smith on eskom equity.he is honest. @Shark boi Smith Somebody at ACSA was also getting money At all the airports "Yes Will Gavin Watson ever come to testify? ANC + Bosassa= corruption everywhere 
32:42,33:58, @Marvel Ramatshela Agrizzi even drinks fancy water Carrick Frolick was Parliament Chair *Cedric Gavin Watson long time runs Elson like it or not he will @Eslon Eslon An innocent person would be beating down the commission door. ANC scared of GAvin Watson his testimony will kill ANC point blank The corruption ran deep into parliamentary corridors "Agrizzi. Grizzly Bear 
33:58,35:27, yes "Goole ""Cedric Frolick"" and see all his doings." "I never and stillThe whole ANC is corrupt. But then again I wonder if they bought Chicci Watson's Springbok caps Cheeky Watson....from the anti apartheid hero rugby player.....to this??? @Cerebis YES!! i want nothing to do with ANC Cheeky refused to accept a Springbok place 👀 
35:45,37:26, Cyril is just so skelm .he never knows anything everyone got paid but him vividly vividly vividly i remember kkkk Let me remind u wt u Baba said.he said u want commision u will regret again he said he know they are stealing and he keep quiet. true @ Michael "Remember what President said What about what he stole himself?Zuma is the Chief Thief David myb but he must also appear to clear his name. david jacobs what can Cyril do if he does not know 
37:33,38:22, @makhosi nobhatyi cyril is also part and parcel to this corruption Magda agree Yes Makhosi. And he said that boldly. @Michael Michael that tell you that he is the architecture of state capture @Phillip Moshapo i dont believe Cyril Ramaphosa is not innocent too.lets give mangosuthu buthelezi for presidency so because people were claiming that Zuma is the who is the most corrupt in the ANC what will happen about the current president since he was implicated ?? David's let's prove it @Phillip Moshapo ...SPOT ON....They are ALL involved. 
38:26,40:02, Watson Criminal Enterprise....Hope Puke Luke Watson is not involved??? "After apartheid Cyril must take andile to police station Ngomane pricely But he is Isihlahla. @Isihlahla Samabhinca how is the current president implicated Is Andile found guilty of any court of the law. Referring money to Rubbish..wow "@Cerebis I have just read. He was selected for Jnr Springbok 
40:08,41:04, Now South Africa has two Presidents Mboweni and Ramaphosa @carnoth ngomane i mean his son is... if you fight corruption corruption fights you back.were did south Africa gp wrong @ Davids Jacobs what did Ramaphosa steal? Did you hear his name appeared here? He explained about R500 000 so I don’t think he is part of this state capture and he is been investigated Andile should be subpeonaed @makhosi nobhatyi As long as he's not expecting forgiveness. All these criminals must serve time. @Isihlahla Samabhinca yes his son not him The ANC anti CR faction is trying to frame him Thanks Madelein. Correction accepted. 
41:09,42:16, haaibo i'm late Magda like any other people Ramaphosa gave us the spin on the R500K - the real truth will come out soon. I'm surprised that Andile Ramaphosa is guilty of any crime for him be arrested what crime did he commit besides doing business with a registered company Bosasa "Cyril is not yet implicated All of ths thieves explain n get investigated until we all forget about their corruption @makhosi nobhatyi people yearn for Ramaphosa to be implicated at all cost ANC killed MAGAQA and that Mayor is walking free "We must look broadly what happened to Ramaphosa 
42:23,44:06, Ubaba wa Andile Andile should testify to clear his name if he was only in b @carnoth ngomane All ANC MPs are implicated - they protected Zuma for years. Manase myb someone like Dudu gonna mention him I think Cyril panicked when the Bosasa payment was brought in parliament. He lied blindly. @Ntombethemba Manase - Cyril received contributions from them for his election? The interesting question is - Did he ask for if? Or did they just give it? Who is Njenje? "@Derek Main not all of them Pooh Derick again 
44:27,45:02, ngubani ngk njenje dilute my whiteness mara Agrizzi "Sometimes i feel this oldman Agrizzi is lying "People just wish Ramaphosa to be implicated which is not going to hear @carnoth ngomane Tell me which ones didn't protect Zuma. Apparently he never requested money...it was offered by Watson to his son...could have been a setup.Remember it happened just before the ANC Nasrec conference..The ANC wanted NDZ to win Put Agrizzi on a government payroll 😂😂😂 "prison is for the poor who dont have resources to shoot back Sibanda he is ryt 
45:04,46:41, @Madelein Huxtable i think theres more to come out of that story all anc ministers @Magda Seguin - thanks CR is a billionaire...he didn't need the money for a campaign It's a pity he's going to jail still. No pardon for corruption @carnoth ngomane - think so The guy likes nice food. 38 government official are implicated "@Derek Main is nkosazana dlamini zuma implicated 
46:53,47:56, don't play with agrizzi 😂😂 He should be sharing a cell with JZ and most of ANC "Anyone can be shocked asked about Bosasa knowing you have nothing to do with them CJ Zondo was surprised that one of dept of justice official was named there as corrupt "@Thando Nkutha they all going down.. they will go to jail when juju becomes a president Froulick DA 😳🤪🤪🤪 Bribery in parliament? Don't they have no respect? 
48:32,49:16, @Marvel Ramatshela if they give him a tough sentence we wont have any whistle blowers coming out and will never find out about all the underground corruption 🤔 "Angelo Agrizzi will never lie Gibson Njeje - Former National Intelligence Agency head Gibson Njenje . . We are not safe "Agrizzi "@Ntombethemba Manase and thats why lots of people hate him "Agrizzi is ""Julius"" and Watson is ""JZ""" Angelo ALWAYS offers info. Even when not asked😂😂 
49:17,50:35, @Magda it is not financially prudent to spend your own funds on something like a campaign. balume Agrizzi "mr Agrizzi is not playing games but let the government deal with this corrupt people finish and klaar "agrizzi doesnt even spice his stories  ayeye masutha Masutha😨😱 😂😂😂😂😂 this guy is very clever how you remember all of these things where happening woooow "@Lloyd - you are right. But the problem is these folks will keep doing it hoping to be pardoned for being a whistle blower 
50:46,52:13, Masutha is a crook also Agrizzi please stop now b4 mentioning my name 😃😃😀 take them all out agrizzi bolile yonke nje ANC apha lonto sisezova izonto ezininzi apha "masutha is my home poi Guys be carful before Agrizzi mentions your name 😃😃😀 Masutha🤦‍♀🤦‍♀ kid with new toys Agrizzi is very funny today... 
52:16,54:07, 😁 "Carnoth Thando big time.he never affected by midnight reshuffle 😂 kid with new toys Agrizizo "@Magda Seguin - Yes he is Gavin Watson was targeted ANC to destroy its government he is white pretending to be a member of the party 😳😳😳🤪 The whole Cabinet of JZ is corrupt to the core 700m taken from his department 
54:16,54:58, Politics and business is dangerous Masutha is soft-spoken for nothing. He is a crook like the rest of them. Kekana correct "Agrizzi is an eye opener spill the beans agrizzi "@makhosi nobhatyi i think its timeti start writting a book.the fall of ANC Masuthu refused to be corrupted. Skelem 
55:11,56:05, So Masuta turned them down "Agrizzi no use talking it's a waste ANC to corrupt no one will ever go to jail they look after each other from the president son will be pardoned The wrongdoers hate CR With fri accormodation Watson was a gangster... 😀 Just need one whistle blower from the ANC with Agrizzi they can tear the corrupt guys apart "Yep Caroth papa leshabani again 
56:13,58:43, Maffia.myb originally from Russia @Ntombethemba Manase he refused to sell his soul Dennis Bloem's testimony on the prisons exposed his colleagues big time "This people pretend to love ANC while driving the party to the bush Makhosi agree The Bosasa skeletons is too much @makhosi nobhatyi that can only happen if the ANC is really serious about cleaning up Masutha turned them down and then what? Did he report these guys? Anyone? I just wish the commission would make all the Crooks pay with an Orange suite 
59:27,1:01:23, Lamola he must come to clear his name @Pheladi Lamola .....report them to who exactly???? Agrizzi nearly died of heart attack He had a tumour on his heart Masutha wz aware he accommodated at Gavin house but he says opposite.he is a lair. You don't pull out a gun and don't use it tell them my Angelo this bosasa is the most dangerous poison to the south african citizens.... "Currently president is very serious about fighting corruption but it cannot be him alone as you see fight back "Pheladi maybe he did 
1:01:28,1:03:58, Dlalisa if u steal u dint stop until u get arrested His testimony is so colourful! He should really write a book @makhosi nobhatyi he certainly needs backup I don't know @Robert Russel. Gwede? Law enforcement? These people wanted to corrupt him. Mcebisi told his minister at the time. He didn't turn them down and left it at that. So who did Masutha tell? this man will not lie he got clemency Vincent Smith. Such a disappointment🤦‍♀ Did he say Magashule @Pheladi Lamola i think Masutha could be helpful on that regard All the details...yoh! 
1:04:02,1:05:13, @makhosi nobhatyi Ramaphosa should be marching his son to the police station right now if he were true to his word. "They failed to get Ramaphosa Magashule implicated @Pheladi Lamola .... all of the reporting channels were compromised by corruption.... just listen to the names being dropped...incl the ANC.... NEC "The NPA thought by arresting Angelo @Masina eish Vincent out of all the ppl Ace Magashule?? If that's the case Ntombethemba that'd be great. He must just come to the commission then and furnish us with his version. @Bridget I'm just hurt hey. 
1:05:21,1:06:39, Vincent brilliant boy "@Slindile Ngcobo I think its pretty useless if the same Person who appointed this commission is implicated  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace "No its not Ace Magashule Dennis Blown asked the Commission to investigate Vincent Smith's death.He thinks it was not an accident.Vincent Smith was totally against being bribed by Watson Ace Magashule is Estina farm who makes a claim on a person's life insurance while still alive??? Agrizzi must be highly protected. zmichael I miss that too 
1:06:40,1:07:16, "Yes I agree Pheladi @Michael 😂😂😂 criminals do. even his food "@RIFDA HERLANI 2014  Agrizzi now qualifies for military witness protection plan No Hatred against Angelo shall be tolerated today✋  Mashaba" Please block this movie troll "Derek main young boy didn’t do anything wrong

1:14:37,1:15:55, MAGAGULA! Guys Gillingham again who is Magagula Yandi not sure between the ten @makhosi nobhatyi It is very clear that the entire ANC knew that Bosasa was corrupt because they were all getting paid bribes. "Gillingham is out on bail Yah. Who is magagula this man took records of every single detail of what happened in his life @funicanz crush on me please 
1:15:58,1:17:04, Lets Vote ANC out of power So there’ll be a deal for gillingham too? Nomvula Mokonyane ready to testify at Zondo commission on state capture "@funicanz - If he is seen with black people @mphumudzeni siphuma .... you've just made my day. Needed a replacement. Gama no ways.wn a kid fail in ur house though them out of the house big no. Nomvula wants to question Agrizzi "Derek main poor boy was doing business with chinise company Dahua which introduced him to Bosasa just to do job b4 he gets contract at east Africa Agrizzi is that uncle who'll tell you who's your real father without alcohol encouragement. 
1:17:18,1:17:54, She is welcome @Talloolah Moon Should only be if he voluntarily comes to the Commission How much money has been recovered by ANC from corruption I doubt Gillingham will get a deal...no reason as he is totally implicated...I will research what are his exact charges @funicaz remember this might be the beginning of ur 26 years marriage 😁 Talking about food again Thanks "@Mzalwane Mzala she's trying to settle the dust 
1:18:22,1:19:24, @Afika Centane You can get fooled by the spin but most thinking SAfns know the truth. It's become all to clear with these commissions. All ANC MPs (incl Ramaphosa) are corrupt to the core. crushing on you Jewel Did ya'll see Nomvula's Tweets? 😱 She's gonna be honest!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂 Timeslive reports that Mokonyane will testify at the commission of inquiry and it was also her intention to cross-examine witnesses. @ayanda🤣🤣🤣🤣 I dont trust this dude Nomvulas said she will protect Zuma with her buttocks...what is there to live about her? Lets vote them all out -to show them that we have the power Ephraim u mean Agrizzi?? 
1:19:28,1:20:32, rohan barnyard 😂😂😂😂😂😂 lewel where are you @Nkosinathi Gama Back that brooooo @rohan barnard ha aha hahahahahaah Can they put his Agrizzi's testimony online? @Nkosinathi Gama vote for who? Nomvula Mokonyane Is just gonna feed us with lies🤥 @makhosi nobhatyi His father probably suggested it - he knew Bosasa was the ANC's cash cow. kante where is this Garvin Wadson? 
1:20:42,1:22:16, He is the only honest witness so far @Derek Main you are generalizing yes most mp's are corrupt not all of them and you cant prove that "@mzalwana mzala Nomvula is going to lies loudly All the commission's videos are on Youtube "@Sipho Sepale  No one is challenging him.look at hw many names he give @Sipho gone to oversea @carnoth ngomane I can prove it - check which MPs voted to protect Zuma - ALL the ANC MPs did - they are all corrupt. There's always 2 sides of the story @Michael Michael 
1:22:28,1:23:35, Derrick again always out of line really?? vote Cyril Ramaphosa @funicanz is he behind bars or hes just chilling nje? Bring the anc mps Ephraim agree.they must come put their stories @Derek Main and the same mps forced him to resign remember? l cant wait to c Nomvula in orange overalls "The US authorities now involved lewel im crushing on you 
1:23:41,1:24:57, Derek main Andile he will answer this by himself when time comes me and you I see we are in aboxing game politics not looking at problems without mixing this commision is useless..the government wont do anything about it Agrizzi has photographic memory if he is not making up this stuff. I would wait for cross-examination Remember Agrizzi testified that the tenders specifications was drawn up by Gillingham and Smith...Watson and both of them should be arrested on that evidence alone Lewele Jeremiah why would you respect a criminal? AGRIZZI RECALLS EVERYTHING VIVIDLY 😎😎😎😎😎😎 "@kekana @Lewele we will take to the street He remembers his fod 
1:24:59,1:25:45, food @carnoth ngomane Yes - they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to come to that decision. They could see the anger of all SAfns and had to act eventually. "Molweni Agrizzi has a LOT of material evidence it make sense that is the reason this country is broke Judge Zondo has got an amzing voice. so dignified Ramaphosa is weak he should release a book. i think i would buy it Ye. Makes sense 
1:25:53,1:26:37, "That is true Jeremiah there is no one who will go to jail Barry White Agrizzi knew that this day will come Yes llyod zama you have missed nothing VIVIDLY Lloyd 🤗 Money gives you power Garven Watson Did as that to poor ANC leaders he is weak he cant takes bribe. @mugonori pleasure thanks 
1:26:59,1:27:45, May be Watson is in Dubai sipping juice with the Guptas 🤣🤣 Babe wamaNames those implicated going to make a big mistake appearing at the commission proclaiming their innocence. I sure AA has proof and is waiting for formal denials name them all wena Agrizzi "@Derek Main everything has its own time period and remember the decision to oust him wasnt unanimous Zama uya zama Agrizzi knew that time like this will come it may be thrown to him as he sign and other coz Gavin Watson doesn’t signs showing that all he was going to do was to put all blame those who signed Fact is @Innocent...it was taxpayers money and the ANC knew it angelo remembers too much...... 
1:27:48,1:29:16, anyone got pics if Guptas/Watsons/Zumas? If so gameover! I wonder what gavin is thinking or even feeling right now having to wake up to a show about you. and nomvula Yes Ramaphosa is very weak because he never agreed to be corrupted. Ramaphosa knows very well that if he touches corruption he will be tainting with ANC primary policy if it was not true there would be a line at the police station laying charges against him for telling lies and defamation of character. so think about that. Check on Google...lots of photos of Zuma with Watson..even Zumas birthday cake had Bosasa logos on Fakazi incorrect i fear for Ramaphosa "@Sthembelo 
1:29:19,1:30:50, Game over SA is sick of the whole economic landscape pre 1994 and currently "@Magda Seguin - Yes Ramaphosa must prove me wrong Michael "@makhosi nobhatyi yes and somehow this bosasa debacle seem to be well orchestrated Y "They also paid for the birthday parties "someone mentioned that jonas started this "@Magda funerals too 
1:30:51,1:33:00, the ANC is corrupt to the core....period All that apart from the bribes "Mr Ramaphosa finds this ANC blondes with corruption so he waits pretend that he is with them "hold on a sec voluntarily we need a new government in power...the ANC is failing Agrizzi is talking like a baby🤣🤣🤣 oh am graduating guys...i feel like i need Agrizzi memory to pass my Honours degree this year It's nonsense that Jonas started the Commission...this is a direct result of the Madonsela report calling for a commission of enquiry..The EFF lied saying they called for it 
1:33:12,1:34:04, congrats sipho I can't wait to see what Cyril will do about implicated members after elections Philani like a baby k His guilty as as much as all the people he has mentioned so far...he knows that and says so as well ..every opportunity he gets ...he says his guilty @Sthembelo Majola thank you Agrizzi my man...expose them all "@majola He must be pardon 
1:34:07,1:35:08, "@Magda Seguin  eff Even if Agrizzi is guilty I don’t see the need for him to be jailed Illegal transfer of money overseas...it amounts to billions out of SA...this is just an example "Carnoth ngomane he keeps because he wants to be a state witness coz he has courage to do so He is helping the commision lock him up yes @Philani Madlala why?

My advise is that we should not get married to political parties. we should list our expectations to any we vote for and if they do not deliver we change our vote to someone else. 
2:05:28,2:06:52, Guptor in onether form @carnoth ngomane Yes you could ask that. I don't mind if people vote for any political party after giving it some thought.

2:23:08,2:24:24, Has the ANC granted the leave to cross-examine Agrizzi? Without Agrizzi state capture inquiry was impossible 🙏👊 ?m8o @Derek Main i hope you wont find it stupid for people to vote EFF in to power Mr Watson you have held that Agrizzi still has insider "Can someone help me understand "They can't stop Agrizzi from testifying Mr Ramathlodi's testimonyvwas extremely emotional...he exposed Zuma's charachter completely and hiw he operates with no respect for his office and the country @carnoth ngomane No I don't - they have not been in power so I don't know how they will behave. I do know exactly how the ANC behaves - pure corruption. 
2:24:42,2:25:48, Agrizzi was the strategical mastermind.....he knew the moves well...D @Ntombethemba Manase the ANC has made application to the commission to cross examine Agrizzi He decided to come clean after he resigned and had the near death condition No money to pay for sound technicians. Just bear it Malema is the ANC . He said is blood is green and gold. "pre payment is stealing Sabc all money stolwen BALUME AGRIZZI BALUME 
2:25:51,2:27:03, Agrizzi proved Guptas to be interns in capturing the state. This is the real state capture. So as things appear ANC is sponsoring itself through corruption @Vongani Maluleke Well said Is ENCA having same problem SABC ...WHAT disappointment Agrizzi said when he was discharged from hospital he decided together with his family to expose Bosasa vuvuzela Agrizzi l like u "@Derek Main the main riddle is Is Agrizzi an SA citizen? dont leave anything Agrizzi 
2:27:21,2:27:40, @carnoth ngomane It's obvious to everyone else. @Masewawatla Masewawatlasethe i guess so but of italian descent The state must give this guy impunity for being a crucial whistle blower at the state capture commission really How come he doesnt have Afrikaans accent?

It is just that we have not heard Gupta's Agrizzi. A person who was hands on. Otherwise the Guptas are worse. 
2:28:53,2:29:35, @carnoth ngomane So you're admitting they are being stupid if the man is actually killing them. Agrizzi has a nice house in Italia. italian mafia.... When is Gavin Watson appearing here I wonder? @Cerebis it should repossessed Bosasa=Italian Job "@Magda I think Mr Mti will come running to defend himself Holmes that us a known fact and he admits that.

2:31:51,2:32:14, @carnoth ngomane Being loyal to a political party is stupid. Especially if that party is not acting in your best interests. It's not rocket science. "@Dimakatso When he says that AGrizzis statement yesterday.......when we speaking of loaves of bread......we ment bricks of money.......kkkk Zond😂o😂😂 Mr Zondo cant stop loughing 😂😂😂 I love Raymond zondo Deputy Chief Justice 🤣🤣🤣🤣 "Adriaan Basson exposed all the ANC politicians 
2:32:17,2:33:03, zondo is laughing ...for his evidence he thought they were gold..agrizzi is also a serious criminal..if it was gold then he could have kept them or what? this is a lesson to all the corrupt members of the ANC Zondo enjoying every moment with Agrizzi "@Thando Nkutha He gave away the ""gold coins"" because they weren't gold its a movie Zkndo😂😂😂😂 Yes felix wouldnt you?

No EFF slander shall be tolerated today😈 
2:37:13,2:37:49, Agrizzi should be given the ANC candidate list for the 2019 election. He must then mark off all the people BOSASA gave 'handouts'. I think there will be hardly any name left not marked off. @Yandi Masina i cant wait for that to happen..some of us are wallowing in poverty and some are buying shoes for 19K? Will he be required to give up everything he gained from illegal activities? shoes and corruption glen agglioty bouth Mbeki size 6 Agrizzi naleSudu yake eyodwa mnxn I like Mr Zondo....he dont forget....nevet @Felix Muyoba in due time.

3:16:15,3:17:27, @funicanz At least other parties would be moving in the right direction - not making corruption worse like the ANC @Musa Bakiti so you cant start a business yourself Africa needs to wake up to what is really happening.

It is your right as a citizen. 
3:17:27,3:18:15, "@Isihlahla Samabhinca ..if Watson can be arrested THE ANC TOOK SA TO JUNK STATUS so Zuma has never worked with Bosasa ?? Higher powers will keep Africa primitive (fighting amongst stupid things like race). They know we have the best natural resources so keep us like this. Cheap resources. Cameron nope its the cabal "South Africa have to choose between the ANC and EFF "The credit for state capture inquiry goes the Thuli Madosela "Supra is now an elephant in the room Africa should stick together as a continent. 
3:18:34,3:19:07, Zuma and Bosasa/Gupta are thecsame whatsapp group That cannot happen as the higher powers will not like it Marvel Supra is now key player "agrizzy was in kimberley SA can't be a better country under the leadership of ANC @Precious Ntshangase you mean Zuma has file of the ANC seniors ??

All appearing are ANC members and i do not think they really needed this inquiry to take off but the courts forced them "@Isihlahla Samabhinca the ANC made South Africa - JUNK - status  JZ was head of intelligence one tweet and there would be mass suicide in the ANC SABC is trying to can this live broadcast... and we're awere. ba sa tlo re tena pls!!! Agrizzi is doing well now but imagine having him as your best friend and he goes to your missus😂 I don't understand how people can still trust in the ANC. They are not delivering on their promises. South Africa will never go back to an apartheid regime under white rule. Ppl need to not fear that. "@Isihlahla Samabhinca ...oh yes 
3:20:30,3:21:29, "Matthew @Evolving Humanity because voters have no idea why they are voting - CR needs strong mandate this election to clean ANC after May 8 "@Thando ANC under ThumaMIna is pro business not pro grassroots "Therefore no ANC member should get any credit for the establishment of the state capture inquiry They lived lavish with corrupted gains...even this singing bird no sympathy for him...but watch this government giving these ones a TRC pass. 🤔 I wonder how many ANC branches voted for the rotten apple list
