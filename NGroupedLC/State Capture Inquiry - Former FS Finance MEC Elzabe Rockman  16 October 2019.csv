time,6:26,message As we wait "With cost of this inquiry Zuma plot of load shedding stopping you soon "This is just a talk shop ON TIME !!! WOW !!! @Derrick saperstein ‚Äã With cost of this inquiry. Same but I am hping that the state will recover more than the cost. No talk shop. It casts sunlight on darkness where there was none. It prods our consciences to make better choices in future. It will in time lead to prosecutions. what new 
6:43,18:01, I think this commission should run permanently to name and shame all the corrupt cadres. There are so many people who have not come forward yet. I feel like this is dragging!!! when is state capture gonna finish? "@I am free @Zama Kubheka State capture and corruption will never stop as long as the ANC is on power. They are corrupt to the core. I don't think Ramaphosa's strategy of telling everyone what they want to hear is fooling anyone anymore. @I Am Free Those were pledges and they often don't materialise. You must ask how much of those investments went into Ramaphosa's pocket... but a few NPOs are NGOs Totally agree with you.. @ I am free 
19:04,21:32, Derek I hope that those pledges are incumbent on action on corruption @I Am Free ....you are still not free...hehehe "@I Am Free You may be right but I still think it's a semantics game he was playing. He said ""secured"" but that could still mean just a pledge." i decline. the fall of america private public property @Lady Bird You and me both. i decline Remember when Alexander riots were staged only for free ANC campaign program in the cry for help. Ramaphosa hasn't done any of the promises he promised those people. Very unfair. 
21:49,28:22, Is there not a clause in law where NO GOV OFFICIAL OR THEIR FAMILY should NOT benefit from gov. financially ? I mean come on There should be no way Gov .officials and their families that benefit from gov. grants and contracts LOL Wow BA languages on finance position @Thami Ngwenya Is that significant if she had 15yrs experience in the general area of governance? "Depends Did you know that all senior mangers of SOE must be cleared by the SSA...case in point Eskom has 121 such mangers..100 of them have revused to be vetted. The SOE have discretion to over look red flags what he did needs lifetime sentencing...he deserve it Robert Russell that is highly concerning 
28:38,34:19, hauweng!! "@Thami Ngwenya I see your point. I would suggest she understood the situation quite well but deliberately cooked the books Sounds like people with no qualifications Rob ... Yes FREE I am from RSA ...living in Israel The lady is just beating about the bush and playing safe. What can she do? "Iam not Jewish  lol your name LOL NP

Baningi abafundile but ignored ngoba bangama clever blacks I Am Free funny Icelanders dont think they are going extinct and there are only a few hundred thousand of them in the world lol But Jacob is a politician not an official "It's either the memory is still buffering or she's playing safe Last time SAA was run with a profit a Coloured Cheryl Carolus was in charge ...Last time gov ran a solvent budget with a surplus a Coloured was in charge Trevor Manual ....I see a trend here . Yes FREEE they are . LOL I can read Icelandic .Scary difficult that THAMI . Jacob is just a common criminal ... why support New age and left out community newspaper in the province to die.... 
43:16,45:17, newspapers under Free State Media Cooperative have all died due to this New Age paper who is this lady? Yes @ I Am Free Nobody ever remembers which Gupta brother was present. Why? But they let them call the shots Finance MEC Elzabee Rockman shot @Corl√© Jansen ....former Free State Finance MEC El-za-bee Rockman. They confused people for a reason @Pheladi Lamola. They never introduced themselves to anyone... so I heard. Have any of the Guptas ever appeared before this commission ? 
46:01,48:12, @I Am Free ....ppl in glass houses should not throw stones teeheee FREE . Is that so Sindiswa? Yhoo. They were very sly foxes those Guptas That‚Äôs body shaming @I Am Free "It's not shaming  this woman is not guilty.. Stoned people in glass houses....... @Pitso Mosetlhe That is so disgusting Pitso. The Free State lost historical prints? More than 20 Community newspapers all suffered a blow due to the New Age monopoly in the Free State 
48:26,50:26, remember the quote.....as dit pap reen moet jy skep...baie @I Am Free ....but you could be totally unfit... Mine included whats the topic today? "Iam still waiting for arrests from this very expensive commission  "@Lady Bird She is here for evidence I think Norman I am very smart . "lady bird there is never gonna be arrest "@Pitso Mosetlhe Hardy bra 
50:41,52:48, So this is a sham .Thats what I figured watching from Shanghai "@Lady Bird In that case the commission must conclude before proper prosecutions will start Lol hahah WONDERS has ended this is not a court of law its leading up to court cases and prosecutions new age junk mail.... can't call it a newspaper... rubbish..... hopefully 
52:58,58:37, "@JoziTube Maybe Jub-Jub should anchor it and be sold to Channel 157 ""Moja Love""...just asking?" @Pitso Mosetlhe was there no daily in the Free State as she claims? The SON newspaper is the worst..... fullstop @I Am Free how cool is it that the united states has frozen gupta assets and businesses in america "yes @ kapn Krunch it would be interesting to learn about OPPENHEIMERS as well as to how they also conduct business and negotiations "frebriry @Robert Russell We stocked this New Age rubbish and for 2 years we never sold 1 copy. I dont even recall our local fish & chips wrapping chips with it it was so bad. @GH MG Some of us say Febluwali.. each to his own 
59:02,1:00:33, david icke believes the royal family are flesh eating reptiles i mean do me a favour But this could've been discussed with everyone at the same time.

1:04:33,1:06:02, So you decided to be the capital for Guptas. We all know how Guptas never used their own money to pay for anything Nonsense but Piet Rampedi did in Limpompo Guptas were introduced to zuma by Mbeki who inherited them from Mandela.... why is the focus only on zuma Are these guys paid by the hour >>>? @Kapn Krunch The bible stories are about as credible as flesh eating reptiles. LOL Derek thats your opinion "This will be the fall of ANC "Nonsense. Why would the FS want an English Newspaper so desperately when the majority of the people in FS was Black and then Afrikaaners 
1:06:23,1:07:56, "@Derek Main‚Äã how did we come to bible stories? oh just clicked David Icke theories.....That dude will.make people nuts The whatabouting is not helping now @JoziTube. Money left our purse during the Zuma time.

1:08:34,1:09:59, I‚Äôm banking my money on Bathohi @Lady Bird. so @Sindiswa money did not leave during other peoples terms or it is not exposed? just asking because i dont believe corruption came with Zuma but the focus is on 1 Man Who is that Sindiswa ? @Lady Bird The problem we have in SA is the ANC. Get them out of power and maybe we stand a chance of recovering (if it's not too late). It NEED to be soon Derek .SOON @Derek Main u have a point. ANC is the problem @JoziTube I may introduce to my wife but I don‚Äôt make that for you to flirt with my wife why do we need government? Vaibhav Vijay Raut is a greedy dog.

"Uyaphendula uThixo ngoku ubuxoki buyavela kwaye izinto azifihlakali kude kuphele. Bebeba bagqibile bona kodwa inkosi yabuvelisa ukungcola kwabo "Wow

"Trump made decision on Gupta  US Congress made that decision not Trump @Easy D We can only hope. Better to have load shedding before we didn't even have that electricity But it is easy for a criminal to point fingers too . They have no consciense Who are the real share holders of Eskom .name them! Electricity was fine before 
2:08:55,2:12:07, "@nonhlanhla ntombela Seems to be the ANC strategy - if everyone doesn't have it @cupido jaftha ...Taxpayers What do you mean when you say before you mean before democracy Was gonna say that Slindile lol Yes why you must be the only one who have something others don't "@nonhlanhla ntombela So instead of striving for everyone having something PRIVATIZED ??? Yes lets give it to some compony of Patrice Motsepe and his sister @Academic Editors you speaking my language. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not that easy The only way to strive is to share 
2:12:30,2:14:40, First in line for tenders ANC members and their families @nonhlanhla ntombela Your share of nothing is still nothing. But some people they decided to have it all and left others with nothing LOL Truth Derek this lady is babbling it's obvious she was captured also.. NONHLANHLA those people are the ANC !! yah neh geld word ge eet myb but not only ANC and white monopoly capital who refuse to share what we have as a country "What a way to improve governance and leadership! If current newspapers are critical of your leadership 
2:18:12,2:25:08, ok If I can give you an empty shop n make sure that there is no way you can put stork on that shop would be able to run that shop n succeed "Media says cows are dying and the SPCA email saying there was no cause for concern "@nonhlanhla ntombela NONHLANHLA No you dont . What are you talking bout . Let a Somali show you how to do that shop thing babe Graphic design.... Evidence Leader enjoy listening to herself. "@nonhlanhla ntombela While I'm all for addressing the inequality issues we have What we see here is a form of job creation ... 
2:26:05,2:32:48, Derek I agree with you but you cannot do that if you are pulling in different directions "@nonhlanhla ntombela And until you realise that your ANC leaders are only interested in their own pockets Well said Derek "@nonhlanhla ntombela If you keep telling me that because of my skin colour Derek if you can't stop defending the sins of the past I will always call you name because you recognize what happen was wrong n try to fix if Zuma said this week he is selling his socks for money. Z Gumede last week said she's poorer than a church mouse. what an insult to the poverty stricken black south Africans. "@nonhlanhla ntombela I believe that we have an inequality problem - no matter what colour the rich happen to be. If we address it in that way "@nonhlanhla ntombela If you address it from a racist standpoint The Guptas only sin is to enter and disrupt the WMC turf and nothing else. OVER 70% of all government tenders are in the hands of WMC especiali multi million and billion rands of value. 
2:33:22,2:38:09, @Teboho Skofifi I like to see some proof of that before I believe it. I am not in racist thing I pass that stage long time ago .My point is let's agree that some people where the favourites before n try to fix that without putting racist n all that Derick do you know which company got green contract at SAA she knows its a disgrace that the americans had to tak action against these crooks who commited crime in SA while we sleep @nonhlanhla ntombela That some race groups were advantaged is common cause - that was the essence of apartheid afterall. I think many white SAfns wanted to address all the ills... Yep Jabu These people really behind laws americans don't work with public noice. we work with noice and diversions here in sa. nothing wil com to pass 
2:38:41,2:43:51, "@nonhlanhla ntombela ...but because they are now demonised That's what we need to fix for me no matter which race all have greedy person who only think for themselves "@nonhlanhla ntombela You can't tell people that they are not wanted @Derick Main did you say many white south Africans want to address the ills of Apartheid? That's the funniest thing I've heard in my life. @Thulani Bukani I'm saying there was a time when that was true - I don't think it is anymore. "we living in 3rd world @Thulani Bukani kahle bafo hahahaha The herrenvolkish tone in that statement "@Thulani Bukan I dont believe there was ever a time where whites would compromise their comfort and privilege in an attempt to fix the situation of the blacks. @Derek Main 
2:44:02,2:48:32, It dont help to complain bout past racism while being racist NOW But that's did happen to us we keep fighting we are here today only we asking is for those people who were lucky to benefit from that system to try and correct it somehow @Paul Buchel if your family hated the NP what did they do to show that? do you have a pic of your grand pa marching against Apartheid? NONHLANHLA .The people befitting NOW are BLACK and in power in the ANC Peolple of ALL races fought against Apartheid @I Am Free are you comparing the effects of BEE to the effects of Apartheid? I'm sure you're not my friend. lady bird you are talking about 20 years against more than 300 years you call that benefiting "@Thulani Bukani‚Äã guys corruption has no color nor does it have any race 
2:48:51,2:51:52, You not answering my question @Paul Buchel NONHLANHLA learn to keep accountable those who are in power now . You cant be such a stooge . How does protecting those who rob from you now help you ? Some were forced to and had no option= blacks and some did so because they knew it was wrong and had a option not to=whites @Lady Bird. What's you don't understand people don't want to be corrupt but the system force them because of some claws n rules that still exist from apartheid time "@James Godloza Godloza We know that however some need to reminding that they are beneficiaries of a murderous @Thulani Bukani Believe what you like - whatever I say won't change your view anyway. "@Thulani Bukani‚Äã NONHLANHLA ARE YOU INSANE ? They have the power to change it ! Lady bird once you call person a stooge to me you lack ideas to make me see your points do I don't argue with such person 
2:51:58,2:55:04, "Lady bird seems like you think after 1994  it is amazing that we have all these mechanisms in place but our country is sunk into depression Loadshedding started again today @Tebogo Makoro And the ANC intends correcting that by implementing Apartheid Ver 2.0 THATO How did Mptstepe get so rich ? LOL Do you rally wanna fix RSA ? Than dont protect the criminals "@Paul Buchel there was none from the white community. my assumption less than 10% of the South African white population. We're willing to put the jobs "if our economy grows by 1% There were Whites who died fighting Apartheid Got given shares by corrupt peeps to protect ur generational wealth in the form of BEE 
2:55:47,2:57:58, Neil Agget died fighting apartheid @Thulani Bukani It's attitudes like yours that cause more division - you must be ANC. You do realise that you are racist - the NP would be proud of you. "White ppl must just accept that apartheid was bad and that they benefited directly or indirectly does not matter @ Derek Main all info is available at National and provincial tenders databases. TEBOGO SKATTIE Prove it . HOW DID MOTSTEPE GET SO RICH @Teboho Skofifi What info? "@Thulani Bukani @Jabu Malinga The problem mfo is that many of them did not make the most of that opportunity!!! now they see every rich black person as a criminal or in gov...that's why they will never admit "pointing fingers won't help any of you 
2:58:03,3:00:21, change starts with you stop wanting to change others if you are still trapped in the error of apartheid @Lady Bird Are you crazy. Why must he prove anything. Don't you have google to research for yourself. Are you really so racist that you think no black person could become rich from hard work? @Jabu Malinga I have never denied that. Are you prepared to admit that what we have now discriminates unfairly against whites? @Lady Bird Do that work yourself boo boo! im not here to satisfy your lazy racist sponsored views! "Thanda another one blaming the past for problems now  @Derek Main info about companies who received tenders worth millions and billions of rands. Some of these companies have African names but the directors and shareholding is lilly white. Th white people who died fighting apartheid were enemies of white supremacists so they must not conveniently try to claim them now when they hated them with passion. "derek So this MEC was a Gupta appointee
