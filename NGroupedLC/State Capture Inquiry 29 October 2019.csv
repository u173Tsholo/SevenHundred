This man's surname is Pretorius. this guy must speak up we need to bring som guys out of retirement and who have emigrated to other countries to run Eskom. you cannot take a guy out of school really sound is too soft sounds the SAME we might now really find out why we getting Load shedding 
33:14,35:26, doubt the qualifications I don't think they wanted help to eat the money. "@Jabu Malinga I stand to be corrected "Times have changed @SABC Digital News Please check the sound level. Volume seems a bit low. Voluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuume is this not about EWN chanel @Jabu Malinga Agree - it should be all hands on deck to try and sort out the problem. "nope Dannie 
35:58,38:28, Can this guy maybe direct us to the saxonwold shebeen >? "@Danie Nilsen It's about TNA wow PEOPLE GET PAID TO BE ON FACE BOOK @Anne M. thank you i thought i heard that it was a media thing today it is Danni TNA compare Thabethe giberish yesterday to this guy today..night and day The New Age advertising maybe it is gupta owned? 
38:37,41:07, @He lives in you - you always have negative stories about white people being turned down. Stories that only yourself can confirm. Thabethe came to just talk nonsense to try and avoid responsibility. Im sure the chair has already made findings against him It was Gupta owned @Danie Nilsen lol WHY ADVERTISING FOR A POWER COMPANY THAT OWNS 98% of market share??? the guilty ones evidence is all over you compete with yourself money laundering between eskom and guptas is this abour apartheid? 
41:12,43:55, Volume please otherwise we will leave you for the loud ENCA. @Mikey Likesit Exactly my question. GUPTA FAMILY IS SANCTIONED Yup I WOULDN'T WANT OUR TREASURY AFTER ME Trump is the antichrist. THEY GET PAID WITH BRIBERY "Strategic Marketing Dept advertised special programmes. Eg The bulb swap programme (you could swap your normal bulb for efficiency bulbs) why on earth would Eskom need to advertise. They are the only service provider and electricity is an absolute need amongst all South Africans. 
44:04,45:01, It is a valid and necessary function @Jesse Mix FO to USA democrat The problem is the corruption which occured they all liers Jesus will defeat antichrist Trump and his space force. YUP... BUT WHO ELSE SANCTIONED THE GUPTA FAMILY?? The Advocate and witness look like they’re conversing between themselves. They’ve forgotten they need to massage the Chair’s ego every now and again. i am going over to ewn where you can hear "I myself 
46:08,48:00, TRUMP JUST DELETED THE KING OF ISIS i am thinking of sactioning this guys from ASIA u know them "shouldn't Eskom want us to use more elc to make more money. they work in reverse When the chair is happy with the evidence leader he keeps quite and listen more especially when the witness is not one of the implicated ones. Trump did 911. ASia?? no not TRUMP Bush "Ndivhuwo "The CIA said that they killed him ""in spite"" of Trump not because of Trump. They said Trumps actions in the past few weeks made the job harder and dangerous.Almost as if he didn't want him killed." 
48:34,49:38, i mean those guys who looted our Tax revenue bad audio "Anyways can they fix the volume? "Hamza @Hamza CIA did not "Trump is going to hear these words soon: ""YOU'RE FIRED!!!"" 🤣" Those were soldiers already captured and in Prison. Trump let them go. @Hamza CIA did not stop lying. 
49:54,51:52, DELETING GADAFI WAS A HUGE MISTAKE @Derek Main on the trol train again grow up derek do you believe that ISIS leader is really dead? Well the CIA and Military killed him not Trump. Trump was actually playing golf at the time. When Osama was killed at least Obama was in the control room. MOST LIKELY NOT hmmmmmm and OSAM? I mean OSAM BIN LADEN osam is dust by know marketing 101 lesson given 
51:56,53:40, yea OK 1ST TIME I HEARD BARRY WHITE TODAY... "Trump was shown a Call of Duty video his son also bite the dust are free from ISIS MAYBE "@Hamza You must have reference of what you discuss here THEY ARE COO COO FOR COCO PUFFS

BOKO HARAM are nearly defeted they are running like rabits YOU ARE CORRECT NO MORE NUCLEAR what about Alshabab 
57:04,58:54, BOKO IS IN NIGERIA? @Derek Main stop talking crap NUCLEAR REACTORS = GLOBAL WARMING Especially with someone as unstable as Trump being in charge of nuclear weapons. @Derek Main Theres no way the military and the CIA gave him real nuclear codes. They know he is not capable of that responsibility. HOW DARE YOU...YOUR TAKING MY CHILDHOOD NUCLEAR FALLOUT = BIRTH DEFECTS yes and others country around the nigerian borders HOW DARE YOU 
59:29,1:01:36, "@Danie Nilsen If you have something worth commenting on to say @Derek Main i just did learn to read @Danie Nilsen Not worth it - learn to debate. @Hamza I very much doubt that Trump is a mere puppet in the USA Whitehouse as you are insinuating I SAILED OVER FROM SWEDEN... HOW DARE YOU 75 YEARS OF NUCLEAR INEPTITUDE MADE US ALL SICK hey we have not been consulted nor were there any contracts entered into seeing that we have sponsored Eskom for years with bailouts "@Neil Fraser He is not a puppet of the white house. He 100% control the white house and the executive. However gotta role one up. brb 
1:01:40,1:04:53, @Derek Main to debate you is to come DOWN to your intelect and i am not in the mood for that Hope heaven is Happy for MAIMENE to comeback full time as a pastor The millitary and CIA are seperate from the white house adn @Danie Nilsen So lame - how old are you? @Derek Main to old for you to catch up @Danie Nilsen You can't even spell intellect 🤣 @Derek Main is it compulsary on this post to spell corectly "@Hamza Whether they trust him or not @Derek Main AND Danie Nilsen grow up guys

1:07:09,1:08:12, DOES ANYONE REALLY TRUST THEIR GOVERNMENT??? @Derek Main CIA is not the one that killed ISIS leader. "he wants said ""i want to make America great again""" @Buyani Mhlongo Where did I say that? I DON'T chair i need protection from the live chat @Derek Main. I've heard enough of your crap. I'm muting you @Simon Davies Great! THIS GUY HAS THE BEST VOICE 
1:08:39,1:10:27, Be nice to each other people. Peace. Love and Happiness SOUNDS SO MUCH LIKE BATRY WHITE Mikey!!!!!? Hello @Pastor J. I wondered if you were watching today. @Buyani Mhlongo Then who was it? The CIA obtained and confirmed the info (from the kurds and Turkey) then the Military carried out the operation. Trump wasn't even invited to watch in the control room YRS? @Pastor J trying to be but sometimes some people make it difficult ACCOUNTABILITY. CONTENTS KINDA SLOW BUT STILL ENTERTAINMENT 
1:10:30,1:12:01, @Anne M. I am always here My Dearest Friend Anne. I will miss you all too much otherwise. @Thando Nkutha Exactly - Trump is KKK. @Danie Nilsen Sometimes people lose the plot and become angry and intolerant of people they never ever met in their lives. That bad stuff brother mikey smelling blood DIDNT HE BLOW HIMSELF UP WILL YOU ATTEND THE 2020 TOKYO LEUKEMIA GAMES ? somma call tea "last week Russia said they development plan for Africa @Hamza read the news he was in the ops room and saw most of it and prepared the speech for the nation america is an inspiring nation and run by mostly competant people repuklicans 
1:12:02,1:14:37, Advocate Kate Hofmeyer is a brilliant lawyer. I CAN'T SMELL ANYTHING. I HAVE A COLD 😆 Adv Vae is coughing on the mic. @Danie Nilsen Trump was seen out playing gold at 3:30. Bagdadi was killed at 3. How was he middway through a golf game and in the control room at the same time???? @Hamza ask him MAYBE @Danie Nilsen Theres also tons of evidence to suggest that the picture of him in the control room was staged. The ethernet cables aren't even plugged in. @dANE @Hamza You're wasting your time - that's like trying to get the truth out of Trump. 
1:15:03,1:19:01, @Danie Nilsen You're the same as Zuma supporters who defend him even when all the evidence shows otherwise. Exactly the same. This just shows the idiocy has no race. @Hamza Yes - America have their own Zuma to deal with. I THONK TJAT APPLIES TO MOSTLY ALL PRESIDENTS @i am ocupied with the witnes so please chat to the rest on the chat about your hate for trump WHY HATE ANYONE? WHAT DOES IT SOLVE?? "Even the evasion tactics employed by trump are similar to Zuma's. The 'Whataboutism' THATS YOUR OPINION WHAT POLITICIAN DOESN'T DODGE THE TOTAL TRUTH 
1:19:22,1:22:13, That was supposed to be trumps entire MO I SEE MYSELF IN THE MIRROR 😆 @Thando Nkutha in a country that have more jobs than people to fill it made possable by republican gov compare it to us and the frogman "@Mikey Likesit What president has made over 13 Teabreak I'll have 2 sugars please. Thank you Exactly like Zuma supporters Same whatsapp group Why call him a racist when there are so many other things you can call trump out on that have been proven? @Mikey Likesit and all of them should be considered as bad presidents shpul 
1:23:19,1:27:29, WHEM YOU SAY HE...ARE YOU REFERRING TO ME?? that he doe not take his salary and does not make distinction about his countryma all in america is americans @Mikey Likesit I think he's referring to Trump. Did you guys know that Trumps dad financially supported the KKK and was actually arrested at one of their rallies? yeah he smoked too much weed that day 😃 or MAYBE NOY ENOUGH. LOL Trump victory 2020 "lol "Oh i guess we can just say that the Guptas and Zuma are innocent of corruption I doubt trump will even win the republican nomination 
1:27:47,1:28:50, Trump has guts and is able to take on the crooked establishment. MAYBE MAYBE NOT @Born free Trump is the establishment. oom witness maak net jou bek oop en judge jy kan ook maar @Born free 🤣 You've bought the BS hook-line-and-sinker. No doubt Trump will be victorious in 2020 His head of education supports cuts to public schools. Trump won't even get the nomination from his party. @Born free some intelegent people here 
1:29:09,1:31:01, HE HAS A SLIGHT LEAD? @Born free i agree with you Are you even following the impeachment proceedings? His own party is turning away from him because they can't disagree with the facts. You have no idea about American politics and the reptilian demonicrats How can you oppose Zuma and support Trump? - they are the same. YEAY...BARRY IS BACK... Derek there is no comparison and you know it. Zikhiphani la "@Born free Yes i do. My opinion is that they democrats are corrupt clowns. However 
1:31:18,1:33:34, Trump is winning Republicans are the silent majority as they were in 2016. "@Born free If I didn't think there was ZUMA IS A SMART MAN...LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK L0L """silent" Republicans didn't even win the majority vote in 2016??? They received less votes than Democrats. They won due to the undemocratic electorate college. You obviously don't know the facts of what you are speaking about. .MR ZONDO HAS THE SMOOTHEST VOICE ON EARTH They weren't even the majority in 2016 and that number has extremely declined since 2016. The Demonicrats are unbelievably crooked and this Investigation will turn on their heads and expose their Quid Quo Pro in 2016. QUESTUS QUIDEM.. Trump will get them and expose them . 
1:33:47,1:35:26, Lol you speak like trump Rubbish what rot Saying nothing with big words @Born free Have you got small hands? 🤣 WHAT POLITICIAN ISN'T AT LEAST A LITTLE CORRUPT ? Hamza ​Republicans didn't even win the majority vote in 2016??? They received less votes than Democrats. They won due to the undemocratic electorate college. And more didn't even vote!!! Watch some real news CNN are paid to spread the false narrative @Born free i hpe bill barr will open up a can of worms when his investigation comes out @Mikey Likesit All politicians are corrupt but Trump and Zuma have perfected it. 
1:36:01,1:38:17, CAN OF GUMMY WORMS ARE 😋 """Donald Trump - you're fired!"" 🤣" @Born free and Fox?? They are imparital? The same Fox that supported Bush when he lied about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction? (He has admitted this so don't try and deny it) HE ABSOLUTELY LIED Bill Barr has appointed Durham and he is investigating these matters. The Demonicrats are terrified of the truth and are desperately trying to impeach Trump so they can stop his investigation in 2016 Mikey i would imagine a dead one The same fox which Trumps ex press secretary works? Do you not see the conflict of interest / break of the seperation of powers? YUP. YOU ARE CORRECT... DEAD MAN TELL NO LIES Do you not see how that is similar if not worse than Zuma and ANN7? 
1:38:47,1:40:47, No there is no comparison at all. @Born free i do not think the demonratz will sucseed big mistake was to take the impeacment to closed doors and americans do not like it because it is not an clasified enquiry WORSE IS AN OPINION... MAYBE WORSE. MAYBE NOT Gigabite again I'm sorry but then you are an idiot. I guarantee you Zuma will say the exact same thing when on the stand about him and ANN7. "@Hamza @Born free ...May I ask RESPECTFULLY that we focus on SA and particularly the Inquiry. We are on the chat and we are being subjected to Trump @Hamza None so blind as those who do not want to see. @Pastor J Thats fair. @Pastor J i ahve my ears on the case and you are wright this is about our country and goverment
