8:36,19:30, " what now chair?? . . " k "chair said if he is well  The chair makes some of these advocates nervous. He comes across as being a bit agitated at times. "I remember him humiliating a female witness some months back. The witness had nothing significant to contribute. The chair bluntly dismissed her and tell her in private. 
22:27,35:58, what time does it start possibly in 2mins There was a delay to 10 am requested to sort out documents. The FM coding is playing havoc with there keeping to the statements. Needed to sort out some areas in the docs. "Their started Hello news lovers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💪💪💪💪💪 AMANDLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you should done this yesterday wna man morning guys now it seems they placed a microphone in the corridor and the actual speakers voices are distorted.. you mean to say the state cannot get this right? 
40:06,53:38, It's feedback from the Microphone picking up it's own signal through the remote Microphone on Naidoos end. Not much you can do. I am surprised SABC got that even close as they can't use a Mixer. Headphones on Naidoo's end should cure it though. This is bad😕 Judge Zondo is struggling with flu Yoh yoh yoh! 🤦🏽‍♂️😱 Crime Intelligence and SAPS need an overhaul 😢 True @ Rudi H I think I have heard enough. People need to be held accountable now! Tjo! so beki tjele doesn't feature today🤣🤣🤣 
53:46,57:37, "It means if anything happen to Zondo this inquiry will be on hold? of all the inquiries this one was suppose to be given a panel of judges to help "@zintle agreed zintle ndzwangu dream on this is a smoke screen to the world that are trying to come clean "@Kay Kay zintle Yey idliwe imali eSATAFRIKA andinamona lol "@Immanuel  It’s so sad @zintle ndzwangu. col naidoo is swearing now? does this accords with the processes and decorum of this commission?

"The entire SAPS is rotten throughout S.A. with exception to some organized crime unit members @makhosi nobhatyi @Sindiswa Moolman Uba niyawazi ama tutu. Yey Ngamasela aba bantu lol 
1:01:19,1:04:37, "@Kay Kay I so wish they could be called  Is Mdluli still in CI? 😂😂😂😃😃 I can’t wait to see these thugs going to jail babulewe abantu ngenxa yokuma enyanisweni bagxothwa abantu @ Sindiswa Moolman @Gee Peex1 Hello Press the orange button you will be on my CHENEL plzz "I think the FMs have been notified.

1:06:11,1:09:53, "@zintle he is no longer with CI It was all fun and games when Agrizzi and Hlaudi were testifying and singing. This right here is a lot to stomach hey. Hello guys @Immanuel So now is the right time ne hahahahah @makhosi nobhatyi why you want to make any of this about race? "@zintle ndzwangu Are you guys from North America? I have a question @João Souza This is a South African live stream "@Jack Sparrow it a shame and insult to us as poor people 
1:10:04,1:13:08, "Naidoo should never come out of the witness protection program Can they just give us these peoples real names... I wan to see something. black leaders with looting 😖😖😖😖 "I'm between going to NYC or visitading Alcatraz "@makhosi nobhatyi but your own people are everyone you live with in the country. rich and poor It's a lawless Country governed by Gangsters Alcatraz @Born free Gangsters of note! petrol lol why examine the shebeen claims 
1:13:42,1:16:25, "These people pretend as if they know our struggle but they are looking for their stomachs "Can political balancing take a back seat as people are arrested "Whats so special about these FM01-FM45... if Cele can be named This should be a lesson to those who are still looting.. Nothing stays hidden forever. Unqualified Police Gangsters Now I’m questioning the Constable that commissioned my ID copy last week 🧐🤨 liberation movements are not meant to govern... I was never ready for Mr Naidoos testimony!😕 lol... I dont know this forsure 
1:16:40,1:18:28, I'm laughing at Ranjeni... Karima is next electric bicycle @Bronx Wavy we hope karima is next. iqbal toady SA needs a shutdown. Ayikho alok le bicycle donated by Steinhoff I think all these FMs are implicated individuals who can’t be named by a faceless individual. I think it’s a legal requirement...my take. 50k per month for a police informer with no qualifications.......unbelievable. eish Which politician is clean ... 
1:18:37,1:20:01, "I am so glad now everybody knows why there no prosecution for Guptas Is Karima and Rajeni friends or former colleagues or something like that? yeses it's a lot R 50 K. @Marcus Mmola Zille is clean - but she's a bit of a pampoen @Mmola EFF Top 6 @Eliot Chauke hahahahaha!!!!! @Sindiswa Moolman But they did name some of them who benefited from all this criminality. What is so special about these FM gangsters? will anyone go to jail for these crimes? They were both very vocal against Mbeki and were big supporters of Zuma @Kay Kay. Not sure their relationship standing now. 
1:20:03,1:21:31, Karima can't find a BOSASA story if it fell in her curry "Can a clean ANC stand up @threedeespace I dont see it happening. Is Agrizzi still out on bail? My take on the FMs is that they're like undercover cops/agents. Their identity is better off hidden so as not to jeopardise their positions. 🤷‍♀️ dont see and what should happen are two different things I'm wondering what Batohi is waiting for... voice is a powerful for of identification these days "threedeespace it wont happen look at Esidemeni still walking free  
1:21:40,1:22:48, you may as well have the camera on. lol Batohi is in payroll of CR17 "@Eliot Chauke are you silly "Eliot Chauke ​Batohi is in payroll of CR17. Prove it not enough evidence for esidemeni... shameful Eliot Chauke well said lol jack parrow I can’t wait she promised us that they are not yet in a hurry to charge and arrest until they have full evidence collected so that there will be no more postponement because not enough evidence @Eliot Chauke Point on! 
1:22:48,1:24:43, "On Ranjeni CR17 leaks are out there... Batohi has done nothing but keep her seat warm thus far does the legal system use any software to capture and manage all these hearings... ? we should all chip in to get @Eliot Chauke a tinfoil hat "no one will get arrested @Sindiswa Moolman I get you but you actually should not get to personal on this chat Where is the witness. I can't see him 
1:24:44,1:26:07, S.A. NEEDS A BLEACH WAS OF ALL governing personell bleach wash what happend with the story on the dude who crashed his car near the airport. badly crashed @Bronx Wavy huh? Make them all white? @Bulali Rawana Uphesheya "no @Bronx Wavy omo. makes whites whiter and colours brighter @threedeespace Dead and buried. So this guy has been in witness protection for the past 8 years? When are the people he's running from donning their orange overalls? 
1:26:14,1:28:24, even the journalists are toying with the public "who stares at that ""witness"" sign?" They say Gavin Watson was already dead before he had the accident? We dont hve journalists in SA. we hve mouthpieces of the Elite Strange lol "lol. I know dead and burried It will be money making season for lawyers after this inquiry... I predict a protracted period of litigation and counter litigation. Why are they not showing him? 
1:29:01,1:31:05, "Mamellom Mpelo  @threedeespace Lol The family is not saying a thing except for that they know who killed him. He was already dead before the crash. Nomvula Makonyana promised to spill the beans soon tho his identify is sensitive to crime intelligence future and current operations @ mamellom cool cool. shot bro can somebody tell me what is going here lol. its a long story LOL make it short Where do we start Jennifer? 
1:31:16,1:33:31, someone else can. i'm chillin lol The Most Entertaining Witness so far.... Mr Hlaudi - basically.. a man is telling the truth... mostly Still scratching the surface. Watson is in Miami getting tipsy at Wet Wilie's gee - last word makes no sense... framing chair Mr s 
1:33:39,1:35:31, "Nomvul Makhonyana should spill the beans on how the Department of Water Affairs was bancrupted on her watch. Famous for ""picking up"" the Rand currency remark - still down. Waiting." 1 line of fog off tooo much chair does not get it give him a Chivas. thumbs up who is this witness?? witness not clear here thanks. true Give him a Smirnoff 
1:35:43,1:38:08, @Thando Nkutha thanks I notice the chair advises this advocate a lot the purpose of this platform is to comment on issues happening right now not nonsense the majority write about. well said Evidence leader sucks lol sy is moeg its been long since Witnesses implicate President Zuma... 😁😁 Crucial witness but weak or poor evidence leader 
1:38:29,1:41:07, "Kay they wanted to employ Libiya's wife so that it looks like it's him or he was part of it send the scorpions to find Watson i'm goin to eat. thumbs up all rise now👋 pizza. oh yeah! 😂😂😂😂😂😂 😂 Thando y not water I mean is too hot for tea Eish evidence leader uyakhinya 😩 
1:41:48,1:44:47, there will be no arrests... Mdluli was the sacrifice long ago "remember guys How are they selected to lead any way inquiries are the new courts "It would have been beneficial to see the likes of barry roux as evidence leaders of this commission 👋🏽 @Immanuel Jip Agree! Also Gerrie Nel? "when Zuma comes back inquiries find the light if day LONG before any prosecution does 
1:45:05,1:49:21, of* day Ngathi akalalanga tu lomlungu. Uyaphithizela nje ay DCJ is losing weight also.. Last night a devastating fire swept through an informal settlement and left 900 people homeless and with nothing. The looting of this country has left millions still in shacks. shame on you looters.

Michael Komape tragedy How long is tea break? @Immanuel Hahahahahhahaha 
1:50:27,2:01:39, Nindibize xabebuya kwi tea Usually 20 minutes evidence leader if you paid attention you will see that 90 percent of Hlaudi testimony has hurt himself everyday.. i think hlaudi was being honest but one think he did not realise is that his logic is stupid SA a haven for terrorists ?? chair is time at 1 you will talking about lunch @OscarTheo these champs are delaying us I would like to know how many tea bags we have paid for so far! 
2:02:37,2:06:19, "Blaze 613  Mara this commission is never on time ehhh the Chair must be very thirsty and really enjoying his tea given the period that has lapsed and still counting no wonder they have so many pp breaks @BLAZE613 exactly bra 😎😀 I miss the fiery advocate paid by VBS ghost accounts then placed in a handbag delivered by ranjeni @zintle ndzwangu Sebabyile kwi tea break.

Works wonders Canamed sorry false intelligence that's a strong statement** lol 
2:13:24,2:16:44, Where is Bheki Cele? I thought he is here today? Batohi is FM37🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️ "no evidence on vrous and queens today? DCJ also liked that a lot yesterday Does Judge Zondo smoke? what is happening here?? shamila is useless. just keeping her seat warm while ppl are fleeing and being assassinated @Bronx Wavy My sentiments exactly Immanuel don't start that madness from 500r to 5mill

2:20:33,2:22:13, did the Zuptas dissapear with the recerve bank? 1000 000%. (R500 x1mil %) so the witness is under the table? @Gee Peex1 it seems no one wants to make unpopular decisions toward their cadres Your president is part of it Colonel Naidoo is protected from who? SAPS members? this is a gangster state. Terence .. corruption money went to Dubai Resistance of Whiteness to Black Independence.....this is Super Evil and must be read as such Black majority capital never leaves the country... 
2:22:24,2:23:35, WOW No wonder the Witness has been in a witness protection for 8 years. Lorna...Stelembosch Mafia is is control because the majority is black So true @ Jack Sparrow "@Redriger Disregarding Black State Unfortunately Black they have a pact with Lucifer...its clear "@Jack Sparrow

I named my son after him Guptas took the money and ran off back to India and Dubai nothing apologetic about black majority in black continent And those high heels and wigs 🤣 BMC is real Can Guptas be arrested or extradited? or are they safe? Can Rupert be arrested too. BMC is ANC and nothing else💯 
2:25:08,2:26:39, and your president is part of it... WMC is a myth... investors have taken their investments to more profitable countries.. @Terance Nzuza rupert can't be arrested because he's done nothing illegal "@Terance Nzuza  @Sparrow BMC will be real after we take The Land. now u r stil dreaming BMC=ANC ANC=BMC @Eliot Chauke you're not getting any land Whats this R500-5Mil yall talking about? Im so lost now "no one is getting land 
2:26:48,2:29:13, jack.....you choosee what to believe....how is he making his money....through black blood and suffering...its old money made from our tear.... Land has never been free you have to buy it to own it. Dream on "@Terance Nzuza  born free lets be reasonable... people had to come from diff corners to do ask thus land confusion now. it's global @Sparrow do u own a piece of land? all* this* how do you use a redacted ticket to board a flight? or am.i losing something here? Jean-Pire...greta then he should relate with the struggle of the poor.....how is he helping the poor...through political loybing? "even if I got land 
2:29:37,2:32:25, "@Eliot Chauke no of course not. hardly anybody owns land. I live in a city "@Terance Nzuza  LAND WAS FREE ALL OVER THE WORLD when indigenous had it. then the disease came with conquerors @Sparrow then we cant talk about land. you dont qualify✌🏿 "@Bronx Wavy  this is happening in police also @Wavy Spot On anyone sharing the surname aplesamy here? ayeye🤣🤣🤣 You have to connected to the crooks in the government establishment to own land 
2:32:25,2:34:41, "But I agree "@Eliot Chauke okay lady loya looks like she wants to cry Jean thank you for the tribal info. it was between iindigenous inhabitants For every action...there's equal but opposite reaction...1st law. Musi must go to ANC😁 DA is done using him Is Batohi going to reinstate the Mdluli murder case buried by Jiba&Mrwebi or not? even the ancestors must eat It took Zuma less than ten yrs to destroy every fiber of government as compared to more than 300 yrs of apartheid rule 😪 
2:34:55,2:36:35, "R8500 back in 2010 was substantial "@Bronx Wavy  no double standards Musi must now go and lead VF+ @Jean-Pierre Le Roux it's complicated. you can't understand cos you white "@Bronx Wavy  🤷 give the land and watch how sa turn into Zimbabwe 
2:36:47,2:38:43, Is Mdluli still in his position to date? "@Jack Sparrow  jean you simply created another class that wasn't there before. only difference is now you think you can claim LAND. this CUCKOLD has been happening since the boat landed DA are zionists CUCKOLD? Kay Kay Mdluli has been found guilt of kidnapping ect a few weeks ago. Sentencing this month. @Le Roux you are the only 1 who is white in your family? 😁😁😂😂 jean I made that comment with respect and matter of fact BMC = Black Monopoly Communists 
2:39:01,2:43:26, I smell tax evasion on the part of Mdluli... maybe Sars need to ready I think yes jean it's a fact that you're a cuckold. some random bloke on the internet said so Eliot if jean is white then his children are white despite appearance "@Bronx Wavy  "(oh wait "@Jack Sparrow  @Le Roux thank you. Sparrow is just like Penny... there was a backup plan against corrupt officials... its called the US 2nd Amendment bang bang 
2:43:33,2:47:22, "I miss Ms Gcabashe  S.A. point of no return "@Bronx Wavy  Does General Mdluli still work in the intelligence service? Cele wants to take all our guns like in China. No surprise because China is getting us ready for our Chinese President. We have been sold to China safe house is a house with a safe in it? right? @Kay no he is not with them The way on TV SAPS hold shotguns and coffee at the same time "SABC Cameraman 
2:47:23,2:49:57, Thanks @Jean-Pierre Le Roux for revealation "@Redriger@Rudi please start arresting same way they used a Kenyan nobody knows named Obama to fight for Zionism and satanism I heard of this new Chinese American candidate. he wants to give all Americans 1k a month for life "@Sthakathi Khumalo  Bronx focus on the subject. not the worlds problems I didn't bring it up. I responded What is the point of all these commissions if NO ONE has been been arrested or prosecuted???? 
2:49:58,2:52:39, yes indeed and don't single me out Wild look no further start in parliament Ricus they are distractions from the real endgame Jean-Pierre Le Roux but whats the point of showing nothing but a witness tag!! I'm worried weather the state capture is waiting ourtime or not itaa general worning to all keep on the subject and leave all other matter off here. you have other chats for each subject here we on the State Capture points ag k$k man tired of sabc bias 
2:54:18,2:56:21, Shamila is team Cyril. where is all this blind faith coming from? Cele is making his own fire this country is a goner ons land is in sy MOER In China they exicute corrupt polititions that's a fact Jean Zuma showed these mamparras how to do it!! "What is the relevance of this we all know that all anc/goverment they corrupt no one will be jailed 
2:56:56,2:59:36, i agree We need to stand up as citizens of this country to hold those implicated to account we should not wait for the Govt to hide these corrupt officials Hear Hear!!! crime intelligence relates to state capture in a way that officials can use Intel to intercept bad reports on officials or they can use Save Face tactics from intel Wanneer gn ons If no prominent arrests are made the ANC will lose hold that is for sure every major election from now will be c governance.. but that truley is the answer @red that too co* governance 
2:59:37,3:05:23, "Thanks lol none of can do nothing "Gee Musi doesn't want to fight crime they think they are untouchable what is I've noticed that what is it that naidoo don't understand on the q get up and stand up for our children ja los ma die commission da gn niks km

3:20:10,3:25:06, what is this all Raven Penny you can say that again same opus operates as Bosasa. I told you @ Immanuel 🤣🤣🤣 "Who put this guy into ""witness protection"" and whom is he being protected? If he has given this evidence to whoever is protecting him That is ip to DA and parliament to make a call. if it's wrong he must go and face the courts. mehats good for one is good for all. hunger and wars corruption you name it Africa if he did not declare it then he is in the wrong. africa is the motherload of all problems 
3:25:25,3:29:02, "Re protection for Naidoo.- He has been protected for the last 11 years. He was just the bagman for corrupt cops. This is not State Capture does anyone know know what happened to R70 found in Gavin's wallet? i see its lunch time and it might come very handy🍖🥩🥓🍔🍟🌮🌯🥙🍼🍹 "But if this Guy is in Witness Protection yes he will need to get all his ducks in a row. government is the criminal all rise "@Eliot Chauke obvious lunch time 👍😎
