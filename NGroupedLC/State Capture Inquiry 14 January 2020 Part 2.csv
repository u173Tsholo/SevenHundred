African refugee just ask your mind what I'm saying I think Zondo is forgetting that he Is the Law...... 
1:52:19,2:05:54, I think DCJ is making sure that his findings and instructions can't be overturned in court. @Anne agree with you @Anne M. ..I really hope you are right........like i say....losing a bit of faith in him Zondo has rules he must comply with else his findings will be challenged procedurally. Not so with the State Capture criminals. some people don't want the Truth to come out... ask yourself why? @Itumeleng Rathebe ...True Bra.......Too much at stake I reckon ........ They don't wanna do jail time...and don't wanna give up the stash of Dollars..... banna kgane chair molato ke eng? NDL
