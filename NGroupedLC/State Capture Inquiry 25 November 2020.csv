Yes!!! 
29:40,30:22, Geoff Makhabo is he the guy who made R30m cash in his back pocket from City of Joburg thru Guptas? Anyone know if this is the guy? "It's really true that you must never trust a politician Valencia.... days of our lives😁😁 @Mike Clark yes it is that one Correct people born yesterday are directors 🙄🙄 @SanFran Arnold .. so son of ex chief justice speaks to deputy chief justice? sounds too familial "Hi Alta Makhubo business was trading with the state and stealing at the same time. 
30:32,31:34, this guy a forensics expert. OK. let him flow he knows the game incestuous This guy's did his investigation very well ... @Diana they only worry about their kids and families and cadres.

That is what is happening here @zip reeper Powell is a pro .. changes his socks 2ce a day and never uses his handkerchief 
31:39,32:51, why are people without qualifications been employed in higher positions. it's like sending someone with a grade 3 to run our country yho @Valancia it is correct period. Makhubo is corrupt and Zizi Kodwa must account how can he enjoyed money coming elsewhere than his own salary Apparently Makhubo is gonna testify as well @SanFran Arnold Is Geoff Makhubo the Mayor of Johannesburg? @Pastor J.J yes it is that one @phakamile we still controlled by stomach that's y we afraid of change loooool cANCer 
32:55,33:35, ID numbers even @vuyisa sandile but the problem is they are hiding under Anc @Sandile it would've been great if that was the case but as clear to south Africa culture.. it's usually associated with stealing. All connected to politicians is always high rankers ever wondered why 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 @SanFran Arnold Please tell Naledi and Anne I greeted them both 3 times It was all along clear that ANC cadres are corrupt to the core - it is about ANC people here in South Africa. There is no holy cow in the ANC circle. Geoff Makhubo is the current mayor of jhb WHAAAAAAAATTTTT 
33:38,34:18, Heyyy what transparent findings indeed we're furnished with ID numbers. @SanFran Arnold I will be very suprised if Geoff -i love the poor- Makhubo pitches-if he does the lies will fly-and hes forgotten what lies he told in the past "They must invite Zizi Kodwa "there are so many people who have qualifications sitting at home with out jobs.. like the people who run eskom R34mil for no work done ???? viva Mashaba viva Acton SA "@Pastor J.J will do. @Naledi Barron @Anne M.
