But race now has a higher profile in our communication than any other aspect of ourselves. Sad. who is perpetuating race card "@Dominic 
18:36,20:32, Indias landed a wedding plain on southafrica airbase this one they must hung @Dominic Przybylski It is so sad. My daughter's classmates never saw each other in race terms till grade 3. Now as grade 6s they have split along racial lines and they are hardening if i was king @Dominic Przybylski . It seems that the more we try and convince ourselves that we need to embrace each other the more i meet people on the chat that reminds of the past. very sadly so Dominic Przyblyski the mouth speaks from the abundance of the heart..it‚Äôs who they are. @Lex Luger . I actually did but it seems that my prayers do not work anymore since i retired this year "Old school gentleman "Pastor Will this testimony not compromise military security of the country? 
21:01,23:12, @Pastor J Some voodoos like Bafana Bafana are not deserving of prayers. You just watch the voodoo unfold as it would @Nyasimi Geoffrey: Do not expect respect from an individual who doesn‚Äôt respect themselves. Zuma is such an individual. @Pastor J you should fast and repent @Thami Ngwenya . Yes Thami but some of our brothers are so blatant on this forum and the rascist comments are deeply painful "@Nelson Musoliwa No @Lex Luger who's the witness? @watson mutanga this man Zuma must have brought so many respectable institutions into disrepute i guess @LYD online tv The chief of the airforce of SA 
23:25,24:56, Thanks Anne for clarity @Pastor J for your prayers to be answered. @Lex Luger is he the one who let the Gupta landing? "Where does this race card emanate from in this group.It is when people calling name like stupid followers @Aniceth De Missamou . Yes yes I will heed your advice @Aniceth De Missamou The pastor has said his prayers retired with him @Nyasimi Geoffrey: He started by dismantling institutions of government. These stood in the way of corrupt practices. @Nelson Musoliwa üëç "@LYD online tv No 
25:13,26:30, Chief of air force but taking no responsibility at all. Passing the bug. @LYD online tv He was too high to handle landings "@Lex Luger it's dangerous "We need a culture of individual responsibility Number one gave instructions period @Lex Luger Interesting! 6 months as Chief sounds like a lot of time on the job. @Aniceth De Missamou I am just teasing brother "Guy is lying No best system can be safe from unscrupulous people; instructions from above confused the standard operation procedures 
26:33,28:19, Yip! @Richardt Human ‚ÄãbChief of air force but taking no responsibility at all. Passing the bug. Chair is now deliberating...!!! "Nelson Musoliwa the pink ones @Thami Ngwenya I agree with you If you tell the truth you won't need to think ! #Justsaying whos this guy he is making excuses "@Dominic Przybylski: I agree. One of the solutions is for each adult to find themselves. Most people lack social and emotional intelligence The chair sees through him. I said this guy is full of himself. 
28:46,29:43, this oke thinks he can throw wool over Zondo's eyes we have lost.... we facing Egypt. answer the question Chief..they knew the correct process but deviated from it. Yip @Yolo More. He is a slime ball like Zuma. question says all of you no 1 saw its wrong instead he explain ai More unfortunately one must not swallow more than what can chew; learn we have and very fast time is of an essence. @matt kumalo Can't the team just call in sick on the day @matt kumalo I think the players have won though... Did he go for the wedding too ? 
29:46,31:09, @Yolo More: that‚Äôs down to perception. One can say that the guy is confident and or passionate. "These checks and balances seem to be the 'scapegoat' @matt kumalo R320k each... "@Sofia Sofia No @Sofia Sofia Yes he was one on the drivers in the Land Rover. @LYD online tv so they can embarrass us "Ewald Kruger No @watson mutanga. He is trying to manipulate the attention away from himself. Slime ball. R320k....?????üò´ now we have really really lost 
31:17,32:04, "Chief Yes or No You cannot work on trust and integrity. You work on policies and procedures! No matter who made the error in the line of command - you as the leader remain accountable!! "As Chief of Air force "Exactly @Yolo More ‚Äã Ewald Kruger "Watson Mutanga @matt kumalo yes they got paid R320k each for getting to the ast 16. How Lucky?! is he reading his evidence ? "As the Chief Of the air force 
32:27,33:22, "yeaahhh the okes are having a big party. laughing CHIEF is protecting someone. this GUY MUST BE SEROUS Trust and integrity can not supersede standard operation procedures; this guy is confining himself to military oath of not giving away your commanders. doesn't seem to be much of a disciplinary to me. Pathetic leader of the Air force. Suurstof dief. they should have kept the prize money secret.... you know us south africans they don't checks and balances even now people we are not safe 
33:48,35:32, The leader is laughing...WOW... """We do not have enough people who stand for what is right."" Summarizes the whole sorry mess." "In China "How can we trust this guy with our country "if we are attacked tomorrow "The reason ""Checks and balances"" are not there so they can get away with anything. For how long that institution has be established that there's no such? The Army is always well organised anywhere." In China he would have been hung for treason Chief of defence force would be cadre-deployment without a shadow of doubt. @Legae Nyalungu Have you forgotten how clueless they were is small Lesotho? 
35:59,38:10, Our country is at huge risk with this guy being in charge of the air force. "Yes chair Our officialdom is vastly manned by spoiled brats as this commission revealed thus far. these people domt care if your wealth leaves the county they dont care if youl be poor for generations to come along as the get a piece of the pie he is a liar this guy This guy double liar All I see him do is protect someone .... This chief is lacking appropriateness for the occasion. If he wants to crack jokes with Zondo they must make a date for that. I am dissapointed in this brother He has been trying to escape all the questions. 
38:14,40:03, "He needs my lawyer He needs Vincent Maleka does matter if someone is new!!! there are policies and procedures. He is a useless leader. How could this man handle a real war if he was overwhelmed by a single incident in CAR and one helicopter crash? "Thami Ngwenya THe answer is NO i dont get involved "They are two he did not get involved before but he is getting involved now LMOA 
40:07,42:02, south africa will be fine when those prisoners get old n new peole take over cause now n then when they speak i was in jail 16yrs ai veeery funny witness....to much for comfort..

42:10,43:03, "Nyasimi Geoffrey @Kapn Krunch . He actually qualified and practiced as a lawyer in johannesburg and continued his study in prison. this! i guess it was funny for him Unfortunately neither education or prison seem to be available anymore..... @Kapn Krunch @Phillip Cwazibe thats what he claims hahaha Look at him. He thinks this is a joke. No laughing matter. There were no consequences. No one fired. Only some promotions. Gut wrenching to see how lightly S African citizenry is treated and taken. Awwwhhhh Shame ! 
43:05,44:25, Just leave him go he is useless for this commission This is how power speaks by the way i can see power in this man.....those long pauses and that deep reflecting "The problem here is a cultural one. Not Black or White but an organizational one of a documented formal structure and then the one that really worked A poet deep reflecting or deeply decieving This is a politician not a military man @Yolo More LOOOOOOL I wanna hear what came out the preliminary investigation. lol he is the wrong man for the gob need someone like Zonda 
44:48,45:39, üòÄ üòÄ üòÄ @Nyasimi Geoffrey ‚Äã This is how power speaks by the way i can see power in this man.....those long pauses and that deep reflecting And the Oscar goes to.............. David Mahlobo was Minister of Security Cluster mos... whose this guy He rehearsed this 20 times infront of the mirror this morning. That's what it looks like to me. @Kevin Allister Simon: I agree. Corruption thrives when institutions are weakened. The corrupt start with dismantling institutions - for their gain. That inquiry they had what was they under took i expect heads would have rolled people sent home "this guy must be fired guys haiboo it you where in the military would you trust this guy to lead 
45:43,47:11, Next a Molefe cry baby show from him He must go to 7 deLaan this one. No seriousness at all for his position. @Mulunghisi Mulunghisi another JZ stoogie. If he feels so deeply about this HE SHOULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING @mulunghisi Lt Gen Msimang chief of airforce What was the cabinet actions on this matter where Zuma was a chair of meetings as a president or leader of state @lyd thanks and his position You have to be fucken joking..... put my life in his hands.... never@Mandela's child vryhied @Mulunghisi Mulunghisi Chief of the Airforce 
47:20,48:15, Camera zooms in so we can feel the TEARS üòÄ üòÄ üòÄ Kraaist Jesus this is f@cking embarrassing to watch. he was preparing for the wedding "Abel Matshidiso shockingly... unacceptable... pathetic acting The system was fine its only that corrupt individuals manipulated the system for their own benefit. @Abel Matshidiso he said he had no involvement of that particular operation hahaha ASK him how was the biryani ? @Abel Matshidiso why is he not in his full uniform. to show respect to the air force Evidence leader not sharp 
48:26,50:56, The buck stops with him. Well-rehearsed and re-arsed The buck doesn't stop in this country @Michael Wild "Very embarrassing Ministers don't count!!! Missing the point! Thami Ngwenya she is feverish. Otherwise she is brilliant. Who is going to suspend this guy and when. The plane should have been intercepted and forced to change route to either Pilansberg or Lanseria.. The guy is all over not leading If this doesn't indicates a banana republic status then i do not know 
51:04,52:13, If he don't give us the truth will ANYONE else give us ? "Whoever keeps on posting youtube clips Why wasn't the plane seen as a threat and shot down seeing that nobody knew anything about it? Or have we simply lost ? "YES CHAIR it's a robot like the Bell Potinger Facebook pages @Pheladi Lamola asked myself the same question. what steps did you take chief.. EVIDENCE LEADER got him! 
52:15,54:04, "Lamola that my point "since there is No1 referring to President e.g former President Zuma They should have refueled the plane at OR Tambo and sent it back to India. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÉüòÇ@ Thami Ngwenya @Richard Andani Democlish Jarana he's caught now. lol i agree True Derek. and fined biting his tongue Boko Haram will come easy here to bomb us using our own people to open gate 
54:17,55:48, i don't think we will get anything from guy. ubaleka nenyani lo molome bobby molome!!!! Got Wind !! That foreign aircraft in our SA base So even today this guys are scared to say they acted on Zuma's instructions he is a disgrace....he must give back his pay Lock him he will speak the truth @carnoth ngomane because Zuma is coming next week. They are playing it safe not to be exposed. lol What ever instructions they got from zuma is not in black and white I guess if he has to be honest he will have to pay back his share of the pie which is probably eaten already ! 
56:07,57:27, I had the privilege of being under the command of Jan Breytenbach who is a retired career South African Special Forces military officer. "He is best known as the first commander of 1 Reconnaissance Commando Evidence leader is weak on this witness today; seems she didn't prepare adequately "This is not serious now but it is serious as they articulate they put the country in standstills and at risk This lady is leading this guy @Shadrack N i guess you are correct hence they cant point a finger at him These are the type of people we need in the defence force not clowns and actors "Carnoth Ngomane Not approved since 2013!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
57:51,1:00:12, Still haven't set up the checks and balances. How long does it take? How long does it take to approve a document? "@Yolo More i doubt if he will be useful I read in the news Agrizi dint have enough evidence ...What does that mean for this inquiry? YEARS obviously Carnoth Ngomane üòÇüòÇ The people at the top level of our country don't seem to be concerned enough to act upon anything except their own pensions. Sofia Sofia he must come back. We miss him. Instruments...matrix...evolution... üòÄ üòÄ üòÄ Jissas this guy is a *anker of format. 
1:00:39,1:05:44, @Yolo More Zuma doesnt CARE @Yolo More he got no more to tell "This man is the head of the air force. The first man with the authority to refuse the plane the right to land was a sergeant major Zuma was so stupid he thinks being a commander in chief of the army his words are also commands so he gave word that his guests must land at Waterkloof base PREACH General. You want all of us to listen to you but you don't want to respond to the questions. Who is giving evidence now? Stop him now chair. @kaapstad18 Another one of Zuma puppets Wonder whether the same flight would be possible over China. 
1:06:07,1:07:24, I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt mention who informed them Interesting that our chief of the air force appears to be wearing a Chinese uniform. Big Titles for nothing ! Bloody bureaucrat! Already the proposal sounds so complicated you'll spend time retraining and getting no work done. hahhahahhahahahahahahhaha this is not chinese hahahhaha chinese... lol Its a Star Trek outfit @Dominic Przybylski not Chinese but Indian

"LYD @Keith keith ‚ÄãMy this guy said no in writing. Who authorized it after that is a glaring question. "Purple rain From a warrant officer to a major in 5 years not possible unless corruptionis involved

1:14:13,1:15:08, The evidence leader fails to ask how the promotion was possible if there were two lieutenant ranks and one captain rank to hurdle before getting to the major rank. Hahahhaaha That's why we have an army and airforce. Get on please. @Yolo More he's trying to do some damage control 1 Halo coming right up üòá for this one ...
