Lets see how many years for legal action to take place... "And Zuma wanted these thieves running our treasure 
40:06,1:06:55, itjoo people stole money under zumas nose shame Zuma's counterparts still active in govt... "this commission should investigate SAA to see why the state has to continuously bail them out "Mabuza has a muddied past All the new deputy Ministers out shopping for 2 new üöòüöòR1mil + each The delay of Ramophosa 's announcement of his ministers was due to a last ditched plea not to appoint Mabuza as deputy President. @SCELO GUMEDE And there's the connection - Issa is a Gupta crony - who are close friends with our previous president. "JP Morgan hey @Lee Hendrix will the elite that control everything ever allow Africa to thrive on its own? 
1:08:04,1:18:37, Gama has sold black South African entrepreneurs together with his executive team.They all they have to be accountable The executives get paid lots of money. South Africans should hold all executives accountable. "yes Money is the controlling factor spot on there... which is really sad what purpose does this inquiries serve? Executives were there. They must all account. It can't be just Gama and Molefe. All executives should account. They were part of EXCO. to investigate allegations into state capture These implicated have ruined Transnets reputation anything related to the Guptas is corruptible and questionable. When this executive of transnet going to appear at the court wakeup Npa 
1:19:26,1:57:12, @Lucy Lucy exactly .. I really liked Transnet We want those millions and billions back. They can create more jobs. NPA should take over. There's enough evidence to get the best picture. State Capture looters must face our mighty law. They must have sleepless nights. State owned entities are not private companies. The appointed executives are obligated to differ with their 'bosses' they are all civil servants at the end of the day. It's silly of the Transnet executives to only blame Gama and Molefe. They must all take responsibility. EXCO members must tell us as tax payers what happened. Exactly these ministers are public servants Unfortunately all these financial contractual blunders and misdemeanors have effected any growth in the economy and will have a lasting impact on our economies growth. Yip.. interest rates went through the roof I feel the impact every month. next time I want to invest money in a bank I want a floating interest rate...
