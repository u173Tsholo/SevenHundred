It's disrespectful. @Naledi Barron ty🤗 but today no one is angered buy this witness s rebilesion but if it was zuma even blind people will b here .guys let's face the trueth the hate of black people is out of this world am not saying he's @Mzalwane Mzala Exactly my thoughts. He seems to think he is above all else. "Yup "...sad agreed 
1:39:37,1:41:17, don't answer the question please just in case you incriminate yourself. @Mzalwane Mzala - I think he realises that the deck of cards is starting to fall & he is now very nervous & trying to cover it up with the smiling & laughing. His days are numbered. Anytime @ALTA skattebol. He was becoming tedious! @Pastor J.J i have been reading all you guys's comments for a long time. i have always wanted to be part of it but have found the racist comments quite disgusting. "....Being Educated means that a person should experience or do all sorts of things Stop playing the race card! what I know chair is Trump won the election &Jeffery Epstein did not kill himself .. apart from that I cannot recall ! @Pastor J. J - I also don't want to make this a race thing but I have noticed that white witnesses are treated with kid gloves in this chatroom and black ones are viciously attacked @Sabelo Nxumalo @Tshepo Alidi I have no idea what you are talking about. It appears that you are stereotyping me as an Afrikaner in a negative way??? 
1:41:18,1:42:05, @Santa Kriel 100%agreed. And it should never be tolerated or accepted in any form. "If you've only just logged on @Mzalwane Mzala  Kerry race is every where. You know what I am talking its just that it's hard for you to accept How can a man who is clearly incompetent get into the position that he was in? #right but check what is happening people are on camp chair talking of different thing not even watching this .bring black person here all of you even from England you have something to say huck . do you think mr zuma will go to jail??? oh my days 😱 @Tomb raider That should never be the case . That is indeed sad "Naledi i think you should travel the world & open your mind. Freedom of expression 
1:42:21,1:44:22, Tomb Raider its true. What is the purpose of having signing power if it is just a rubber stamp for someone elses decision? @Kerry van Schalkwyk - I can bet my bottom dollar that Zondo is an ANC member. Ask people what is the requirement to get these prominent positions in SA. Answer is ANC membership. EFF = 'we are all Efrica and there are no borders' (for their dope trade with muslims in Mozambique) "Identity politics is always a red herring Burger is a Delinquent 🙄. A judge is above Party politics. "@Sabelo Nxumalo - what you fail to realise is that each witness is judged on their own merits & how they conduct themselves on the stand. It is irrelevant of race Otherwise all ANC accused would be innocent and everyone else guilty. 
1:44:22,1:46:19, LET ME GREET ALL MALAWIANS HERE PRESENT IN THE NAME OF BUSHIRI @PHIL RAMBAY you are wrong. do not generalise. i am actually ashamed because this guys's skin colour is the same as mine. and it is obvious that advocate Kennedy doesn't respect him either @Kerry van Schalkwyk i 100% agree with you @Santa Kriel - agree @MOLLY please don't trigger me!! 😕 @Santa Kriel Why should you have shame because he is your race? This group guilt is a marxist idea. It's dumb. We are all individuals. EFF = well planned PC racist violence by the hypocrites Malema and Ndlozi against the only white man at the gates "I use to respect this kind of people holding the top positions in the companies "Oh 
1:46:20,1:46:57, ngyabingelela nje @alex makobe wilkinson Sadly we found that out all a bit too late EFF = Malema : 'I will die for the ANC' (while throwing Sindisu under the bus) Guys .He doen't know the Guptas Thats just what you aid. You were told to sign. alex me too we wer'e fooled ! Kerry you mean white witnesses treated this way because they are not corrupt and black get insults because they are corrupt? afternoon family. this chap looks cornered😀😀😀 @Aubrey De Bliquy - you are actually 100% correct. I don't subscribe to the notion that we must take responsibility for people's behaviour just based on race.

EFF = Malema who never worked a day in his privileged life @Mzalwane Mzala It's worth catching up later. Kennedy was hammering Burger on how he ignored Ms Malahlela (I hope the spelling is correct). 
1:48:39,1:49:50, read it 😏 He still hasn't apologised to Ms Malahlela!! it wasn't me ..I can take the blame if the collective cover is taken as the decision makers which I could have been part of ..

All shacks were erected after Mandela’s release in 1985. This was done to counter suburbs votes. WE SAW IT BEING IMPLEMENTED HERE IN Alexandra. I believe if Zuma was never the President of ANC n Country we blacks would be far by now. Mbeki did great for these Country Aubrey if Zuma is arrested then the commission will fail 
2:29:07,2:30:42, @Sabelo Nxumalo You probably don’t know anything about Codesa. Codesa brought RDP houses!

This present ANC government. Theyre cold & callous & failed this nation dismally. "Playing the victim is a toxic waste of time that not only repels other people PROBLEMS WID LIES YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WID DEM even white don't want to accept that they benefited from injustices of the apartheid. lots of air being wasted discussing opinions but hard facts matter here. Whatever the Commission finds at the end of it all best believe those findings are gonna go under review 😏. It sounds like an argument that he stole sweets too so it's OK for me to steal sweets. I dont get your reasoning @Sabelo Nxumalo 
2:36:59,2:39:55, Willem Steenkamp blocked for spelling our president's name deliberately incorrectly. Sign of enomous disrespect!!! How Ramaphosa has not been implicated in one single issue. This is not possible. Watch this space. @Sabelo pointing at anothers crime does not seem a goo defense for criminal activity. The other perswon must also be held accountable whoever it is.

Hendrix - yes @Lee skin color references is the easy way out 👌 All this done at the behest or instructions of Number 1 - being the then President Jacob G Zuma. Who vehemently denies any wrong doing . However we are aware as fact of underground tactics he did @SanFran Arnold - Then doesn't this room attack white witnesses as much as they castigate black witnesses? That was @Sabelo Nxumalo concern and I think he is making a fair argument. Jy het geweet jy lieg @Wele he thinks he can fool all the people all the time.

What you and yours have done to your people in 24 years is 100 times worse than 50 years of apartheid. @Fezile he trying to stay out of jail this one. @Kopz yes in all fairness I did. "Racist banter will not take us anywhere as a nation. The corrupt ones are laughing all the way to the bank No the problem with racism coloureds who are light skinned aren't affected but brown skinned and dark skinned coloureds know what racism is. So it is a complex debate to have. so humble Fezile you right this man is lying. 
3:29:36,3:31:06, @Valencia J .Cool stuff @Simsoneous Kultuur Well said.

For real I'm done with racist now. please just get on with your life. I'll. pray for one and all Liers Lies don't fix things. Best to tell the truth and then clean up an honest mess. Free advice... my view: the country is held by colonialist still. The union has collapsed the Afrikaaner Unie has self collapsed in 1970. The present government is an administrator. The rights is to vote @Fezile yes despite the oath they take. everyone just trying to stay out of jail. Nevermind the country. 
3:31:14,3:32:15, No race card here .Im only concerned about a credit card yet so untruthful @Valencia J - Is Benny Mccarthy the same coloured you are complexion wise? "If I was Burger this is a lying thief yerrr!

"and his lies keep biting him back! remember last week he said he didn't know regulations  @Kerry van Schalkwyk true that @Pastor I asked you a question earlier today I am yet to get an answer. @Tomb raider - I don't think so. He definitely did the right thing by laying a criminal charge against him & issuing another summons. Zuma must have his day @Valencia J I sent you 10 messages without a single response. Whats the ? Darling 
3:34:47,3:36:26, @Pastor I never saw even 1 message from you. I sent you one asking how you are doing. @Minnib Prince - You clearly don't know the history of South Africa. Valencia could have easily ticked she that is Caucasian during apartheid and no one would have know that she is actually coloured. sweets of the fast-lane I am so looking forward to the recommendations of this commission. NPA we are watching South Africa is sinking really fast but its not as bad as Malawi. Malawi doesnt even have traffic lights @Fezile Peko - 100% - they need to make the prosecutions!! @Kerry van Schalkwyk - Buy people on Twitter are criticising Zondo for wanting to take this up with Constitutional court.. @Fezile Piko prepare to be surprised 🤣🤣 but* 
3:36:29,3:37:49, "@Fezile Peko Twitter is nothing. Just a bunch of airhead keyboard warriors. not all off course @Tomb. .u clearly don't know history...whether u were light or dark skinned you we classified as black. .finish and klaar weren't you leaving J? his answer will be no! @Tomb raider - why would people do that? He is going straight to the court of last resort as it is such a matter of national importance. Maybe people don't understand that. Rambling Ramaphosa and ALL his promises and constant references to COVID and begging the international community for more money to be looted. meantime he made billions as a BBBEE partner even eff Bragg about how they will govern on Twitter meanwhile on voting day not even one municipality 😂 so Twitter is a useless as the cic himself "@Valencia J. Yes Twitter us full of weirdos

3:44:15,3:45:42, "Zondo biased the DCJ said he is a made of the ANC and attended public functions of the ANC that alone means he was not supposed to chair the commission at all just like Adv Dali cant head a commission. #justsaying @Mike 😂😂😂 Kopz answer the question don’t be xenophobic @Fezile ask @Ayanda. If you want to address me at least get my surname right. You misspelt my surname "@GIVEN MATSANE - he said he WAS a member of the ANC MOU vs Procurement policy. That should not be a point of debate.
