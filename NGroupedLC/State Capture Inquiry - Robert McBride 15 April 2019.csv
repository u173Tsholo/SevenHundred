29:17,41:39, @Yandi Masina i think Mcbide's testimony did not reach people's expectations hence they voted with their absence today Morning Morning Morning corruption is bad 4 our country Is Rob giving names or just stories? It's not stories...The then police minister nhleko is being proven to have acted illegally according to the Constitutional Court judgement I am still waiting for petrol money üòÄüòÄüòÄ Spider Lol 
43:11,50:11, Nhleko interferes with the independence of IPID I only have 3 beers left in fridge...Ace where are you?? Michael as deep as ethnic lines. "if all South Africans come together as one people Mugabe was rushed to Singapore for medical treatment.Just goes to show how he destroyed his country that he has no faith in his own health system.Its an African problem.Mabuza was treated in Russia Even the Nigerian president was treated in the UK for months...disgraceful Magda very true. we have divisions amongst all of our people. And that is going to destroy us. Nothing else. Nigerian President was treated in UK hospital just for ear infection Policing the police is a daunting task and dangerous one if parliamentary committee watch dog is not objective as ours was. 
50:53,54:30, Is that true? So apparently ear infections can't be treated in Nigeria...how crazy Politicians lie constantly and gullible people believe and vote for them time after time Africa. The past stopped in 1994. 25 years later we are more divided as a people than we were before. more poor. more unemployed. more uneducated more corrupt. more and more and more. @Afrika that is not true.. Someone said Africa is a grave yard because when its leaders fall ill thay are treated in Europe or else where but when they die they are buried in Africa Do you know of other heads of states or politicians coming to Africa for medical treatment? "@Nelson Musoliwa you have a point there We have brilliant medical professionals but they are forced to leave yhe coubtry due to bad government policies @Nelson Musoliwa That's because we allow our leaders to get away with it. 
54:49,59:29, Magda true I cant understand what is so special about europe.. SA needs law and order back. and people doing wrong should be placed in jail. otherwise we will not go anywhere but backwards and criminals will rule. I rest my case...its your choice to believe what you believe...btw I am not illiterate or dumb "@Michael Wild i agree with you @Derek imagine if we all got lot of money to be treated outside our country for any illness it would render our own health system useless. We need a new government. that Ace Magushle. hey that gangster guy. don't trust that man. wants to topple Cyril Ramaphosa. hey man. I'm scared for South Africa. "There are hundreds if unemployed doctors that completed their community service Bonjour madame comment allez vous 
1:00:15,1:03:49, Tr√®s been merci Monsieur Russell St vous? *Et Oui Anything new happened yet today? Chouette! tout va bien alors "@Afika Centane The Polokwne Conference was the down fall of the ANC Tes the two emails that Werksmans produced this morning was debunked by McBride's testimony oz' 
1:04:43,1:09:57, The Constitional court judgements proved IPID's independence and that the Minister of Police at the time interfered @Nelson Musoliwa Yes - it should be a law that all government ministers must use public facilities. Whilst I'm happy that he has come forward to the commission I still have a issue looking at him... knowing he killed innocent people.... especially young adults who had their lives ended by him. "@Nelson Musoliwa Theri kids must go to government schools @Robert Russell he killed white people @Thando Nkutha lol @Robert Russell I feel that way about de Klerk knowing his regime killed thousands And that makes it OK ????? I think PW was more to blame then De Klerk 
1:10:39,1:19:29, @Robert Russell why blame PW? "Magda Seguin  @ Derek i agree with you because they can not give their all to the improvement of facilities that they do not utilize. It is daylight robbery. @Lew464 try to learn about apartheid history..it's a shame that apartheid worked so well that we don't know about each other's pain and suffering. @Thando Nkutha I get you bro @Magda you are raised a crucial point in struggle point of view really. Undesirable that the oppressed could not consolidate their sufferings on a common ground I am not condoning the actions of the security forces etc. but taking the lives of innocent civilians is not cool.if MK was a ligit military outfit they would have complied with the Geneva convention So how many innocent civilians do you think died during 40 years of apartheid? When the casspirs entered the townships nobody was safe 
1:20:14,1:23:59, Security forces? against the majority of a population to uphold a racist regime? I agree with you... I don't condone it from any side on the debate.... but some people think it's ok because they are white... and that's why we we will never move on as country... @Robert Russell Unfortunately the Geneva convention is no longer worth the paper it is written on. The US regularly flouts it with their actions around the world. As long as part of South Africans are in denial about apartheid we will never be able to reconcile Yeah but I'm talking about in the early 70's @Derek Main "@Magda Seguin estimates are about 10000 deaths In the 80's if you didn't get home drenched in teargas and given 5 minutes to disperse with helicopters hovering above you will never know what we went through who has denied apartheid existed or the atrocities that it gave the majority of the country??? @Magda Seguin @Jack...I don't consider that number as remotely accurate 
1:24:24,1:36:18, @Magda Seguin yet it's quite well documented I don't know @Robert just judge g from the comments here makes me think that it is a microcosm of denialism I love DCJ Zondo's mind. "Magda Seguin  Mr Mc Bride uses the term .. common sense should prevail... did he use his commom sense in regards to the Magoos bar bombing ?? i think not.. just glad he has been terminated from his duties @Lew464 I am not going to engage on semantics with you "Dilip pls read the TRC transcript @Dilip Badal ... I think he did not use common sense killing innocent young people.... how does and action like that make any kind of sense ???? *any action 
1:36:30,1:40:06, This is the apartheid denialism and apologetic approach that Holocoast denialists also come up with. "@Magda Seguin ..Lew464 asks a valid question... you should reply accordingly I don't pander to apartheid denialism How does killing 22 year old brutaly through the gallows make sense "@Robert Russell ..absolutely correct "Those who did wrong must face consequences of their action Making excuses for a crime against humanity makes you complicit "Was there any common sense as far as the whole racist apartheid system is concerned including the actions of Wouter Basson And killing innocent civilians makes it ok to take the law into your hands????? 
1:40:39,1:45:16, A sane and logical person should condemn ALL violence...not in isolation when it suits their agenda "@makhosi nobhatyi If they all faced the consequences for their actions @Ndim Mavuks absolutely not... there was no sense at all in all the killings.... we could have way down the road by now of having a integrated country if the senseless killings were avoided I NEVER said it's ok to kill civilians..I just find it strange that people who mentions McBride' s actions must look in the mi...those who supported apartheid "We buried 10 "Before we can criticize past Just say outright that you maybe hoped Mc Bride was hanged...he was on death row like so many others. and I see that children are being used again in service delivery protests in Enerdale today.... what do you expect to happen... someone is going to get hurt or killed.... @makhosi don't change the subject...this is a specific discourse...we are all against the looting of the ANC and corporates. 
1:45:48,1:55:48, "These commission will help us to know what went wrong? And also give us a chance to fix it My last words on this...somebody said over the weekend that the Apartheid regime and the past 24 years plus is exactly the same thing.We are still being oppressed...just a different oppressor. And I agree "Magda Seguin I am not changing anything I don‚Äôt defend corruption some people will be shocked by state capture and will vote anc come may The Magoo's Bar incident was a legitimate military target as it was frequented by the apartheid army officers unlike the earlier Sharpeville massacre. McBride remains a hero of the liberation struggle How about this... R29m for a guards hut and ANOTHER R29m for gates and a dog kennel at one of our ministers houses.... this could build at least 580 RDP houses.... that ANC government for you. "If we lived in any other country or society "@ Ndim Mavuks ""Military"" Seriously ?? They were terrorists and committed terrorist acts! Nothing military about it" 
1:58:26,2:11:48, "@Magda Seguin I agreed with what you have heard "Then white arrogance declared ""no one is to blame"" for the senseless people of more than 60 people" "@Rust true...look how the Sudanese deposed Bashir after a 30 year dictatorship @makhosi and Ace has the gall to do door to door with a straight face Open Robin island again for those criminals and make is a tourists attraction. "Anc is in a process to correct this problem @PATRICK MANALA That is true and they are nothing but fools. Makhosi you are correct that is why we will give the ANC a 2/3 majority "Praising the ""liberation struggle"" is more anecdotal than what actually led to the end of apartheid. What really stopped apartheid was international economic and political pressure." 
2:11:50,2:17:42, @makhosi nobhatyi @Ndim Mavuks You must be fools to vote for a party that has proven to be so corrupt. You are voting for more of the same. It's the same as praising the 'Jewish struggle' for the defeat of the Nazi's. When in actual fact it was the allied forces that defeated the Nazi's.. Rusty I align myself more with the political that led to economic and international pressure and Derek it is too late to try and convince us with insults with just a few days to go before elections where's d chair bathong @Ndim Mavuks I know you can't be convinced. I'm just telling you you're a fool if you can't see the ANC is corrupt to the core. volume plz volume sound engineers dropping the ball "Yo DJ 
2:17:46,2:21:08, Sound missing @Rusty Correct "The question is; Is the ""rainbow nation"" possible to achieve? Can we live in a multicultural society @Rusty SpyGoat yes we can "the volume guy has gone full blast today "Hi everyone just sign in now "If we can not live in a true 'multicultural society' then we should create seperate states "Apartheid legacy lives on @Rusty it is correct in part as the Apartheid government was brought to it's knees by both the struggle and external pressure due to the international work done by Oliver Tambo and his team outside SA 
2:21:14,2:25:03, "Rusty SpyGoat  "As usual Sound Operator is asleep at the wheel. Cant call him a sound Engineer "Repeating the lies that the ANC is corrupt does not turn into the truth. I am sure all the corruption happening in the private and public sector equals to ""the ANC is corrupt"" @Ndim Mavuks is missing the point "Lew464 but how do we achieve equal opportunity? It seems to be so far away. Not only in SA but look at USA Then what is the point? Any name dropping today? "@Ndim Mavuks Have you not been listening to anything at this commission?? You need to take your blinkers off. It seems the problem is not the ANC "South Africa is the most diverse country in the world there is no comparison with USA 
2:25:32,2:27:29, @Ndim Mavuks The point is that the ANC is corrupt to the core and their members can't seem to see it. "Rusty SpyGoat  Exactly the truth of the matter.... the ANC are a collective... and so are their voters... both morally corrupt.... @Derek Main Most of the countries mentioned diversity is due to immigration @Robert Russell Hence why I say the ANC is corrupt to the core. "Tell me of one testimony in this commission that explicitly said ""The ANC is corrupt"" with facts and evidence" It is thus more difficult to achieve unity and equality "So the truth is we can‚Äôt just forget what happened during apartheid Justice Zondo has the most incredible voice. Could listen to it for hours 
2:27:44,2:29:48, In SA "@Ndim Mavuks I don't need someone to explicitly say ""The ANC is corrupt"". It can be deduced from the evidence so far." SOUND!!! "@Derek Main I totally agree that the ANC is corrupt to the core! With the Top 6 we can see it clearly. 4 of them are Zuptas Thank You!! @Ndim Mavuks Can you honestly say that none of the evidence here has pointed any fingers at ANC members? "Magda Seguin SA is not the most diverse country in the world. It is very diverse no doubt @Cerebis Yes exactly - look at the bunch of criminals they have put forward for us to vote for. @Derek Main ... releax you speaking to ANC Vota...<80.... what you expect??? 
2:29:50,2:32:06, Never forget Marikana. Ramaphosa‚Äôs hands are not clean The US diversity is very recent history hello friends! Apart from the US colonizers that mostly came from Italy and Ireland @Ndim Mavuks I understand your historic connections to the ANC but that organisation is dead a long time ago. The ANC of today is an entirely different animal. Time for you to find a new hero. "Thato Kelebohile Makgomatha  Yes South Africa is the most diverse...medical researchers call it the 'natural laborotary' due to the genetic pool "and your ""glorious liberation movement"" keeps crooks and thieves in parliament... nice one @Ndim Mavuks" "@Derek Main jip 
2:32:42,2:35:00, @Cerebis One thing you can be sure of with Ace is that he is plotting something. He's a gangster. Time out ??? @Cerebis Ace is busy setting up a parallel government. Best just to follow the proceedings...too tiring on this forum @Derek Main not according to @Ndim Mavuks all in the ANC are heroes... LOL!!!! @Derek Main I agree!! "@Alexander Dowdinng... Stop propagating Ndim Mavuks Tell me one testimony in this commission that explicitly said anyone is corrupt? This is an enquiry. This is not a criminal prosecution. 
2:35:18,2:39:11, @Magda Seguin Agree Magda.....Stick to your our advise please? Pls Rusty tell that to Derek Eslon. If you believe that I have a bridge to sell you The struggle continues! Struggle to steal. loot and keep the sheep voting for the cANCer "DA failed to go to listen to the people of Alex  @Ndim Mavuks @Rusty SpyGoat As I said Ndim (and I know you have some difficulty comprehending) - it doesn't have to be stated explicitly - it is possible to hear evidence given and form an opinion. "Derek Main I get that @makhosi nobhatyi What both the DA and the ANC are doing in Alex is shameful. Just finger-pointing with no accountability while the people suffer. "This farce will continue. Only the players will change. One needs to show remorse at guilt. The politician just says ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt me‚Äù 
2:39:41,2:44:14, So who was held accountable and was prosecuted for teh death of 143 Life Esimeni tradgety.... NO ONE... they are ANC members.... how does that work???? @Alexander Dowding. So you refuse to accept the findings of that inquiry or what now? Robert who was held responsible for the Sharpville Massacre no one The Godfather of Alex is sitting comfortably in parliament. Maybe the next book will be about him? "If Mashaba just went there without points fingering FFS.... Ndim.... move on we are in a new democratic dispensation or as you missing the apartheid era way of doing things "@makhosi nobhatyi If you are trying to imply that the ANC is not using the Alex situation for politicking Mashaba learnt the tendencies of white arrogance so prevalent today @Mandla cyril Mankoe I'll bet you believe in the tooth fairy too. 
2:44:32,2:47:14, Now we talking Mindlos "DA opened a space for ANC do their job Ndi masiari vhathu vha hashu "Im not diminishing the tragedy of the Sharpville Massacre. It was horrible "I am a descendant from a Danube Schwabe. Germans that were genocided in communist Yugoslavia after WW2 "@makhosi nobhatyi For the first time "We demand service delivery as we did even to the ANC  @Cerebis I agree - politicians being politicians. Shameful! "Thanks Rusty 
2:47:44,2:50:27, @ Cerebis - Any ANC as President will NEVER be for ALL the people of SA - the anc will never allow that "@makhosi nobhatyi DA is using the ANC as t election campaign cos they have nothing in store for the country "@Antonie Goosen SAD "@cerebis üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ you will learn every opportunity DA open ANC will respond """SA belongs to all who live in it"" Freedom Charter adopted by the ANC" "@makhosi nobhatyi I am not a member of the DA ‚úäüèΩ Ndim Mavuks Nothing in my statement insinuated 'move on'. At least I acknowledge the suffering caused to black South Africans. You however lack empathy to sympathize my greater loss. "Probably true 
2:51:21,2:55:10, @makhosi nobhatyi I want what is best for South Africa and currently view all politicians as a huge part of the Problem!! "Carnoth ngomane exactly all these parties their focus is ANC even when they deliver their manifesto you will hear Anc when there is rotten potato's in a bag u don't through away the bag but only useless ones "SA is home to all Including racists farmers who abuse the people @makhosi nobhatyi they know they wont win hence they play the man not the ball I agree regarding the future of SA. It seems politicians are inherently criminal. Old dispensation or new dispensation the problem appears to be the same All thanks to EFF with their findings of state capture.... "@ cerebis we all need what is best for South Africa no one should politicized people problem @makhosi nobhatyi On that point I fully agree with you! 
2:55:44,3:01:16, "We wish all opposition parties well as they fight for opposition seats EFF never find anything they just hijacked it.koena Was it the EFF who brought about the commission on state capture? I did not know that. Maybe they should lie low when we get to VBS bank? Ha ha @koena jonas All thanks to the PP and her findings on state capture "You have a ""On Point"" there @Brian Mercado" "@ cerebis we are not looking even ANC not to respond to the problem of the community as Gwede Mantashe says @Jack Sparrow 100% True Jack!! @makhosi nobhatyi .... I think it's more like who gets there first loots first with ANC.... nothing to steal.... then move onto another municipality... "Mc Bride is really not my ‚Äòcup of tea‚Äô I suppose because I was close to Magoo‚Äôs when the bomb went off 
3:02:05,3:07:25, @carnoth ngomane So vote for any other party execpt the DA or ANC then. It's not rocket science. "We don‚Äôt need people who will feel nice when she or he sees media "@Derek Main i know who to vote for and why @makhosi nobhatyi I put it to you that the ANC is not capable of fixing problems they created in the first place. You're only fooling yourself. @Mandla cyril Mankoe True - the only problem is the ANC bag would be empty. @Brian Mercado That's right - we have just changed one set of corrupt politicians with another. "@carnoth ngomane You're going to get my advice anyway. Use it "There many protesters across the country where the ANC lead or DA lead "The ANC is not corrupt 
3:08:26,3:10:28, "@Ndim Mavuks You're using the ANC stratgey of ""If you tell a lie often enough @Brian as much as the struggle was prescribed to be fought with due diligent there was no doubt that civilians will at time be caught in cross fire so ja he unwittingly got involved How can the ANC not be corrupt when they kept Zuma in power knowing what they did....@Ndim Mavuks dealt with when? @Ndim Mavuks when Jesus come back. "No I am repeating what you said Derek: ""corrupt politicians"" remember" @Derek Main then you are just wasting your time sir cos i know where i stand and i dont get moved any force whatsoever "@Derek main you need to understand we are not talking about who created ndim mavuks you totally right but if we could see at lease one jailed we know the ANC is serious right now they all playing for time and money leaving the country @Ndim Mavuks you are correct 
3:10:46,3:12:31, After the 2/3 majority victory after the May 8 elections @carnoth ngomane That's fine by me - I'm not going to stop saying it. You will wake up eventually. "even if u r saying its not the EFF I think Macbride didn't loose track of what we struggled for hene he did his best to continue fighting wrong things which even endangers his own life @Derek Main keep dreaming we need to be quiet certain in decision making on the 8th of May South Africa has a serious problem if the ANC gets a 2/3 majority.... first thing will be a credit down grade for sure. @Robert Russell That was the ANC parliamentarians not the common supporters. That is the big flaw in our electoral system highlights. Members and the President should be directly voted in. "@Derek main people was complaining about simple things 
3:12:37,3:15:15, "@makhosi nobhatyi Absolutely @carnoth ngomane And you keep your head stuck firmly in the sand. The common voters should have shown their disapproval but didn't .... @Cerebis "the only way to end corruption is to vote the ANC out "It's ""IPID"" chair The only hope for the country in terms of fighting corruption and reduce racialised unemployment and inequality is a decisive ANC victory as confirmed as confirmed by the ratings agencies @Derek Main the sand feels cooler than your advice @Ndim Mavuks decisive ANC victories for 25 years haven't even dented unemployment "@Robert Russell Agree! Thay however only have a chance every 4 years. They have not used that opportunity. The voters vote for the ANC 
3:15:17,3:18:14, @makhosi nobhatyi Why don't you tell us a bit about how the ANC cadres stole the money that was meant to be used for improvements in Alex? 90% of Anc officials are corrupt @Themba J Thobela A conservative estimate. @carnoth ngomane Coming from someone who thinks the ANC is cool - that's no surprise. "@Ndim Mavuks i dont agree @Themba J Thobela where do you get those starts 90% @Ndim Mavuks Expecting the ANC to sort out corruption is like expecting the Ku Klux Klan to sort out racial prejudice. Holomisa is spitting fire at PIC "@Derek Main thats your problem 
3:18:16,3:21:24, The ANC has over the years made a lot of progress and the majority knows it and yes ngomane dealing with the corrupt elements will surely follow "Woow @Themba J Thobela  @carnoth ngomane There are plenty of alternatives. It's just that the fool ANC supporters can't see the immense harm the ANC is doing to SA. we are living in a country of enquiries and all of them are about looting @Ndim Mavuks dealing with corrupt individual doesnt have to follow rather it must be done now than later "@Derek main hawks must come up with investigation look where is money and those who did wrong be charged @Themba J Thobela And the common denominator in all the looting is the ANC. @Derek Main you are like a doctor who give diagnosis but cant advice on medication hence i dont take you serious. security agencies only exist because the police are incompetent it's the private sector doing governments job for them
