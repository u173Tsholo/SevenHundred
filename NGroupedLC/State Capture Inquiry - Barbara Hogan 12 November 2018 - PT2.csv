Billions were wasted and stolen there. Denel now can't pay salaries "Thando is making noise about stuff he has been reading and making them sound as evidence she is not answering the question "@Thando Nkutha then I think it would be better if you say ""allegedly""" 
40:39,44:31, Thando is right. why was Gama put on suspension? because of corruption. I do believe Thando Nkutha "if is the 1 who gave Gupta contract from transnet I can't believe that 2 little brothers came and captured our country over curry.

1:13:23,1:16:02, my ex president who build a kraal with tiles for the cows hahahahaja he is a strong man 90% of SA is owned by our beloved Oubaases. We must dehlfejd them. We can’t allow Guptas to try steal business from them. It’s wrong! "This lady is talking to much You were sleeping in your job minister. give us the names Because she seems like knowing everything even the dates. Seriously why does each party get a term and lets see how it goes but big decisions should be a combined decision Pravin is a very dangerous scoundrel Barbara is in trouble Guptas took a huge risk. Us Africans do stationery and catering business. Why did they touch our Oubaases business? That’s wrong! Let’s fight for our Oubaases gents! 
1:16:03,1:18:50, Sounds like a Netflix movie with all these actors.... "motabogi I blamed them when they go to Polokwane to elect Zuma I told them u took wrong direction now by my brother Malema was there but now he act smart like he was not part of corrupt President "Its the first time she says NO @noko yamebetlwa the worst part is that the same Malema now wants to be president Atul was wrong to try mining and Energy business. We Africans are allowed to do only catering. They took a huge risk! 🙆🏾‍♂️ "Now they have Popo Molefe as Chair Heeeee Banna! She’s lying again! 🙊 @Thando Nkutha Yes 
1:19:16,1:21:43, "Eugene it’s true @Eugene Du Toit .... tat least he had the balls to Fire Gama... But why did Guptas try to take business from our Oubaases?? That was risky! can the so called experts here on the chats section let Barbara Hogan finish her testimony and let Justice Zondo decide if she was speaking the truth or not... "monyane tumelo please tell them lol Nkutha that one was not mistake they were pushing agenda papa but things didn't work out @Thando Nkutha my mistakes never had huge castrophic effects on the whole of the country Why do we have the PFMA? guys help me to understand @Thando Nkutha noo why would it be broadcast if it was ment for zondo only 
1:22:01,1:25:02, "u know i realised something These guys must be arrested maaaan @Sthakathi Khumalo...silly if you ask me... where there is money no one make mistake bra hope this is not only a waste of money but people who are involved should pay back the money and jailed @Thando Nkutha wait until he becomes president... Joseph they answer what they feel is the best without being trapped @lefty twala. No one will pay back the money. and no one will be arrested. Marikana @ Life Esidimeni. No one was arrested 
1:25:35,1:28:49, @Thando Nkutha 51% is all he needs to assume the highest office. Pity we hsve nowhere to run to "but @ eugen y they do so Arrest every1 who still has to testify.....Because it is the Citizens against these shenanigans "by the time these commissions end @Thando Nkutha its his way or the highway Nkutha CIC is from my province n I love him so much but he let me down when he say he will kill for Zuma while they bring our country bto down fall @Thando Nkutha I dont think he will ever do that. i.e. change the tone "As long we still have Mokonyane julius again supporting criminals 
1:28:59,1:32:19, @Agree Thabo can’t understand why Guptas tried to steal big Gvt business from our Oubaases who own 80% of SA wealth. Now see how the landless use all t😌energy & budget to chase 1 family. Bantu Education comedy Hungary Citizens gets hefty jail terms for stealing a 🍞 bread. Evidence???? 🤷🏾‍♂️ "@Thando Nkutha like I said all this parties r criminals what they want to do is to eat tax money Nkaaaandla seems like a drop in the ocean according to all these revelations is better now Mr Ramaphosa came in to fix the mess viva ANC viva yes all the party including SACP receive R3 million from VBS 
1:32:20,1:34:30, Joseph Its when you have something to hide but you not sure to what degree you can disclose the matter without being prosecuted yourself Now will the president fire his brother in law minister Radebe? the plot thickens😕😕😕 "these guys are whistle blowers and can't be implicated in anything or else their evidence is not credible what are going "Was Sunday Times reliable then @Thando Nkutha okay "I don't think so @Noko Mina "We'll recover after 25 full years 
1:34:39,1:36:58, @Thando Nkutha I agree Will the president fire his brother in law???☺☺☺comrades fighting dirty in public Thando as much as I agree I also think coloured people also need the land "Jeff Radebe a has been a minister for 24 years now @Nkutha the issue of land it is problem bra u need to educate people abt the important of land before u take it if u take land for putting Shacks u r not going anywhere boss @Thando Nkutha I concur "Jirrrr what is a ""coloured""" @Thando thanks ok you might feel that way but not all see it like that 
1:38:13,1:42:55, Eugene DT: thats a very important question it is important to take land n use it production but if u want build house rent them out what r u going to buy with money "I wish to see Jeff Radebe's pension people in Zimbabwe they took houses from their own even now they r unable to buy paint to renovate the house I hate it when people say black people need education about land. what education.. blackpeople can work the land. problem is wealthy land is only for select few!! "if I am a DA leader khumalo I'm talking abt what I have saw in free state people fail to run milk farm bra "noko yamebetlwa fair enough bro @Peter Pott how many times did the EFF called for early elections and the dissolvement of this 5th Parliament 
1:42:58,1:45:11, Nkutha is what I see most of the time when people occupied land boss they put shacks State capture is an ANC orchastred scheme that's coming to hunt them... ANC knew what they were doing when replaced Thambo Mbeki with the crook called Msholozi I hope this states captured will bring people in to book not wasting states resources "lol! she retract now. she realizes they are current supporters of CR. They made a public statements agree @Nlisi Nlisi Thole indeed!! @Eslon Eslon true even Cyril himself Banks aren't just going to hand out money @Joseph Thobejane poverty is a bad thing my friend 
1:45:27,1:48:50, @Bryce that's why land is important "@Eugene Du Toit I was more addressing @Nlisi Thole 's point of ""just"" giving land and bank financing" All this lady that is saying is it the truth and nothing else?? An election that will be called tomorrow will be won by the ANC. We are still on this Ramaphoria thing. She stood up to Zuma .....Lyn Brown just rolled over and denied everything.... She's not the best witness but we appreciate her afforts. But she's saying lot of things and seems like she was perfect in her turn. "no Tladi@ maatla those people their earning more salary's than other department "@Desmond - I agree 
1:49:43,1:53:22, she at times forgets she was a minister. she speaks as if she was an outsider. True! Barbara ! "Maybe it's because expected better from her Hey everybody! State capture still on the menu? Yessss L @Marvel Ramatshela & @peter pott. precisely my point. Just hit on question and give straight answer. By the time this is all concluded and there are serious consequences it will be too late Barbara ska idibala please 
1:53:43,1:55:42, @Karabo Qokolo. kwaaaaaaaa..... I also thing wai dibala. @Hlalanathi Mbimbi It may already be to late. Zuma Jr and the Gupta Trio are in Dubai unharmed She's even answering while they still posing a question on her. South Africans don't just only blame Msholozi for the state capture shenanigans but the ANC for knowingly making a corrupt candidate head of state Exactly... state funds going down the drain once again... karabo Qokolo loooool a ska idibala "Tladi wats that fat on her neck 
1:56:00,1:58:33, point taken @Eslon Eslon grow up musa "Enoch resigned as deputy minister @Hlalanathi Mbimbi admittedly her testimony is powerful I guess this should have went to trial not a commission then recommendation to the court @Monique Jones GUPTAS AND DUDUZANE THEY CAN RUN TU DUBAI BUT THEY CANT HIDE BUSY WITH TREATY So much powerful @Monique Jones @zamo Maluka as money talked in SA I'm sure it talks louder and quieter at the same time in Dubai @Tamaryn Petersen .....lol....mybe shes diabetes or high blood pressure...we have an obesity problem in this country 
1:58:43,2:00:15, How does Duduzani go to Dubai given his current unfolding court case of culpable homicide... @Hlalanathi Mbimbi his wife just gave birth there "is she now implicating gwede mantashe now?😀😀go home Barbara "Duduzane is barred from living the country until further notice Uncle Gwede the then SG is in it again @peter pott she created enemies while PE Minister Dj Gweeezy on the decks @Marvel Ramatshela oh ok I must have missed that one. Ohhhh so did he made an application through the court @Monique Jones 
2:00:35,2:03:31, what does her weight have to do with anything? she's making a huge contribution here and you focus on that. shame @Hlalanathi Mbimbi @Marvel Ramatshela said he now can no longer leave the state it was me who stole the taxi money I should rotting in jail by now getting sodomised hahahahah now we waste money n our data listening to this nonsense.y can't u take this to education "Yes @Tamaryn Petersen ....ok....but she needs to work on her weight....including judge zondo by the way we need this money to b invested in free education than commission that has no way suppose you have no faults? no hurry in Africa Barbara. We can wait for 12months. We Waited 27 years for Madiba😀😀 Jeff Hadebe must be fired. 
2:03:33,2:06:08, Transparency to the fees of these commission should be detailed so to know what it means to have members of the state that are incompetent and corrupt to the core... tyrus. that's president brother in law. Sunday lunches might be tense If he fire him @Tamaryn Petersen ....no...no...no....there is no excuse here....people are lazy to just take a 15 min walk 3 times a week Jeff Radebe is a vulture. He is always close to the President (who ever it is) "Ramaphosa I now notice Barbara skin is a bit dry. try Dove soap madam☺☺ 😂😂@Thando Nkutha state capture smells like a factional battle to access resources!! The ANC are really not fit to lead us. We seriously need an alternative and not their graduates called EFF what alternative is there? @Sthakathi Khumalo 
2:06:30,2:07:48, The Zuma Faction ruined this country Sthakathi Khumalo congrats on your comment WATCH THE NUCLEAR DEAL JEFF IS DANGEROUS WITH PATRICE HE IS GOING TO SIGN The ANC @Keryn Well Ramaphosa said he would take his son to jail himself if suspected something was wrong.... so it should not be a problem to merely fire his brother in law My conclusion: Everyone seems to be implicated in state capture except the poor.. that he cnt do i bet @Mbimbi u know the transparency of Zuma before he become president @Hlalanathi Mbimbi true 
2:08:15,2:11:52, Lol Thando He’s just like the Prosecutor in Omotoso Trial 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 What do you mean? @noko yamebetlwa guys don't be much warried about ANC because ANC next year it will become a opposition party 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 @Joseph Thobejane what? "@Timoty - If he can't fire Bathabile "Joseph Thobejane you not wrong  "Hlalanathi Mbimbi To be honest 
2:12:22,2:15:50, Amazing how the malema EFF/ANCYL song has never really changed Are people allow to just linger around while judge is still on Chair? It's annoying hey LETS HAVE FAITH TO CYRIL.LETS SUPPORT HIM @Zamo - Certainly but he mustn't abuse our support as it can be short lived. we need abl we need more actions than warm speeches how can we support cyril because people are loosing their job the lies are crumbling... EVERBODY DURING ZUMA TIME MINISTES ALL OF THEM WERE TOLD TO TOE THE LINE 😎 
2:16:23,2:21:07, @Zamo - but they had a consil they had a constitution and PFMA to guide them. not to take all of Zumas crap "ZUMA IS TO BE BLAME FOR JOBLOSSES IT DID NOT START WITH CYRIL  "They have no excuse to act otherwise The evidence leader is somewhat not the best ALL OF THIS IS MONEY TSHELETE IT DID NOT CROSS THEIR MINDS LIKE DUDUZANE WHEN BB CASK HIM "she now realises. eish! what did I say about my comrades I'll wait for Wednesday to hear what Gordhan has to say "cyril Ramaphosa promise people of south africa more jobs December at nasrec
