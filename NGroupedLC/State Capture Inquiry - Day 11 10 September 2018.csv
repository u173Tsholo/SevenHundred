Great spotting. bless you sweetheart is Tommy Lee Jones involved? lol @ elton John. 
20:15,28:28, At least Shaun abrahamse is no longer the head of NPA. @Paul molane That is what I've always thought. Which is why a joker like Shaun Abrahams suited Zuma like a glove. oh he's a bean counter "Hi guys "@Cool Jazz By appointing the likes of Shaun The cases were investigated abd reffered to NPA which has to decide to prosecute or not.

1:29:46,1:43:22, yeah it was a fake payment all they did is just take the money why would the pay media same amount more than once the entire state needs serious reform but at the same time it's volatile to reform R220 million.. jesus he just said he is not accountant 🤣😂😂🤣Thando a lot of money guptas eege

""we didnt struggle to be poor"" they're a bunch of thugs" @Thando Nkutha yebo i hope SA votes the ANC out of power so we can get our country backup and running its appaling that Cyril didnt know about this 
1:51:16,1:53:22, he must have known Thuma Mina my behind all of them stole and looted Yuuuup the whole ANC caused this Most "I pray for the sake of CR we must vote for him but he is working with wrong people Corruption is a sickness that will affect all in close contact Welcome to South africa a failed state that you can do any thing in and get away with this 
1:53:26,1:54:43, the whole anc did nothing about it... Mmmm I’m so disgusted by Zuma andANC This amount are too big fixing the country they put us back at 1990 "we never had anything then  south Africans better be prepared for the next ZIMBABWE watch this space "money that we'll not be able to recoup who do we vote for come 2019 
1:54:57,1:56:53, is it just mine or is the sound quality bad lol seeing as it is only anc behind all this they must be liable for every cent and return it to us seams like they were using taxpayers money to build their own media enterprise aka propaganda machine "I can't see a future for the country when the state enshrines racist laws and questions property prosecution must happen @ Craig swanepoel.... you can move to the USA I think the constitution needs to be revised all of it "really move to the USA 
1:57:08,1:59:23, "@david jacobs  i want that 42 cents I wish Zuma can come forward and explain this and expose another’s we are tired @Siba Mfabe Correct brother We should rise as South Africa after this corruption has been dealt with "@Siba Mfabe hehehehehe "But we are reliant @Siba Mfabe that's what I'm longing for but I don't know how we can do it! 
1:59:29,2:02:49, we should take our country "@thubalethu  This race attitude of us also need to stop "Thats easy vote the ANC out So far some ANC leaders implicated on corruption but not on behalf of the ANC at least for now. Payments to Infinity and TNA an the manner of it is shocking. They must expose provincials department in future "@ Siba Mfabe at some school where the main war cry had something along the lines of Agelop Race card is a card they dealing to us so that we don't stand united in fighting their corruption What’s the news on the plot to unseat the President???? 
2:03:17,2:09:50, 66m @street....that's how it starts! 😔 Mokoena best answer ever Useless Hawks lol zondo i wonder if Ziza Kodwa sitting at the back were aware of these serious payments ? i mean they all want to sing New Dawn but money was looted during the night before the New dawn "@Tony Pannack akunzima bawo 
2:10:17,2:11:21, Will be interesting when Manyi testify about even payments to Gupta companies from GCIS when he was there as DG. People must pay serious attention to this please 🤔 listen carefully *Zuma voice* "Zizi Kodwa is not taking notes hahaha - listen properly big bugs we talking about yoh "@thubalethu  😂 Like we say here in USA always ...follow the money..and who benefits ... and which political leaders have sold out at the expense of the masses 
2:11:35,2:15:59, Creighton 🤣🤣🤣 pulling a Zuma tendency whats the judgement on the cross examinations? if these monies were used properly S.A would have been much better off @David - You can say that again. now are country us in shambles while the Guptas are dinning in Taipei 101 hotel.. @Marvel Mushavhela True i dont even think they worried about this commision We need a law to prosecute for involvement in fraud btwn Gov and private business that imposes a 20 year fine for 10K and 40 years for 20k per offending party. Amounts musn't change over the years. @Siba Mfabe only jail terms People like Zuma were looting the state in the name of ANC but not for ANC so the ANC is indeed not on trial here so far till evidence come forward that ANC sanctioned those activities 
2:16:15,2:18:55, ANC should be on trial here @Nelson Musoliwa he was the elected leader How much is this commission going to cost us. I heard the venue is costing us R21k/day. More than 6 million a year just for venue he represented both party & country @Marvel for the truth its nothing one day when we look back at our history these years will be the darkest ever recorded watch this space So much money... eish! "@Craig..Can we at least be hopeful for the best? Maybe this commission will bring more hope including those who benefited wrong fully with tenders in local government we know them. 
2:19:50,2:21:45, "This is just the start "Vote ANC Forget about Criminals True that marvel this commission will come out with something better judge zondo need to prove himself so that he can be our next chief justice Wow some big revelations.. tip of the ice berg? Don’t worry about the cost already Bosasa is ready to return R154 or so millions. So the commission will be paid out of looted money. @Craig Swanepoel i think people will be dazed when the actual totals is presented numbers don't lie...if there's still someone saying there is no crime committed under Zuma administration... these amounts are staggering nooooooo more vote for such anc 24 years is enough you were given a chance to mess up around never ever anc in power 2019 is for DA N EFF 
2:21:47,2:23:02, "SA need's there own FBI we want to know the amounts we don't have script @Refiloe Nkabinde were getting there Lets give the DA a chance if they cant turn SA around then we need to go back to the drawing board @Thando Nkutha Yes from other SOE's @Thando yip .. sOE's are drained empty Hey you don't know this people they will still say under Zuma there was wrong happened and no corruption "ANC was trusting Zuma too much and scared to face him "FS=Magashule 
2:23:27,2:24:37, @Mpho Kgomotso Spot on Dude scary stuff.. happened under our noses mpho how do you know because they only mentioned FS and KZN? The Question is who is Backing this... what out side country or countries? what international group have their hands in this as well...you have to think wholistic when your dealing with political @Rudi Crispin Swart the whole country were sleeping only the Zuma faction were awake And i thank Julius Malema for all of this i owe it to him @Mpho Kgomotso ...now go and check out VBS payments.... tells a story... @david jacobs How so? 
2:24:56,2:26:00, Guptas received R 6 000 000 000.00 through China Rail locomotives deal. Tom Moyane then gives them unlawful tax kickback amounting to millions. I can't believe so much money went to 2 stupid brothers All NDZ provinces (premier league) paid the Guptas. when r they coming to testify Julius mentioned these things in Parliament about looting etc @T.S Mokoena - they show an slide on the screen MALEMA HE IS THE ONE WHO OPEN SA PPL EYES ABOUT SO CALLED STATE CAPTURE AND ANC CORRUPTION "@Craig Swanepoel I believe we need a coalition government "@Marvel Mushavhela if those 2 brothers were stupid  "Thuli yes "nonsense it was not malema 
2:26:05,2:26:50, @Bongani Vincent yes indeed Juju went to Thuli yes "I wonder free state as small province Thanks Creighton "Hodgepodge shut up Juju needs to go to jail Dairy project? Those who are doing their best to paint ANC are merely politicking. The process is pointing to corrupt elements who were masquerading as ANC and will help to cleanse rather than condemn it. 
2:26:52,2:29:28, @David - Our ex President is a moron of them all U sick u first go to jail for the what now. Mbalula knew and did nothing to a point i think Zuma wasnt clued up on these 2 brothers @david also think that Minsiter of instagram were to busy on Media chatrooms "Zuma is not implicated as yet "@david jacobs remember it was reported that Zuma told the Guptas to help his son Duduzane as he understands money or something like that @david - then he shouldn't have been President 
2:29:40,2:32:02, @Mpho Kgomotso yes @Creighton Schlebach he was elected as pres true - can't dispute that @Robert Russel leave jullius malema alone if it was not for him you would have never known nothing dont play the man play the ball @Sabelo Sabelo Just like that brother As well as On Point Engineering I guess???? @Robert Russell JujU was cleared on that and he availed himself to go to court so Zupta media is actually government asset I am sure Faithless Muthambi must be thinking about dying now. GCIS for DG's are coming through next. 
2:32:03,2:33:56, "This money could have built all urgently needed school in S.A We will be shocked at the true extent of state capture "Oh and his his 1million """"loan"""" from illegal tobacco gangsters....???" @Marvel yes all of those and change left @david jacobs yes boet why he should go to jail? everybody is corrupt as we speak people are stealing from the public wallet. we still don't know DA sponsors "@Marvel Mushavhela  This figure indicates a million rand is lost every 3 hours from public wallet. 
2:34:22,2:37:38, lol Robert. you people are so eager to find an offense Nomvula Mokonyane is one of the corrupt elements. R2.6 Billion wal @Robert Russell pls man he paid every cent from on point engineering. @ nokwazi shongwe ... so that means your corrupt.. since you stated that “Everyone “ is corrupted... There needs to be checks and balances for everything. Nobody should be able to spend public money without it being transparent. "R.2.6 Billion vanished from the country's purse via Giyani Water project @Sabelo Sabelo ....and where did On Point Engineering get his tax bill and farm from.... plus the mansion in Sandton...????? The phone calls made from public office for our use amounts to corruption. Can we also get payments made to Avusa Media Limited 
2:37:40,2:39:32, we are all corrupt man! "FS paying big bucks to TNA "Nokwazi The falling of Ace continues. Lol where is ratanani trust "T.S Mokoena ace ace "Zuma was protected 9 x in parliament not to step down. now they blame him for the current economic crunch. But they defended him 
2:40:05,2:41:59, Ratanani Trust is dormant Son of the former Premier Magashule was working for Gupta so fs pay in order for ace to get kickbacks @Thando Nkutha Zondo numbers are playing with him Who is Gupta? @Robert Russell yes in that time under zuma but after he was found benefited wrongfully they punished him by taking everything he owned. Wasting time FS - Hello Ace.. How can you explain this mess?? "hahaha ANC looking for unity after theft been done 
2:42:29,2:44:04, "@A.A. DOS LOBITOS Google ""state capture south africa""" Unity through silver bullets.. It's not going to wokr "I think many people need to come and give their evidence in regards this room is always in fire Ace is in very hot water yet CR 17 does nothing Exactly @David and not just ACe others too "Ace is certainly going to be summoned to come here we dont want that corrupt ACE 
2:44:16,2:46:06, FS administration(1) =No service delivery(0) +(1) increased looting of public finds.. I think CR is just waiting for next election thereafter he might do some JZ cabinet and select his new cabinet. @david jacobs "Oh well Ace was elected by delegates "He must come and testify reshuffle cabinet @Desmond Masilela Cyril is president im not too sure he will be pres come 2019 too much for him too absorb so ANC cannot suspend people because they were voted in but we are not a constituency democracy? ACE is not holy i tell you. "still have Gigaba and Bathabile 
2:46:13,2:47:58, True david jacbs and faith muthambi Cyril is business And Bathabile drunk "Desmond Masisela Ramaphosa is not a stupid guy won’t do that coz there is records after wasting money so if doing that he has to answer All DGs and CFOs of all departments must come and testify. "@david jacobs He should have done something already 
2:48:06,2:49:45, Agree with Marvel @Desmond Masilela the problem is that CR doesnt do anything "don""t forget Mosebenzi Zwane" "if one is implicated  That crook @Lucky123 Thwala That man is skelm you ca hear it in his voice All the CR comments are without foundation... you have to know it's the ANC before the Country.... that's why he has done nothing. Lol "They (DGs and CFOs) are the ones who need his to this point 
2:50:15,2:52:16, Lol agreed with you Twala that one he must come really Tom Moyane is a bird from another stock yoh yoh yoh im sure Tom & Zwane are related phew "Moyane is a joke What did these guy do in the ANC @david jacobs. In my view David I think the man (CR) is waiting for next year to elect his new cabinet. "Tom aaah mara Zondo n numbers 
2:53:07,2:56:26, "Cyril must reshuffle now @Desmond Masilela then he should listen to this commission to be taken seriously as this will hang on his doorpost come 2019 So the judge want to tell me that when his finish with this witness is over for today? he only started 10:00am and he wants to finish now at 13:30? it cant be. "@Mokoena - Numbers will humble you Shame our best president CR has carryover all Zuma budon in his shoulder it is not on guys 😁😁😁 @david jacobs. "lol but Maleka has already established the amount was 5.6 million I don’t feel sorry for CR bcos when all of this happened he was there. "He was there as Deputy president 
2:56:51,2:59:38, Zondo applied for a 24 month extension so he can work half days...... and charge the Tax payer 280 Million... for the pleasure of his company. But I do agree with you @marvel "I hope Manyi has bought new shoes this time. Cyril was there all the time You correct @Tiny Nontulo. He was there and he did nothing. even when Malema raised all these in Parliament they all kept quite. Yes hence I’m not surprised that he is still working with a corrupt cabinet. I don’t see him reshuffling them It doesn't matter where CR is the president or not. I think he also need to come and testify. Nontulo nothing you can do alone many people with majority surounded president and hawks and NPA was control by Zuma and all branches of the ANC in favor of Zuma what else you may do its true makhosi. Jocob Zuma was a disaster. he had now honest intensions with his presidency. now he wants to put together groups to overthrow Cyril. he will fail. he had the opportunity to serve SA. Can you also say CR is responsible and complicit in the meeting that Ace held with Zuma because CR is in the same leadership with Ace? 
3:00:27,3:03:55, "@Desmond Masilela  "if Cyril was serious about corruption during Zuma administration @Nokwazi Shongwe the beauty of democracy must also put you in jail if you corrupt like these guys Zondo wont have question I think his hungry now. Zondo is South AFrica's Barry White He should try singing "@Nokwazi Shongwe sorry you wrong.... """"WE"""" don't a point a person to fill a roll in Government... we vote for a party and that is where the problem lies..." yes people are going to go to jail "@Marvel Mushavhela  
3:04:21,3:06:04, @Siba Mfabe Eish Eish..I guess you are right . hi i am back today i will only speak to human beings n not to Bantus we would nt have had the funds to have this commission Are we going to hear the judge handing the judgement for the Guptas and Associates? He said sometime this week.@Thando Nkutha Mushavhela you can’t do that just leave someone who run away is cowards if he did that Zuma was going to have more control and we can now have another Zuma such as Dlamini-zuma to defend him 
3:06:21,3:09:42, But he could have at least make noise about it than to keep quiet "@david jacobs  "Robert Russell bantus are 3/5 human beings and trim at forehead "Ahg..Is he not done with the judgement Time will tell Thando R21000 for today is gone "kill the bantu 
3:10:05,3:12:03, "@Fils de l'homme  someone block this stupid with the long eyebrow combed over his bles Block him "@david Then ANC would lose elections which is not a bad thing Agree with Nkabinde "Siba Mfabe kill the bantu awy awu the tsotsie Fils is more like a devil in church
