He went around SOEs enabling state capture. DC has it absolutely right. Dr Ngubane is IFP or ANC? @Sherwin Peters I don't think so. I think family watching the stream read our comments. "He is ANC "Dr. Ben Ngubane was IFP 
1:43:08,1:45:07, Someone very senior on the board. Perhaps the chairman? 😉😂😂😂😂😂 Gordon Nefdt ANC My opinion is that it was him feeding Mr. Howa and Esa what the board was going to decide. Why he left IFP???? m late today Mmmmm...the money looked greener on the ANC side.........heheh @Fred Desrosiers Or the other way around.. i think Chair has that thing that can pursued a person to telling the truth😁😁😁 they must go down

2:03:37,2:05:01, lol lost for words with the help of these scumbags that wanted their right to pilfer and steal the issue to me is that this witness was doing side business with the Guptas and sitting here not admitting he was the one feeding the Guptas with info @wim louw 😂 It is really shameful for people who are earning a lot of money but go on doing these bad deeds and claim to be christians.. Handling of the Board? @ Fred seleka is coming to that just watch Fred u r spot on Anybody knows latests if Jacob Zuma will appear before Commission again? 
2:05:02,2:06:16, spot on "Comedy Hour lol too much money they never saw that much money in their lives and he also defended Brian Molefe to the hilt @Fred they were called the Gupta board and they denied that @Gordon Nefdt Zuma has been summonsed to appear before DCJ early in November. JZ is appearing on the 16th of Nov 16 to 20 Nov @Fred that's the SABC matter this is about getting Gupta agents into Eskom 
2:06:32,2:07:27, 16th to 20th of November Zuma's date to appear zuma will fall sick on the 16th. so we will have 4days of lies and evasion of question Mkmva will stop Zuma to appear they already vow to disrupt the appearing of 16-20 November we just have to wait and see if he will come "@Naledi Barron Hi Precious. Whether he appears Judge Zondo intervenes too much! He talks too much! Nkubani Zuma will testify via video link but we'll have loadshedding

The so-called liberation movements are a disgrace. Is this what was fought for?? It is the same pattern in the whole of SADC. Shame ANC shame! agreed @Mzala 
2:10:42,2:11:51, DCJ interrupts too much and seem to deliberately derail Adv Seleka's momentum Has chairman directly addressed the recusal issue? issac that is the politics of Africa the attitude has changed now because they aware this commission is not childs play they can be arrested. they must ask Sodi imesi igobele esandleni I notice that too @Karabo T adv slk wil destroy dis DR @Blake Yogi no it is time that voters are to make an informed decisions when voting. @melds Why not? 
2:12:10,2:13:04, lol Selekaaaa!😋😋😋They having a feast But this time I think he have no chance "Diana "the DCJ is an Apex Court justice @Karabo meaning Chair has an agenda? @Blake Yogi probably does not want to entertain stupidity @Sherwin agreed Chair is calling adv nicely "@Diana Sekatane Sadly Dear

2:14:54,2:15:59, Dr. Ngubane looks like JZ to me Steve this is really sad.. @Steve Lamb I concur! Bazinga Advocate Seleka!! he was put into that position by them @buyani ...he does not read newspaper clippings? but does the Minister decide who becomes Chair? @maneer Steve lamp whu going to get food parcel ♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️♦️ yhoo this thing of I don't know yerrr 😂😂😂

2:16:46,2:18:13, 😂 Businessman 😱😱😱 stop with the jokes... Theres the link somma here it comes again................businessman What have I missed since we started? Was watching an interview with Stormy Daniels on Trump and only finished it now There was no media statement businessman Salem Essa so its the Board and then the Minister must rubberstamp unless they have serious objection 
2:18:42,2:20:57, End questioning now...going in circles @Warren Manning correct "I don't know @Warren Exactly🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️ cool thanks 👍🏾 In this corrupt deeds the Sam Holdings was also implicated becoz he was in coal supplies to Tageta "@greatnation69 But how can we? All our Great Nation has left surely they can follow the ip address of businessman?? "supreme kennedy zuma is in deep problem why now he is having issues with chair  
2:22:34,2:24:16, @rohan barnard Thinking of emigrating.. and helping America Great again? Just asking always wondered who those people were who attended the TNA breakfasts @ Gordon Nefdt. Not only going around in circles but also a huge amount of repetition and very complicated method of questioning? This was real capturing @Brian. ...Yes why are they re-reading this! Guptas were ahead of events New Age has always been funded by Guptas Great point chair 
2:24:17,2:25:49, @Brian ​@ Gordon Building a spider's web slowly lol he is blaming others 😋😋😋 @ Willie. Painfully slowly hahahha he is alluding to him being captured too @Mbuyiseli Mtshitshi TNA funded by tax payers money not the Guptas. "Dr. Ngubane is a criminal arrest the fellow @willie ....this is not a court of law..Judge can decide on balance of probabilities @Mbuyiseli Mtshitshi They owned New Age! How old are you? 
2:25:58,2:27:55, He has confirmed the capture "his doctorate must be taken after all this nonsense "The Guptas never used their own money. Always tax payers money @levy manaka He is a medical doctor The ambassador Sekgololo you are so...so..Wright he is a CRIMINAL finish and klaar Doc Ngubane 🤞🤞🤝 Toordokter Exactly what I want to push @ levy manaka Is Dr still OK? 
2:28:06,2:28:55, 🙄🙄what kind of doctor is this one ♦️useless Businessman his certificate like Masuku be nullified toordokter judge decides on beyond reasonable doubt not balance of probability They must simply go to Jail @levy manaka he is medical doctor that practiced in apartheid. "this crook is smooth  he can't keep on saying he doesn't know or he doesn't not remember 🤚🤚🤭😂😂😅🤣 
2:29:04,2:30:47, anc is the problem Levy greed knows no colour gender and otherwise education. DCJ is tired... his is a groot skelem finish and klaar👌👌👌 He knows that email address is Salim Is Dr Ngubane still adamant that Businessman was not Salim Essa? ngubanecrook how do you get a medical Dr on a board of a utility company.. madness just! These witnesses are trying to run out the time of the commission 
2:30:58,2:31:43, He is a ruthless politician Dr of SOEs corruption this doctor brings shame to his family. Suzan Daniels has confirmed that Business man is Salim Essa Just follow the money and do life style audits on these cheesy characters Surely he cannot be a Dr of Medicine We can watch this comm till dooms day there will be NO jail time for anyone. This is just a smoke screen for the ANC to save face.Its more a marketing ploy. Should publish photos of all those who attended TNA breakfasts at SABC. @Gordon Nefdt the commission can only do recommendations not decisions 
2:31:47,2:33:30, He is a medical doctor to late to explain to him chair this ngubane knew what he was doing @Steve Lamb apparently he is a medical dr "@Pheladi Lamola Of course he knows "He graduated MB ChB in 1971 from the Medical School of the University of Natal "@Person of interest I lost track of time 😅 I opened up a second youtube tab 👍🏾 🤦‍♂️😂 he must have been high on morphine then when he was busy looting 
2:33:41,2:34:38, I love love love DCJ Zondo!!! So incredibly sharp!! Bring Ms Daniels back He has sweets in his pocket slk making progress I wonder if they all shop online at loot . co . za Melrose arch...as far from free state.. In 1991: Minister of Health in the KwaZulu government "Is Stormy part of this commission too? 🤣🤣🤣 I heard Ms. Daniels 😛 (Yes ANd now IO've got a secret crush on Adv Seleka!! 
2:34:38,2:35:34, he started well and was with Buthelezi at IFP but now I don't know.. @ Keagan. I never cease to be amazed that more life style audits are not being done especially among politicians? when i hear the chair remembering stuff i feel ashamed coz i dont even remem my kids birthdays at times Dr Nkubani conceded 😂🤣😂 @Naledi Barron Not so secret 🙂 Roza essack just killed me @Naledi Barron :virtualhug::virtualhug::virtualhug::virtualhug::virtualhug: "The one thing i have noticed in South Africa 
2:35:35,2:36:06, Lifestyle Audits are a waste of time @Tommygun Shhhhhhhhh! LOL! My Crush is Ms Mbanjwa 🤣 "He graduated MB ChB in 1971 from the Medical School of the University of Natal The arrogant Ben Ngubane is slowly coming back. @rohan our Ms Daniel's not as unclothed as Trumps ms d @Roza essack 🤣🤣🤣 I can't even remember my own birthday @Diana Sekatane I never heard that he left the IFP and joined another party Mafokatla😁😁😁 
2:36:10,2:37:42, @Person of interest 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @Roza he is amazing a ninja superhero🤗 grilling begins now 😁😁😁😁😁 He was appointed as an ambassador.. why isnt the Brown letter attached to his affidavit @Tommygun SO THATS NOT TOO BAD FOR APARTHEID!!! @Derek Govander you surely can't be suggesting that apartheid wasn't that bad? Deputy Chief Justice is on the ball but you can see the Doc is lost and can't answer or remember please ......this guy o se ye tsa i naye🤭🤭🤭😱tjo 
2:37:49,2:38:35, @Derek Govender please do not defend apartheid. It was a crime against humanity. I Ms Mbanjwa is is mbanje or weed in English I do feel the Dr should just admit. it is so clear he was being used. @Derek Govender benefitted from apartheid @ncube exactly what i mean The real problem is that the average ANC card carrying member never hold their ministers to account ... @Tay Ms. Mganja 😅 @Derek Govender black people were allowed studying medicine at the time "@Lungisani Ntshonga yes 
2:38:38,2:39:40, @Rohan what has changed Crime against Humanity vs this ANC Genocide "@Derek Govender you are poor and not rich @Mzala how so I think one of the recommendation from this commission should be that all board members must be vetted by a parliament and they are ask what skill set they will bring to the board before appointment and also gives the public a chance to point inaccuracies in their CVs @Yolo thnx cc tay im sure mbanjwa is weed😁😁 Only beneficiaries of apartheid can defend it. 
2:40:00,2:40:54, "just shocking how so much corruption has taken place Hello everone. The guptas must be extradited and give their version of events. where are u guys? "If the parliament can change the voting system yes agree with that @Khanyi. AgeGracefully Lady K!! GTSY! "You are lucky its still the ANC in power @Lungisani Ntshonga pleasure 
2:41:07,2:42:07, @Keagan Michel .....mmmmmm...lets just say that it's easy to brainwash the average supporter etc etc....... Hi @Khanyi. AgeGracefully Derek is trying to defend apartheid 🤐🙄🤔 Lady Naledi 🤗🤗🤗😍 lol Is DJZ giving us his final report now already? @Diana Sekatane Exactly! And therein lies the problem! @Brian...Yes :o @kiss the boer. i love violence.so yeah am all ready wat actually happening in Johannesburg 
2:42:07,2:43:41, Khanyi how are you? Mr Zondo is doing fantastic work.. Listen to what @Kiss The Boer Rac!st KILLA is saying. :socialdist::socialdist::socialdist: Guptas were behind all this mess. when brought back they may have to be thrown into jail and all keys thrown away to sink under the deepest sea. Did Brian pay back the money? Dr Ngubane doesn't care. DCJ is just wasting his time and energy What Money Mandela killed South Africa when he introduced Guptas to South Africans... 
2:43:45,2:44:14, people who defend aparthied are like those who tell you how to feel when you have lost your child or a loved one.... the nerve.🤮🤮 @ Kiss The Boer Rac!st KILLA are you calling me a racist? The Guptas knew how capture and who to capture I'm sure the Guptas were equally cheer leader'd on by those who benefited from all the looting @Arthur ...I don't think so. i think he said he had spent it already. @Arthur Nieklaassen no brian wont pay it "@joyce tendai Zvavareyi My personal preference would be for all the Gupta gangsers be lined up against a wall dereck you don't belong to this chat please behave Zondo already understands the agenda. 
2:44:40,2:45:15, naledi today i agree with u on the guptas What exactly did the Guptas do wrong? @Person of interest Oh yes!! DCJ is superb!! Yes racist @Gerard Victor and there is nothing you can do about it "Our own was a gangster state @Roza essack xx @kanyi tell me wat this new dispensation has done for u or the multi million thats still suffering if not are in a worse situation!!!??? @Kiss The Boer Rac!st KILLA EFF cant even beat themselves outta a plastic bag Mr.Zondo drawing the picture 
2:45:19,2:46:13, Blaming the Guptas is the most common excuse. Jail the scum that succumb to the temptation @Eddie Reddy how so? The pressure exerted seems to be very undue to the elite politicians hence they want Zondo recused 🤣🤣🤣 we are slowly reaching the boiling point. when are this self made millionaires put behind bars aha Tsotsi😊 Tell us Mr Ngubane The smell of 🦌 is heavy on the chat HAMBONYELA LE KUDE @Gerard Victor Thetha Oom Ben thetha nje wena 
2:46:15,2:46:41, DCJ is great-intelliget logic and memory! An asset that we need. Maybe he should be asked so serve at Intelligence! Guptas had a massive gravy train ! Blaming Tsotsi as usual @ Yolo dr Ben will be implicated in CDJ s report I salute Gupta's. they found cattles in south Africa in government n turned them to become their own goat's. I salute them. He is still lying "Even If all the stolen money is ever repatriated @Arthur Nieklaassen nice blue trains 😅 PRASA style Tsotsi is seen as clean but not according to Ngubanes😂 
2:46:54,2:47:43, Spill the beans....Bad Doctoer....come on....... Mr Jonas loved Sunday City "DCJ is over the target Liar Sun City "Extradition on the Guptas should spice this show up!😂🙌🏽 they don't like you zondo because you keep opening they files little by little & slowly but sure. They spent enough now in our country we talk we laugh we give our opinions and we welcome all people last nite i was watching a overseas channel nd it was disgusting that people cant even voice their opinions Jonas lied under oath I have no doubt. my name starts with a capital letter K.. Derick 
2:47:58,2:49:14, "how do these people feel knowing that the Guptas are protected in Dubai and they are facing the music alone in SA rohan i smell him to Yolo you can't say that.Ngubane tells what happened unless you know something please share with the commission Yes Michael look at the PPE'S Why has the CCMA dragged these matters? Tell him my Queen K not k they are corrupt too True! @khanyi but the K word is a bad word ne.hence small letter

One's personal name is important to that individual CCMA conifer with employer to destroy poor and marginalized workers after lunch is going to 💥💥💥 Noun is always start with a Capital letter 
2:50:55,2:51:50, All the departments were very active when it comes to tenders but very lenient on criminal matters @Arthur Nieklaassen Gupta board must all go to jail. Bloody thugs. Yolo More brother "@Sabelo Nxumalo Derek Govender you and Gerard Victor you forget very quick what you white did to blacks what happenned to 339Billion that was stolen by racist white man... Why Koko was brought back? "You want to make a liar mad what happened with our chats now? "That's what China has done at the school level

Cowards!!!!!! * All these board persons thaught they were important. @khanyi how so.i was worse than you in fact Like you get White Monopoly Capital? you get Black Corruption Capital? Get to the point oupa the Guptas were doing the same thing Ruperts are doing at the moment n nobody makes a fuss about it 
2:54:32,2:55:56, "@Giovanni Redcliffe  the most dangerous liars are the ones who think they are telling the truth @Sabelo Nxumalo 😂wow ok Gala except others are doing it for media praise and for bread and others for their lives @Yolo More wish i was a liar Don't fight over who suffered more.

I don't trust media reporting because it always pushes certain narrative he's relaying the script from his attorney before he forgets. Slow Poison can't wait to question this fool Lunch time Zondo and its in your pay grade? @Christopher Peters 
2:57:54,2:58:50, How can they man justify the stealing of the county's resources? Hey Fellow SA's. Please lets not get distracted. We are here to support the State capture in exposing the rot. Lets not fight amongst ourselves. Because that is what the enemy wants see the chair is speculating. Kyk hie horie djy jou ma se. @Kiss The Boer Rac!st KILLA TY @FieliesSA ! Aaaah?
