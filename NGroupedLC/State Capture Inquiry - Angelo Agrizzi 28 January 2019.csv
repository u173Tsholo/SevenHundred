Sorry Guys......ANC supported all the corruption....they knew ALL about it... it's all about ANC those who say otherwise are either in denial or brainless 
53:03,54:30, refusing to vote is basically same as saying no vote if not ANC. punish them and vote another party duuh """That is correct """ VOTE 🍉🐒 individuals at anc gonna come and explain themself.no blanket Who is the ANC @MIKE LOCK ? "Some people working the organisation called ANC knew  Thanks Wavy u have the facts correct @Sindisi...the Party Bra ...what they stand for etc anc officials were bribed. there are no opposition officials. individuals are of ANC 
54:33,56:41, "ANC is not individuals  "Corruption was first institutionalised inside the ANC @nkosinathi. no. south Africa we don't do that. we love courts of law. there is one law firm offering their services to Watson as this fellow speak. Barry roux welcomed Oscar's case to make that e.g EFF THINK AGAIN. Makwa thank you Zola this country is governed by ANC NOT national unity Individuals go into the ANC mostly clean but get corrupted by institutional culture of the party gangster party this time they will 
56:55,58:26, hence EFF leaders would find it hard to be corruption free because they were raised in the hotbed of corruption ANC Guys....I say again...ANC/EFF have communist agenda's......think about it ppl not voting only secures the ANC The father of of ANC was found corruption many times even Ramaphosa received money from Bosasa Mike... the 80% do NOT want capitalism. stop the arrogance lets wait for court to find her guilty.but you have a point "@Zolani Mnqika basically it's okay for anc members to steal groceries from the correctional service in fact ANC used to canvass membership on a basis that it is a ticket to state resources Chair I do not trust myself 
58:36,59:30, Linda Mti right? "David if undo not vote for a different partt the EFF's cardinal pillars are Marxist ideology which has been responsible for HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of deaths across the globe.. anyone with an internet connection can discredit them in 10min Bosasa itself was founded by ANC veterans among we count Mapisa Ngqakula today is Angelo's 8th day @ Bronx.........afraid 80% are totally brainwashed.......capitalism is the Lesser of All the evils..... . m m 
59:51,1:01:18, Gavin Watson & his brothers were ANC activists in apartheid years boom @bronx it is only because you have absolutely no idea what your options are and how each of these systems work that you don't want capitalism. dan wt Bosasa is ANC corruption machine makwa no 80 don't want it... 7 percent minority will not dictate what others want @playboy Bosasa was formed by ANC veteran Cele i fully agree 
1:01:38,1:02:18, 80% "EFF is not Marxist Ramaphisa sellout.no no no @Bronx ....you are so wrong my Bra......... "i don't trust this ramaphosa guy what nonsense is marxist-fanonian- sankarist ideology @makwa ame to that m'fo Phala y ..You are 
1:02:39,1:03:36, @ Frans.....he is cut from the same ANC cloth.... do you see the guy at the back of everyone 😂😂😂 EFF is a fascist quasi revolutionary force "Ramaphosa is from ANC they are cooked in same pot Cele Ramaphosa. i still have confidence in Ramaphosa Zwandile!!!! skejana correct who will trust a guy who killed peoples in marikana for wage disput 
1:03:44,1:04:26, So IDT was part of this whole enterprise. RamaBosasa @bronx I agree fully! because the 80% will rather have 100% of 10 than 10% of a billion. sebola he never did David cele you think malema cares about you.. do you see him getting a 9 to 5.. scary to see people willing to give there vote to a guy who's words hold no water.. "if you have confidence in Ramaphosa it means you also truly believe in the ANC ok playboy. so be it Ramboy this is ANC institutional tradition on display 
1:04:32,1:06:41, Hi Guys Just tuned in what did i miss? Ramaphosa is not ANC Thanks Granny ur my president "I was still dodging bullets on Twitter via #Taxrevolt Malema is just a populist who would do anything to keep his stomach full he is only the Anc President and former leader of government business what's wrong with that Thanks Michael 
1:07:11,1:09:25, the EFF would be better with Ndlozi at the helm & without both Floyd & Julius so if hi did not kill them y is hi compersating them for what cos his a killer and a thief arrogance and capitalism despise African dominance. or any indigenous for that matter. they will call it any by-word negatively expressed by THEIR standard Cele disagree There is no Poloticians or political parties that is going to salvage blacks because the general masses of blacks don't understand polotics and that works in the interest of Poloticians and parties Geees...those who are voting for commies really don't know what they are in for....total disaster. "Floyd & Julius were baptised in ANC corruption Cele is Malema still owe SARS "communism is your fear word. whatever you deem them 
1:09:31,1:10:43, "the 80% votes according to popular opinion about what people tell them right before elections Masipa.. 👍 which party gonna make us rich. @ Bronx....you got no idea my Bro....... pb stfu.. 80 have 400+ years to know what they eat I haven'tet an economically literate person (someone who understands where money comes from and how the global financial system works) who said they will vote EFF and many will still be poor under EFF "@Masipa I agree with you to some extent want* 
1:10:44,1:13:20, "@Tebogo V they have tasted corruption money and the want more hence they ""started a new party"" if they really did start a new party" @ Bronx....want.....don't always get... irony. nobody said they will be rich from the land or EFF governance. only the racist hyenas keep repeating that childish narrative Multi party democracy encourages fragmentation of the political space as each one attempts to feed their own stomach @bronx the people want it because they have absolutely NO idea what it is. if you took 30 min to lightly research what it is (AND have the capacity to understand what you're reading) you would RUN Mmusi reminds me of Madiba pb you sound like a ANN7 person no sense But...they are Revolutionaries and Commies.. 
1:13:32,1:15:16, notwithstanding that elections become a financial contest of those with deeper pockets not who has better policies or could govern better "This man is brave he is useless Dlamini correct how many parties do we have in SA today? EFF=HOOLIGANS Tebogo think 570. Cassius agree. hooligans disrupting African nepotism and white privilege 
1:15:27,1:18:06, Eff is not fit to hold office bunch of kids hooligans with degrees "@Tebogo V They know all the ins and outs of corruption "If the progressive forces are all pursuing a genuine struggle of economic justice for the majority "JUST IMAGINE HOOLIGANS WITH DEGREES free yourself they saved this country from flattening free yourself. go to Australia 
1:18:31,1:22:32, Remember corruption is an individual choice YES "stop being a BLACK dude what r u saying?? Let them send an invoice they should be paid for snitching ... doesn’t mean they fit to hold office "because then you are dependant on them! not yourself. you aren't a BLACK "Being black doesn't mean ur nothing Why do you think eff is ready to hold office if I may ask. 5 years EFF has done much without power than 25 yrs of ANC in power 
1:23:11,1:25:50, DA are still Apartheid's grandson Have you seen how many rdp house being built around Roads being paved "don't panic. EFF are just being confident "@bronx with one breath you reject the ANC What EFF done @ Bronx Wavy i didn't say DA is white @Khakhathi Mulaudzi stole the pensions from lots of poor people? smell the coffee Khak 
1:26:10,1:28:03, Jack..... bruh I just registered to vote the EFF... YESSS "@bronx again if you are white you can still vote EFF like the color of your skin is all that matters. why whats wrong with white voting EFF... you are such a grandstander @david cele helped themselves to the money of many poor people... hypocrite I believe we should let the 80% vote EFF and leave them to their own demise.. if you wanna keep voting for idiotic ideology you deserve to suffer "Jack where are you getting this""info""" Aaand were back!😀 
1:28:15,1:29:41, @Bronx Wavy not from twitter that helps and CIC Malema has warned us there is allot of suffering coming for us to take the land and give it all to government and lease the land from them We should expect more from our leaders. We shouldn't vote for the ones who stole the least money. We should vote those who steal out completely no report implicates EFF. @david cele try think for yourself @bronx becuase they a drop in the ocean "@david cele they will. malema will be charged think for yourself he says. a riddle and not an answer. a thirsty hyena wanting to implicate EFF 
1:30:29,1:31:46, "EFF and ANC are same thing Terry Motau's report? Or is that too WMC!!!!!! for you we know the reason why white people in their majority don't support the EFF "Bongani Fuzile and ""Bongs""" How were these bribes recorded in the financial statements? @Nicodimus Mojela​ because the cockroach in charge threatens to kill them all? pb69 who is your party??? you are in a criticizing mood today Phela voting the EFF is a threat to white privilege and supremacy lol who taught you about WMC? the very same people who sell out your rights and services and take bribes from WMC 
1:31:56,1:34:19, WMC!!!!!!! idiot thanks David..maybe the corruption they refer to is failing to pay Afriforum court fees😂😂 Malema has nothing to loose becuase his things were auctioned off to the public that is the only power malema has EFF are guilty. they failed to pay the court fees of Afriforum😂😂 voting for EFF is not a threat to whites only but the country Bull It’s like putting Donald trump pb69 stop spinning... what is YOUR party? I know my question 
1:34:19,1:35:08, The EFFwill never pay that nonsense Facts matter Emotions aside @Nicodimus Mojela yes they will "We are back in session you are playing EFF wont Govern this country as long as I am Alive These politicians all protect each other - even across party lines. It is naive to think there are one honourable person among them. @bronx you mention afriforum but you don't even know who they are or what they do. all you know is your leaders (who are robbing you blind) tell you they are WHITES and you are BLACK. and you listen. 
1:36:00,1:37:31, okay pb.. you dodge my question and repeatedly attempt to think for me now I motion for a block party on you white corruptions and black corruptions is all bad for our country. we need leaders with integrity to lead us. All corrupt people should be arrested and throw the key away. vote BLF 2019 block playboy666 @Paul...spot on Bro.. mngomezullu EFF already started to run the country you are to late. "Clearly 1) projects financed the bribe money 2) PAYE was not paid on persons bribed 3) money laundering was applied to obtain cash 4 ) invoices were modified in account for cash received "@bronx I do not have a party. I vote DA because I believe that they are not YET as corrupt as the rest. and evidence shows where they govern 
1:37:33,1:39:12, BLF is five kids and a laptop Paul its fine. give EFF your vote and your confidence @Paul mufhad yes @bronx blocking someone who has a different opinion is the opposite of intelegence. I dont trust EFF at all What’s blf? Guys...the EFF has a commie agenda.....think about it..... what do they do "EFF can't govern this country  
1:39:45,1:40:54, I have to seriously think about EFF BLF are the curruptable party that racist purposely confuse for EFF It's the same with BLF....commie agenda...think about it.... EFF offers Busary for learners completed matric and want to further their studies this year.. EFF is still far from governing a country. Its still baby steps for them and they need to mature I don't trust EFF at all capitalism doesn't work for a cup try like SA its a reality we are viting the EFF 
1:40:55,1:42:17, @sipho cebo At this moment I hardly think any party can be trusted in South Africa havent heard one person here mention polocies or substance. because unfortunately people do not have the mental capacity. they vote based on what these people tell them. not their own agency/ research Yah hey .. you are right there @Kids Collie i heard EFF members through locals off a bus in polokwane.. because why ??? Dj Black coffee offers bursary for poor matriculated people does it mean he can be president? EFF is currently changing policies of the country.Is governing. better life .. now thats funny EFF is the only political party in South Africa making sense UDM is okay. 
1:42:29,1:43:12, Cope "@Nicodimus Mojela to you @LJEE noooooooooooooo you can say that agaain Nico I know the movement of the EFF ..

You never had any land racists make white ppl look bad Ramaphosa campaigned with corrupt money from osasa Bosasa talking nonfacts all emotions to those unemployed and still defending ANC... your unemployment relationship will be a long lasting one😂😂😂😂.

I will put it to you that you have idea what you are talking about no idea bronx you right @kids it's a very well substantiated scientific argument to which you respond with insults instead of intelegent debate. you argue the man not the argument the Zupta clan gets more buck for their bang They claim to know nothing and yet they were there zupta took over and they did nothing. The da is just a white party which perpetuates white privilege and black exploitation 
1:52:37,1:54:14, What has EFF done for you "@Bronx Wavy we have no need to block Playboy..we have no hidden agenda  Maimane is controlled by his white wife an he is busy misleading our desperate lost souls "the sad thing is your mind emediately reverts back to racist you people 😂 Maimane was in the movie get out. He was in the auction being sold for his smile @Nicodimus Mojela racist comments from a black supremacist These zupta cronies must kiss my vote away.

They have no economic understanding "@nicodimus it's because you believe that people are ""given"". these ""whites"" you speak of font wait to be ""given"" anything ANC understanding is Steal steal steal this corruption is killing the future of our children 
2:00:40,2:02:16, Bronx your out of line slightly steer back into .. the world doesn't vote but us as South AFrican citizen are going to "so each individual does their best to contribute and build a better place. there is no ""given""."

What’s vf? Out of 26 institutions of higher learning the EFF is in charge of 20 Initials of a person? The EFF will surprise you 
2:05:29,2:06:30, maybe we need our own state so that you can build your wakanda I can hear her nervously breathing from here @Nicodimus Mojela That's because kids like EFF.

2:23:42,2:25:41, Unreached if Agrizzi implicates 1 more ANC member then they are officially on trial lol "i see nosiviwe mapisa-nqakula has made confessions to newspapers I've raised serious facts and logical arguments. all I've heard are emotive attacks on me and people swearing they will vote a certain based on nothing but what they are told by people in power. Rori any update about Steirhoff angels with horns and devils with halos.... that's how things have become... we rely of crooks like Agrizzi to give us the truth about worse crooks who pretend to be angels for our votes. SABC can you please update us what is the status? because we have a tribal culture and our leaders preach nothing but you are a mindless BLACK instead of an individual who can make up his mind based on facts. Rori is she in jail now. 
2:26:05,2:29:02, 9Play9Boy9.. Remember we were slaves the time we were not ruling ourselves and please note that not all Black Leaders are bad Leaders like ANC corrupt crew.. We must just give EFF a chance to rule. So they decide to cut off the news feed. would be nice for SABC to interact in the chat @vision we were sold as slaves to the west by ELITE BLACKS. they didn't come and capture free people. they came to BUY slaves I see that Rhamaposa sees this commission as a trough and reconciliation exercise - there will be no consequences for and corrupt person. Only a spanky spanky on the fingers - don't be so naughty. "south africa was a better place under apartheid lol. Enca chats.. jus saying👀 "this is SABC For I a better place for whom exactly?

Sell SAA to Virgin airlines or somebody else who are interested etc etc 
2:35:36,2:37:01, Without BBBEE no black owned business will survive. We need laws that prohibit government officials of conducting business. The should just be allowed to do their job I have lost faith in my people. whe will always choose to be the oppressed rather than the Victor's. we will choose to be BLACK rather than individual people. Dinner is millions 😳😳 Europe is Africa. look at any pre 1600 map the bloodsuckers need natives to survive blacks walk barefeet on white man's resources. @kids we have the entire English common law. there are laws like that. the problem is the people who are suppose to implement and enforce these laws are stealing corrupt incompetent and uncaring. you're sick

Mashaba" let's wait till after the elections and c who does not have a country remember when she was shouting in Parliament about the doors😂 ignore this Rory she's gonna explode in the hotseat @thami he is allowed becauz free speach is vital to a scoceity. if want to live a free and fair scoceity you cannot disallow someone to raise points you don't agree with.research how free speach works "so this ""foundation""is for cleaning the dirty money really...?" 
2:49:15,2:51:04, you cannot claim free speach and then disallow people. even if they are trolling. report that hyena also is it Agrizzi loyal or betrayal? best thing you can do is challenge his points logically or ignore him. DUDU ZUMA MYENI IS AGAIN IMPLICATED....LOL "9play9boy9. Rori is not raising points alas. I'm out. it's very tiring to try and convince people they are individuals with potential when our leaders work overtime to teach BLACKS and WHITES. leave rory alone and continue with the conversation "KZN 
2:51:09,2:53:02, @thami you have to allow that otherwise you end up blocking valid points. that's how frees peach works. @thami if you disagree with him that's the very reason you should allow him to speak. Free speech is everything guys.... Ignore this Rori Creature asomblief "We need an Agrizzi in construction contracts with departments you want to block me because you have no defense That's democracy.... Rori Rory. Honestly No Need for this Nonsense our constitution sadly doesn't give us the right to free speach. America is the only place on earth where you can say anything. and it's bacause they have learned from their past. 
2:53:13,2:54:27, Keep race out of this thing please guys... @Thando Nkutha Rory is a troll. The other day he was doing the same playing the role of a black person. Ignore they cannot help it Did you have Esidimeni under apartheid? No you did not. 120 black people were murdered by other blacks under a black govt and NO ONE was held accountable Rory has his own opinion...respect that..... they have the satanic instinct to be foul and vile when people are merely chatting Your black govt gave you klebsiela Nkandla ow Nkandla @thami it is so sad that the people taking the bribes from private sector have convinced you that the pro ate sector is at fault. government is responsible for keeping the private sector in line. 
2:54:28,2:57:20, in the blood Whats the update with the fact that the commission is held at the Tiso Blakcstar's head quarters and for the fact that Ramaphosa is their former chairman? Government of criminals. British and Americans must expose these criminals Rori is true we don't white to progress or not on our own we can destroy or build @Thami Mhlanga why does it matter who they're renting the building from? the very same people we have appointed to regulate the private sector now turn arround and tell us that the private sector or WMC is at fault. when they are the ones taking the bribes from. WMC WMC!!!!!!! private sector is the only reason south africa is still standing leave whites alone they are not the reason your black government is criminal "this is like blaming the person your spouse sleeps with. instead of blaming your spouse. WMC bribes government and we blame WMC 
2:57:20,2:58:29, I am not surprised to hear Zuma’s name "your black government outsourced prisons services to BOSASA "@Jack Sparrow..ethics my brother and conflict of interest. Professionally WMC!!!!!!!! @9Play9Boy9 So right ! Just imagine how wonderful our country would be if All the Commies left..........heaven on earth it would be... how many universities has your black government built in 25years. how many did the british build in the first 25years of their arrival in south africa? do the math fools when government themselves I vented the term WMC.. or at least payed a London company (white company) to invent WMC and keep us devided. I'm just not sure who's side he is working for 
2:58:39,3:01:00, clearly not just himself WMC!!!!!!! "Americans BIDVEST is equally corrupt. You wait and see. "@Jack Sparrow WMC = Wanted More Cash !!! Want  Uncle Donald's marines are coming guys.. "@ Thando Nkutha more evidence is coming sir this a first part "@Thami Mhlanga I don't see the conflict of interest "it is GOVERNMENTS perpouse/job to keep WMC /private sector in line. now they turn arround and say its the fault of the people they themselves are suppose to be regulating
