time,14:05,message where is the volume contradicting statements...this guy must be charged immediately.Purgery which contradicting statement are you on about Andrew ? Andrew is a BLF agnet where is Dali Mpofu he would have fun getting sharp answers from Nene "Nene- In April He‚Äôs being more honest that previous statements. I think he understands the outcomes will have harsh implications on him. "look we had the freedom struggle 
14:57,20:22, he does devious things for fun. @King Vuka....so basically Mr Nene lies depending what outcome suits him? They ask him question then he respond by reading from his script..... Minister Nene saved this country period "@Alex Mbontsi basically ewe I still think he is being selective to ensure that he is not implicated "@Alex Mbontsi that might be the case yes Yes he repented that I believe but he must not come play us to imply that he was not part of the group why is he selecting information he thinks is important to us. 
20:38,28:08, "Well there are more people to come and testify Remember Duduzane also agreed to appear and testify. This is gonna get hotter. I‚Äôm still to understand what he considered the Guptas as before they were a ‚Äúhot potato‚Äù and my assumption is he would say we were friends but saying that now would put him in a bad light "If you want to save your skin do like they did during the eskom inquiry As I see it...Mr Nene was part of the clique until the Guptas took it too far and he knew that he was in too deep and he started being uncooperative Whose next after Nene? because i dont see where we are going with Nene..honestly Let‚Äôs be honest...The South African government is rotten so as the private sector State Capture goes beyond the time of Zuma When GUPTAS was chowing money with Zuma like nobodies business. Petrol was cheaper... BRING BACK GUPTAS 
28:27,31:35, Petrol iyadura bakithi Aijaman üòÇüòÇüòÇüòç Yes @Wonga Masiza oh my... that young lady that is seating near Mr Pretorius. Can someone get me her number please. lol @Wonga Masiza ...I fully agree but after this we have to go back before Zuma because the issue with SA is structural Who knows the girl sitting next to counsel? the course of expensive petrol and tax is because of Zuma and his friends @abraham she's hot @Wonga Masiza even if I promise the position in cabinet you won't give me her name and number? 
32:17,34:19, @Skhumbuzo Nkosi yes broer don't wanna lie. she is too hot Peit you lie This NUCLEAR program has the potential to power half of Africa... and this fool has delayed it... coal is running out in mpumalanga and we have huge deposits of uranium üò≥ Bring back GUPTAS and Zuma..Petrol was cheap under them..... "She's what you call :BEAUTY and BRAINS""" @Aijaman Pirlo Are you stupid or just trying hard to sound stupid? "We owe Nene a great deal for not signing the Nuclear deal Yes @Slindile Ngcobo it's so true "@Mpho Mashigo And who would have paid your social grant? the country would have been broke 
34:45,37:10, Everthing is expensive these days yet we are still blaming other people. When you corrupt squandering money. You immidiately suffer because the money is not properly channelled. Whe we only suffer now if we go back preZuma era till when its the cut time of investigation? @Aijaman Pirlo The fact that you don't recognize continuity in policy and governance disqualifies you from commenting on ish you are clearly ignorant about They say petrol is expensive because of Zuma. Why it was not expensive that time because Zuma was corrupt with his friends including Nene. Why we only suffer now? Why now not at that time when Guptas were taking everything We definitely need to thank Nene. Otherwise we would have been downgraded even further. And the next generation would have to pay as well "@Aijaman Pirlo Ask your Zuma why PetroSA sold our strategic fuel reserves Rand lost value more than it was during the corruption of Guptas and Zuma. Why it never lost value that time? @Wonga Masiza are you serious bro? 
37:36,39:38, BRICS was going to fund it... that's why Zuma joined BRICS... The IMF is RAPING AFRICA Auti irrespective of Zuma selling PetroSA strategic what what. Fact is Petrol was cheaper as compared to now. Why it was not expensive at that time? "That's my wife you guys talking about @Thokozani Malgas oh you wish broer "@Aijaman Pirlo FACT is you are ignorant about fuel prices "I warn South Africans There's no fiends but intetests if you think China is our saviour unless you don't understand international relations or outright gullible sabc 404 needs audio please. "@Aijiman Pirlo the intellectual incapacity of your statements shock 
40:06,41:54, nywe nywe fuel prices where lower under Zuma but you forget that they were even lower under Mohlanthe and Mbeki i wonder if we still have people who are ground standing the corruption of zuma's administration.. No @Wonga Masiza my wife would kill me if she sees this. I am just joking Petrol is expensive because the USA has sanctioned IRAN and BRITISH PETROLEUM (BP) GETS ITS OIL FROM Iranüò≥ "Auti Mjita - I've been driving since I was 23 now I am 39. I can easily tell the difference on petrol price. Under Zuma @Aijaman PirloIt is sad to see an old man without an ounce of brains but let me clarify "surely before Zuma the bread was cheaper This inquiry is just a smokescreen to play dirty politics. We won't benefit anything out of this nonsense Mark my words 
41:55,43:29, SAA is in trouble because they stole it's planes ... tell people the Truth Neneüò°üò°üò° "1. No president sets fuel prices Some need to understand economics its so sad to witness such ignorance Fully agree with you @Aijaman Pirlo "2. Check where the ZAR was irt the dollar during Zuma years This Inquiry is just like TRC.. litre of petrol in 1994 was three rand True Desmond THE DOLLAR IS A SCAM. NOT GOLD BACKED NIX 
43:29,46:18, "3. what made things worse now is that the orange man in the states has decided to cut off IRAN Thank you @Aijaman Pirlo @Aijaman Pirlo actually you are not lying but exposing your stupidity and ignorance. There are many circumstances that play into the issue of petrol as like international oil prices and the rand Auti Mjita might think he is smart thinking that we will benefit something out of this nonsense. Mark my words. 2019 will come and go and nothing will have been done by that time audio on Sabc 404 is still not coming through and data is still expensive. production team please help @Aijaman Pirlo Are we still talking about your hero zuma or have you moved on to 2019? Black people do not fly all the time. We use buses when we cross country. I do not care about SAA. I did not fly for 15 years yet black people are made to be so concerned about SAA and forget the major issues "@Aijaman Pirlo Black people do fly 
46:30,50:03, "@Aijaman Not even a single Airbus which fall off the sky yet we so focused on it. Lets talk about Jobela buses and City to City buses and their standards because people die all the time on the road @Pirlo even if we dont use SAA we the taxpayers paid for it. "@Aijaman Pirlo It seems you have a lot of issues to raise We are black lets be concerned about issues which hit the poorest. Some-1 in Alexandra doesn't even know where is OR Tambo in JHB but that person is made to worry about SAA not City City @Aijama if there is a link between the state capture and buses we‚Äôll hear about it. You are too woke! "@King Vuka He is a sleepyist bra "Lets all come back here after this hearing and debate. Believe me uZuma uyityile imali uyityile. Akangowokuqala!!!! 
50:06,53:16, "@Aijaman Pirlo Tell that to your Zuma who was in power for over 9 years He did nothing just like the presidents before him. Just like Ramaphosa is doing now "@Aijaman Pirlo FYI @Pirlo. in simple terms buy now pay later Something doesn't add up with reasoning capacity of Zuma supporters "@Bongile Sibali We are trying to educate those that receive free Zupta data so they can go around sanging Zuma praises The widows of Marikana mine workers are yet to be paid anything till today. Now you say BFF is holding the payment yhoooo "@Aijaman Pirlo Your BFF did not act of the report 
55:01,56:36, So BFF got powers of holding governments payments? hehehehehehe hay yhoooo "I am repeating came here from enca stream which is broken "@Aijaman Pirlo Not payments bra I came to sabc streaming to ask for the lady sitting next to the advocates 10 digits at enca they dont have "Plus his government promised the Marikana widows cash I remember when Andries Tatane passed on. There was a commision. What happened after that commision? Nothing 
56:43,58:35, "This is when education matters We are all here from eNCA @Xhanti Silvester i Came before youüòÇüòÇ "@Aijaman Pirlo You are asking all the correct questions but to the wrong people I too am here now @nobhatyi injalo sbari "And that Chick @mluleki mnguni dont interfere with my hustling please "anyway 
58:48,1:00:40, how much will Mr Zondo be paid for this Inquiry. Auti Mjita - you think you smart as a result you don't look at reality. Mbeki squandered the FIFA money under the disguise of African diaspora. Mandela and his group of stellenbosch was corrupt ijooy zupta please help!! "@Aijaman Pirlo I don't think im smart bra @Lungisani Ntshonga Zuma is dividing the party working with Ace and mahumapilo am worried Once beaten twice shy. Sua forces must be fought in all platforms of our open society and exposed for how destructive they're Every president we once had was corrupt. De Klerk funded the killings in Boipatong and PolaPark..No commision ever established to look at these previous presidents "@Aijaman Pirlo now we are on Mbeki and 2010 
1:00:53,1:01:59, but Zuma was corrupt just like them. There is commision. Why because 2019 is around the corner and this commision is just a smokescreen @Aijaman...Can we just catch the fish we can for now how much will Mr Zondo be paid for this Inquiry. "Zwelethu - I promise you mfethu Bringing the past shows a poverty of discussion. Engage on the current narrative being presented than diversionary tactic He is earning his normal salary. This is not extra for him. Zinglish "@Aijaman Pirlo AGAIN New word 
1:02:01,1:03:39, He is a Justice.....He set for life. Google how they are paid and what happens when they retire... Zuma uses white as they are capturing treasure where he wants to push them away and capture state by himself @Aijaman Pirlo THE ONLY ONE CONFUSED HERE IS YOU BROTHER Zulu and English Anyway Mbeki and De Klerk are not on trial in the court of public opinion Thank you @Sindiswa Moolman DUDU MYENI ZUMA has he blocked me yet? hahahahahahahaha Im sure some politicians are crossing fingers that their names aren't dropped
