time,17:13,message Why was all our police ministers corrupt? The guy is so full of himself where is the musk sir FredBKevin to become a minister you need to be corrupt. when you try to answer too cautiously you make room for suspicion So true Arthur Kwenzakalani lana? A General is a Clerk??? 
18:34,29:14, he's getting irritated I want some Oros Shem Nhleko .He is cracking "Lieutenant General used to be called commandant in old SADF serious clerk then.... lets here this one It's so freaking annoying and disrespectful for Nhleko to respond nonsensically bullish to Hulley SC just to respond nicely to the Commissioner DCJ Zondo. This guy is a liar 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ n think he is smart this man needs to see a doctor! Has accountability issues """All governed by principles of accountability"" Eh?" 
29:15,34:24, "body language tells such a awesome story......I was not actually listening I wonder WHICH principles of accountability he and his political party are governed by? ...has he done a breath test yet? Think he is on planet 'papsak'! here it comes this guy are up to mischief An analysis is a view Ha ha ha what a Mampara....talking gibberish! "Nhleko is lecturing DCJ Zondo about law Usile 
34:46,38:13, it only works his way prima facie @jwarha21 u are delusional Acting clever to the wrong person. How do you lecture DCJ Zondo on what a report is? arrogance won't affect Adv Hulley What is this minister's Educational background?? he certainly could not have passed English logic! I must Say Adv Hulley is doing exceptionally well here... "'An Investigative Report is not based on views Can't believe that Nhleko as former minister of police doesn't understand the fundamentals of what a view/allegation/view/anaylysis is! 
38:23,41:11, zumas buddy He coughs like zuma. I don't trust him we want facts Every case in court is a contest between two different VIEWs. this guys and his examples Best this guy just shurrrrup...he is digging his hole and may pop up in China. oh his a traffic director now lol @Mandy the guy is stubborn and wasting commission times. "First truth he said ""i am not an expert in this""" 
41:12,46:46, "I'm gonna start a tv channel @Godfrey Mama True This is hilarious. his too opinionated Slam dunk! Eish mara ANC. Look and listen to leaders that are given Ministerial position. No idea at all. Its really a shame. Cry my beloved country Democracy for the ANC was all about stealing ...sad but true!!! Why is Zondo answering for him? Zondo used to play dices with Zuma during their youth days. 
47:06,50:42, "DCJ seem to be answering for Nhleko especially when the evidence leader probe him Yes they got him now 😂😂🤪🤪 @hunter lol "@R hunter I lost them the evidence leader going to loose his patience playing for time. bla boa bla so far he hasn't Batohi must take this fool to court 🙄 He is hanging himself😂😂😂 
50:48,52:57, This bustaad must leave the commission now what a wasted day No wonder ANC meeting go on for hours and they don't agree to anything fruitful. They talk about irrelevant things. wasted three days. what is right then? Wasting Tax Payers Money We Will Stop Paying Taxes immediately the most boring testimony ha ha what an idiot! Welcome to Planet Nlecko "@The Hidden Realms we don't pay tax This was a MINISTER 😂😂😂😂 
53:03,55:49, Liars Thieves murderers arrest them all and Seize the Assets what was the occurance Correct they take the tax for sure after we've paid it this guy doesn't need a lawyer The ANC must be so embarrassed with this guy...but do they actually care ? Time waster yessssss he want him to repeat the question to allow him to think of an answer. This guy acts dumb 
56:03,57:31, Can't believe that so much time is being wasted to protect wrong doing. Why would someone who was not involved in investigation have interest in changing a report there you go😂😂 Evidence leader is the one wasting time playing two parts. dumb and dumber He is Exposed he victimized McBride..leave the rest! Why is Zondo helping this guy?? 🚽 samuel i also wonders and then Zondo keng ka yena? 
57:38,59:06, Precisely Sam "They are so polite wooow Anc & ZanuPF will always look like two twin Bros #Arrogant think think my understanding Zondo is avoiding this guys long answers. Zondo definitely seems to be blocking Hulley at critical moments in his questioning. McBride was employed three or more years after the crime had been committed. He surely had nothing to do with the investigation. He should have stayed away and allow legal processes to unroll Harley came with an agenda Remember Nkandla report was challenged by Adv Madonsela and dismiss by Concourt 
59:16,1:00:30, MR Zondo go give the poor guy a hug😚 he said nothing😂😂 Former Minister Nhleko is on top of this and this shall end badly for the new Director of Foreign Intelligence. the authority he has because he is a minister @Godfrey Mama Eh? Why is the judge putting words in the mouth of the witness? He should let the witness answer the question and allow him to contradict himself if he is not telling the truth. this is the minister who brought us the fire poooool remember is Harley really a lawyer EVERYONE is WRONG 
1:00:44,1:02:08, Denial is not a river in Africa... Lying through his teeth! he got him there you are you missed nothing @thomas Bypass Mcbride ...he is😂🤣 caught out! bla bla bla... Minister has the oversight responsibility of the Portfolio he manages. May speak to anyone anytime within that Portfolio. Why is time being wasted How many more of Ministers of Police are going to be guilty of misconduct. It's shameful. 
1:02:36,1:04:20, Oh yes even when you are guilty you are not guilty.... what a low life uncleRay should insist in respect 😅🤣🤣🤣 Wipe your tears revolutionary parties a joke esp in SADC How on earth are we having such clueless barbarians as leaders Why do you by pass McBride sir? It's not Hulley who has been wasting time. Harley is wasting time on non-important issues. @Leon Lebangwa I agree let's agree that we disagree 
1:04:30,1:06:03, this arrogant guy wasted time. Dcj also waffles too much "uncle Ray Adv is also beating about the bush... Hahahaha.....Hulley just showed them a finger now for talking to much. Three ringed circus "TEKKEN - ""FINISH HIM""" this commission is just a huge farce... wonders what Lea and Kate would have reached with this witness 
1:06:17,1:07:18, is this cross eximanition? haibo this lawyer Give us a break Zondo. Please don't interrupt again within the next 10 minutes. am losing faith in Chief Zondo at a rapid rate! nhleko going to waffle to get out of answering as per norm....sad This witness is useless. You can't get anything from him. They must bring Bheki Cele instead😂😂😂😂 The witness knows his staff. Sorry if you don't like him. he isn't going to make it... this guy going to waste time on purpose Leon Mbangwa you're right 
1:07:48,1:09:10, I miss Hlaudi😁😁😁 "we beggex uncle to stop interrupting i bet u he wouldnt have had this attitude to Ms Hofmeyer what a stupid question never!!! he would be out on his ear Feel sorry for the people who cannot see through the lies!!! Hulley uyozela ngok i stillll have silence 
1:09:23,1:12:15, that tiny voice becomes a sting with substance @quest....guess you'd have done a better job:-) see you all 2morrow sometime i cant agree with u more The former minister is Guilty based on how he answers the question Hulley is feeling @Mandy Phillips I'm too busy love lol ewe ebezokwenza umsebenzi omhle. bajonge bazayobuza ndithini oonontombi Giv him 2 adv.Maleka den yul c🤔 
1:13:26,1:15:31, Lecturing an Adv neh this ? the likes of adv maleka have quit this farce. . they didn't back you either did they? "He run away now Answer the question. it's record. Hulley lies Lol... So does this mean McBride used a technicality to evade accountability? "it's record that Hulley said 
1:15:32,1:21:03, hulley uyabheda "Nhleko is like some cricketer standing at his crease and just defending and stoping each ball ...in a very long dull test match This is taking time by dwelling with simple answer shame Hulley..... smh Minister of ducking and diving par excellence I just don't know how Hulley was appointed here. This evidence leaders is hopelessly weak. Yhuuuu Ya ex minister blame every one @Thembelani Ndlazi indeed and he is constatly trying to prove him wrong and almost not informed on processes 
1:21:27,1:23:47, if you take all the time - no one can get an answer - now your are usurping the power of the concourt There is an old man with a bald head who is just working to sanitize the mic lol ayi "shem "Its not all Hulley Agreed Thembelani Publicly shows his incompetency "Now all of a sudden he can answer with a simple ""yes""" now the paid mouth piece will try to whitewash this man and take as long as he chooses - while he wanted this ended to meet his other commitments? @Dominic Przybylski Yes also noticed that 
1:24:36,1:28:01, hi Me too re simple answers.. @Thomas Cleghorn 😁😁😁😁😁 Hulley is being castrated Who is the questioner and who does he represent? ofedile matla Hulley so short and sweet when the questions try to prove tat you are right. When it suits you you quote extensively from the law and the validity of the rulings? Paul Pretorious must bif up his team asap 😟 "Advocate Mkhari 
1:28:41,1:36:28, Thanks Luvuyo lets waste more time and avoid anything of consequence? Please send him home without wasting more time the real state capturers are being exposed. Karma catches all. Al Bashir now jailed in his own country. "Talking about situations and consequences that arose from the trumped up charges. Disjuncture "@Redeemar you are lying advocate mkhari black excellence A real Devils Advocate... Y is Zondo not interjecting 
1:37:13,1:40:37, mkhari is exposing Hulley's agenda why should Zondo interject Seems that suddenly we are not in any hurry. Parliament must now act against a sitting minister - in what circus will this happen - not in cloud cuckoo land there we again about goats Mkhari poking holes on Hulley Judges don't easily intervene in re-examination. first time I saw Ali got no power "@Luvuyo Zantsi  Is all this todo about those excisions from the 2 reports? All charges and might of the law directed to that? 
1:40:48,1:43:23, this guy will go Scot free or differences.... but it's not Nhleko's fault that the IPID Act was unconstitutional Molo @funicanz unjani? May Zondo be granted the WISDOM to make the right decision after this finishes. "@Luvuyo Zantsi  no just picking up on the letter of the law while he was protecting his appointer - the right honorable and honest President Zuma Mr Zondo needs Wisdom and guidance from the lord🙌 he acted within the law and it was later found the law is unlawful hence parliament to amend the legislation accordingly 
1:43:54,1:48:04, you shouldn't feel embarrassed when the court says you've acted unlawfully!!! you should not because you have acted according to the law but the law was drafted wrongly and unconstitutional and that's not you fault No wonder he can't find a job - taking responsibility is not in his DNA - he just wants authority to spend other peoples money while he alludes to all sorts of imaginary enemies We need these politicians to be put in their place but too many south africans are brainwashed to support corrupted politicians the the role of the superior court to guide people into the correct interpretation Apartheid was morally wrong and legal domestically bcos of legislation hence many never saw the inside of jail. it was the democratic government that dealt with apartheid perpetrators @Redeemed ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ - boring repetition ZZZZZZZZ There are criminals in parliament and you anc supporters are responsible for that zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzag shame 
1:48:21,1:51:28, Nhleko wil go with his tail up..am not hepi with carnt comishin legal team..sori😕 HYPOCRISY!!!! "I presume all watching this and hearing his answers know in their hearts that Nhleko is lying We should be running a trial and putting these idiot in jail - the truth should then set them free - when they find out what the 'truth' means who mishandled the whole issue if it wasn't you? The entire anc needs to be dismantled. Anc is nothing but a scam to make people remember 1994 and Mandela and the end of apartheid. ANyone here think Nhleko is being scapegoated and is inocent of all (or most) wrongdoing :goodvibes: Biggest mistake was giving africans full charge of government when they clearly were not ready. They needed more time to learn how to manage a country and develop morales 
1:52:09,1:54:46, Yes same fire pool clown it was Nxesi @TheTruthShall SetYouFree sounds a bit patronizing...mistakes were made all round... Nhleko reported on the firepool report "zondo is favouring the anc and its cronies Agree @Nic van As You brainwashed people can't see that ANC is so corrupted. Even after the stories of anc corruption were made public people still bloody vote for them. anyone with proof of state capture? .... I mean the real state capture? 1 
1:54:52,1:57:10, Thomas Cleghorn = just like Arbeid Macht Frei but some people admit their mistakes - have you seen any remorse here "Yourll think Mandela was a saint. He was a bloody poster boy. And yes No one has a right to tell us how to vote. Just read the body language "The fact is that African people vote for anc because they are and Africa party. That's what I have a problem with. They don't care about corruption an African party* Coma Hurley do u have any thing to say there is no better alternative they can trust even the commission formulation and activities are wrong in the eye of this weetness 
1:57:12,1:59:26, Advocate Mkhari But Anybody in their right mind would not vote for the Commie ANC/EFF..........unless they been brainwashed......ne There is more than one party that is African-led. The DA was African-led in the last elections. The rabbit hole hoes deep. Some can't handle the real situation we are in goes deep* The EFF is African-led the problem with evidence leaders is that they're trying to proof preconceived notions "Some people don't even realise there's a war on your mind 
1:59:55,2:02:03, All parties are African lead because all of us are Africans.... And our government are master of obfuscation =- and they will keep the majority voters in poverty and slavery all for the cost of a food parcel and a T shirt So it does not make sense to say that black people vote for the ANC only because it is African-led. He refuses to answer this report question. No credible court of law could find mr nhleko guilty based on what the evidence leaders led hear. Complete waste of time and resources. "The london crooks are the Rothschild family. They own the reserves banks all over the world. Only Iran Well said @dennis oldude Yeh our real enemies are spiritual beings If you don't believe we have spiritual enemies then you are in for a shock when it does get revealed 
2:02:42,2:05:05, Now please let Kate handle of the miscreants "Hulley So the CEO has finished Well times are changing. I hope you all see through the lies and corruption "Great We are all one big cosmic family. Notshe is Back what a headache him and the Chair together You can only claim to be an African if you were born in Africa....Those loyal to their countries of origin are not Africans... Mo AFRIKA. Why do you say Adv Hulley is a poor lawyer? 
2:05:20,2:10:23, @Hubert Maphumulo .......Reckon you are so wrong my friend.........we just don't want to see OUR wonderful country going to the dogs bye the Commies I thought Hulley was superb...he was just interrupted all the time. @MIKE DURBAN ...but Mike the more I see how capitalism is failing the world over the more I am wondering about socialist scenarios...It doesw work in very limited examples 😉 Ooooo..no.Notshe..realy..aikona..aaiman yerrrrrr🙈🙈 "Oh my goodness. Please if you don't know the truth then dont make assumptions. The savior Who cares what colour OUR Lord is......he's the Master etc etc @Kevin ........I reckon that Capitalism is just the Lessor of all the systems............ Probably ....@MIKE DURBAN "Obviously Jesus would have been like what the people in his place of birth would of been like. He wouldn't have been caucasian 
2:10:26,2:15:09, @ Redeemed Sinner 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂 my thoughts as well but all pretends to let the clowns get away "i am a african  @TheTruthShall SetYouFree ...Reckon Jesus must have been half Jew....surely Mary was a Jewess... @Andre van Schalkwyk ..... no truer words spoken today....thats why my heart aches. "What language did Jesus speak? Ancient hebrew. Jesus wasn't a Jew Living in accordance to The Lord's will. Andre van Schalkwyk while I agree with you 100% I do have a problem with criminals such as our governent and this witness who is obviously trying to deceive all!! "Identifying to a particular religion causes division. Christianity Some to the nicest people I've met are criminals. 
2:15:34,2:18:58, whilst I'm stuck in rsa doesn't mean trump can't perform GOD'S CRUDE OIL GLOBAL BLACKOUT EUTHANASIA ANTI-APOCALYPSE BY LAW Who needs somebody else to be their Lord. Christ was misinterpreted when he said the Lord and I are one. He meant we each be our own lord. Focus on repentance and pray to the Lord. When you receive the holy spirit then you will know how to live. It will be revealed within you. @Dominic Przybylski ......so true. I am the nicest person you will ever know but I am a criminal. All because I smoke and love my beer 😂 @Kevin Lol. "The Lord is holy Keven so am I and 8million others or the lord is a sinner. same thing I guess. My underpants are holy.
