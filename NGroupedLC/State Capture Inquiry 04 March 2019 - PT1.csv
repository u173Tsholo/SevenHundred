55:48,1:12:27, There u go ............. video shedding again "SABC  SABC is captured üòÇüòÇ RFP??? request for proposal there are processes for rfi and rfp the money is gone what is RFI and RFP 
1:13:22,1:16:05, Rfp is request for proposal RFP Request For Proposal @Cassius I explained it already rfi is request for information I was not tuned in rfi is request for information Thanks for the clarificationüôè Why is the SABC not broadcsting these commissions live on tv and radio? The public deserves full and free access to these shocking revelations. docs used by gov to invite companies to come bid for tenders or render services to gov 
1:17:12,1:22:41, Sho Thando. someone can correct me if I'm wrong. mokgoro is a little bundles of state capture These cover all the Aspects of state Both rfi and rfp are structured processes in contracts Volume please Yes South Africa is going to change bit by bit even though the will be people who will be corrupt and this eskom thing is killing our economy unbundling it will reduce the volume of capturing. ?? Just tuned in after being loadshed. Thanks to Eskom Time we start calling loadshedding what it really is: black outs. something smells of BS 
1:22:51,1:44:24, Time we call state capture what it is: ANC looting of our state. So this should really be a commission on inquiry into how the ANC looted our state. I for one think loadshedding is apartheid product because the capacity of eskom was just designed for the few and now the masses also want energy and therefore the capacity is insufficeint.. @Felix Muyoba The management of Eskom warned the government still in the time of Mbeki that they should start to build more power stations. They didn't listen. Mbeki later said government was wrong. "@Felix Muyoba Nope. Eskom generates less electricity now than they did then @JS Bach you're right. it's ANC's fault @JS Bach and @Joel Mzayidume you guys are wrong!! "Have you read that article @Felix Muyoba what is stated by @JS Bach is recorded fact. 
1:44:51,1:48:31, but don't let facts get in the way of your predjudice @Jack Sparrow those guys who ran it (eskom) then were short sighted..they were not following the strat plan..all they were interested in are bonuses.. @Joel Mzayidume no man..factual incorrect.. @Felix Muyoba In 1998 Eskom predicted that demand would outstrip supply in 2008. The ANC was too busy feeding at the trough to take notice. And then in 2008 we ran out of juice But it was the guys at Eskom who told Mbeki to to build more power stations?? It was the ANC government that didn't want to! I don't understand your bonuses story. m @Felix Muyoba no problem stick with what you believe in. Mabuza is happy that there are people like Felix that fall for their stories. @JS Bach But you can't deny that Donald Trump was caused by apartheid 
1:48:42,1:51:15, @Jack Sparrow understood but what happened to the profits eskom accummulated before then? why didnt they use that to expand eskom capacity instead of asking gvt? "@Jack Sparrow I'm agreeing with you - my comment starting with ""But it was the guys"" was aimed at Felix. Can't stand DT remember gvt has other more pressing social responsibilities to attend to @Felix Muyoba how much profit was that? Remember Eskom was funding the electrification of black people's homes. New build required serious money from Treasury @Felix Muyoba any build programme would be subject to approval by the government. Eskom couldn't go it alone "#Jack Sparrow  SA government is finished under ANC "Electricity is rather pressing Vote VF+ 
1:51:30,1:53:09, "@Frik Brits we're blaming apartheid for everything Apartheid was the best thing that happened Deputy president dd Mabuza once said loadshadding is a sign of growth of eskom @Tommy Anderson to donald trump @Tommy Anderson don't start with this nonsense. #Jack Sparrow OOhhh i see now hehehe The americans would like this joke "What nonesense @Joel Mzayidume you see people like @Tommy Anderson.. @Eslon Eslon ...and Mabuza is just one heartbeat away from president

2:00:31,2:02:29, "#Gwanya Mandla  Zondo keep repeating this instruction but his team is always not organized Who is the reason that we have business of the day like this? "@Tommy Anderson the problem with you is that you have lost your privileges and therefore angry at that..forget about that era Don't tell me what to think little boy I have all the rights in the world üòÇüòÇüòÇ "Frik everybody has rights..the problem is that not everyone has privileges @Tommy Anderson

CleverüòÉ Eskom NEVER had load shedding under white government FACT siviwe slara Are you thick upstairs? But Eskom served what percentage the population that time? Like Malema? Zuma brought so many problems both to the ANC and the state. I blame Malema and the youth league of his time who brought him to power Eskom served the ones that did not steal electricity 
2:10:27,2:14:08, "fact dont forget about illegal connections "Julius Malema is the biggest problem causer of our age "The fall of the ANC @Tommy dont forget that your people stole money too but it was swept under the carpet "If the blacks are so powerful "The ANC stole so much money that the government is crippled "@Tommy Anderson ALL of them are criminals

Apartheid was a front you used to get the international community's attention "@Tommy "The last 25 years was a lie and look for yourself what is happening. In order for something to be able to be broken down who killed Chris Hani it is a white man who pulled the trigger
