48:08,51:28, Cargo Karos 90 of living things on Earth are are between 30 degrees north and south of the equator. Europe is completely outside of that zone. it's always about land & MINERAL RESOURCES. right prescott. in jamica the chimese are giving our people $1.96 slave Labour Dankie Siya... people should be arrested . both the chair and the adv are not coping well with Agrizzi pace of testimonies thus wating lot of time by repeating what he has already explained. "Im glad Agrizzi is not in KZN because wow I'm tired of people who always remind us about apartheid we are now new rainbow nation there must all go couse there are doing this because there are saying there fought for this freedom If Mandela was here he would go back to his 5 star sel then live amongst you all He knows nothing will happen to him this SA...

The only mistake the citizens of SA made was to allow the cats to take care of the mice. VOTE CORRECTLY COMRADES bye @eugene "@ Thando im sure there is a stash of cash somewhere to cover that  
54:48,56:33, what is his problem anyway Apartheid was better then it was now. people was getting large amounts of food for free. but our anc government doesn't feed us Dave east I have studied resources globally for over 28 years to understand why we were enslaved & continue to be exploited. it's all because of The Land & MINERAL RESOURCES.

1:00:56,1:01:54, Agrizzi was warned by van Tonder that Watson was going to blame eveything on him some serious stuff it's was always about Gupta brothers now you see this goes deeper No more defending crooks Love the way he sings! 😂 yeah @thando Why is Zondo wearing those glasses coz he keeps on taking them off Dave east I see what is happening in the DR. none of European countries & The US want to lose control of the mineral in The DR and all through Africa. A special S/O to you guys for streaming the inquiry under SABC youtube channel. Let's continue to push our SOE forward instead of eNCA. sad story

They think we are stupid..Ppl who stole millions for a livings would have seen this coming..this is all planned they just giving us a slice of a cake... Hhayi ke!!! "I suggest that we look at the whole yes. prescott I mean dual ruling Something fair to all of us Watson maybe is Zuma’s hidden friend @Elloise Jofriet It is because we look at each other as different races rather than individuals. Governments fail no matter skin color 
1:05:24,1:07:05, which accounting firm was auditing BOSASA There can never be dual ruling cause they hate the color of our skin and that will never change yeah remove all the corrupt and put fresh blood where is white or blacks who would move the country in the direction of Jesus Christ Intriguing how they would wash money Bosasa! What a racket! This is unparalleled racketeering! Who audited this people. they are also included @Allan obviously there were getting paid off The ANC is not wrong because there black. it is the Europeans fault it's always the white man's fault 
1:07:12,1:08:34, @siyabonga dlamini Agreed. People in power tend to be corrupt. We need to start talking to each other about the problems in this country and leave race at the door "Can I just say death request they audit themselves i guess hw is anc involved up to sooo far? adricans and its diaspora need to be engaging and deal with our issues "Now I understand why umsholozi didn’t want this state capture they are groups blaming white people for everything has become our favourite sport @Ngubane watch n listen u will hear names.. not the ANC but the members who are corrupt

Dr Khotso de Wee news24 check it out Elloise your the only one that cares. 
1:15:51,1:17:22, Can I just say that there is a huge difference between racism and being inhumane Your just a scared little white girl I for one follow the teaching of Jesus Christ it's make me to be in peace with everyone "Corruption knows no race @siyabonga dlamini But I do believe I can make a difference by trying to change the attitude towards different races by being reasonable siyabonga dlamini........AMEN "@Eugene I may be scared There's a new misguided wave of black consciousness led that sees every matter in black & white while excusing wrongdoing by our own brothers BREAKING: Zondo commission secretary implicated in Bosasa corruption 
1:17:31,1:19:13, I guess you can try @houws hey we need to break this hatred between blacks and white @Tebogo V The same happens in the white community. Also not just black people There is no thing like black consciousness who is the secretary "@Eugene tebogo its not about excusing our corruption. this is our house not their too loot or feel like they can do anything. whites are visitors not family You are arrogant and safe behind your little screen no one died I was born supreme "News24 can report that Agrizzi will name De Wee as a recipient of cash payments relating to a 2008 tender awarded to Bosasa subsidiary 
1:19:43,1:22:04, @siyabonga dlamini Dr Khotso de Wee it's people like eugene who are not needed in the community because there divide the country "Siyabonga Yoooo ku rough langaphandle All of us have smallernyana skeletons-Bathabile Dlamini😃😃😃 there is no such thing as Black and White people! These are racist terms. No one with an ounce of intelligence would identify themselves with these terms. What a disappointing human condition. is he or she here on the inquiry @houws Where is Patricia D? Guys give sis Pat a chance vote for her party This is in return for a 2008 contract awarded to Sondolo IT which was worth roughly R600-million for the provision of CCTV and access control systems at DOJ buildings around the country and courts. 
1:22:27,1:24:33, "@swanepoel true @Bruce we are all African since we are in South africa "Bruce Thack: we dont want the racism "@Bruce Thackwell you are so honest and correct myani youre a slave for your master keep quite 👱‍♂️👧🏿 This practice was also applied when Sondolo IT/GTS was awarded a R400-million contract in 2011 to provide physical guarding at the same court buildings and National Prosecuting Authority offices. @Bruce Thackwell True. Education is key I was not born a racist I was created a racist thanks to the government and the eff 🖕🏻smell my whire finger "Education mmmmm 
1:24:51,1:26:54, Whose education Yes Siyabonga YES! the terms Black and White are peddled by those who want to divide. Can you imagine what a great people we would be without these ridiculous terminology. @Bruce Thackwell We would solve so many problems Dr Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe said africa for afrians without any race meaning we r all human beings so muat dis name calling it wont take us anywhere cause us as blacks we each other name zulu changane "Dr Khotso de Wee "I cant accept that people like you can judge us bruce we are not the same thats why we are in a competative world. eu asia Russia africa....we are in competition . Don't think you are unique to racism. Thats another cop out. All people in Africa Suffer from poverty in fact South Africans are better off than most Africans. You should find the real reasons. 
1:26:58,1:29:16, @Mzalwane Mzala But he is part of the commission who is inquiring about exactly what he is part of @Mzalwane Mzala Its like appointing a cop to solve a murder case he himself commited Bruce: where do you hail from? we r all human beings dis race thing won't take us anywhere n blaming all the white people for what happened in d past wont aslo because this healing start by helping each other to move the country forward THEFT THEFT THEFT bruce south africans are economically enslaved. no land..money nor do they control or hire their people. its today thst we are looking 4 a change @siyabonga dlamini yes helping . . . not hardening hearts against each other siyabonga dlamini...👍 
1:29:27,1:32:21, "Where I hail from is not important Elloise Mandela wanted a rainbow nation. Not a nation that discriminates on race expropriation without compensation IS THEFT Dave South Africans are the best off people in Africa so please identify the real causes liberate your mind "Bruce that is true @Bruce that's right discrimination on race won't helps in anyway 8% of people cannot possibly enslave. Its impossible african american worked for 300+ years free labour stolen houses land ..jobs and houses stolen and have not recieved reparations. its estimated 12 to 13 trillion 
1:32:23,1:34:15, I am only looking forward to the end result of the commission. Heads rolling one thing I've learned from our white brothers as blacks we can learn to eat healthy and working hard to achieving our dreams rather then waiting for the government This sounds like a Money Laundering Seminar to teach every company the know how............this will just create more problems for the country his black his a bit slow. they don't know if you buy something it belongs to you "Bruce "Thomas u right "shame ANC  "Still doing the White Black thing Siyabonga "Rate 
1:34:22,1:35:33, siyabonga in Europe the governments fund and invest in its people and were given free housing in the 1800s ..as well as land Just say ANC batho Thats ANC "Salaries of civil servants are increased by cents yet money is stolen by millions daily in the public coffers. Not yet Uhuru. MaAfrica Was there any mention of the GUPTAS anywhere in this process.... Britton was colonised more than 30 times get over it "Bruce man As a ANC member and voter I am so disappointed. My heart is broken........😢 Greed seems to always win 
1:35:37,1:37:11, @Bruce I don't know to a dress the race maybe teach me what must I call whites couse I don't know anything I would say cry our beloved country Africa "can bosasa come an install security fence for free like other  It looks like the Guptas is just a tip of an iceberg. The problem of corruption goes deeper that we thought Cry indeed Kagiso @Thomas Dube What is disappointing? I think there must be way more than Guptas and Bosasa "tenders  Noooooo Lindokuhle......... you are just making things worse for me. 
1:37:45,1:39:08, I THINK WE SHOULD DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT you guys are busy saying corruption this corruption that..nonsense..you all have a price. Every man has a price. ANC is a very old organisation. Trusting old things is a safety hazard. they may brake anytime did he just implicate Mr President by mentioning a certain donation for certain elections? When was Bosasa established? I DONT HAVE A PRICE "Was this excuses in writing lol but you do. "Mzalwane Mzala 
1:39:11,1:40:11, " Siyabonga there are no such things as whites greys and Blacks. Better people call people by name @ntokozo he was working over there for 20 year @Thomas Dube The ANC has many members and not all of them are angels. @Thomas Dube The sooner you realize that political parties are not there to serve the people the better you are off. They are ALL there to serve themselves Always question their motives because it is NEVER pure Bosasa is like a Colombian movie of cartels i dont want any money; i want land Throughout its history ANC has always been captured. In years past before 1994 it was captured by white liberals and the so-called white leftists. . 
1:40:25,1:41:46, you all have a price. difference between all of you and Agrizzi is he's amongst the few who had an opportunity. please stop acting like you're all these embodiments of righteousness "Hence Thando Nkutha​ RIP ANC 10 feet underground Individuals will beheld to account and the ANC grows stronger. @MyANC IS DONE.

You cannot claim to know and then not answer out of fear that you are going to be pointed out as a hypocrite IF THERE ANC MEMBERS HERE; U ARE STUPID We are voting ANC and it does not bother us that people who never supported the ANC pretend that they were once with us.

2:15:37,2:17:14, EFF must lead @Thando Nkutha You call others stupid but you cannot grasp even what I am trying to say. Don't give ANY ruling party a majority of 67%. How do you NOT get that? lol na VIVA - - IT MEANS THAT 60% OF THE POPULATION ARE STUPID Opposition parties are there to keep ANY ruling party in line - to be held accountable Being insulted by few haters does not affect the ANC. "Urugulument uYehova ... Ubukunkane is only hope for whole world... because POLITICIANS "OKSALAYO 
2:17:16,2:18:54, "Yes i will vote the DA "@Mzalwane Mzala no insult  I said in 1994 that come 2019+ the ANC will no win outright All polls point to an ANC victory if there all don't have a greed there should all join together and form one party to take over anc now there are all greedy ANC planned their own downfall "Zizoh no political party is deserving DA my party 
2:18:54,2:20:01, ANC comrades who are involved in the corruption would were coached by whites from the DA. EFF graduated from ANC. Zuma once said investigation of corruption should go beyond 25yrs. vote UDM @Mzalwane Mzala for now. Till everybody reads what is busy happening here vote UDM just wonder the dislikes who it is No i will vote DA "Behind EVERY SUCCESSFUL MAN...is an EXHAUSTED WOman.... WOMEN SHLD BE RULING...ALL VITALLY V.I.P. THINGS...eg. SCHOOLING/HOUSING/FOOD The EFF and ANC are the same party. There were insults against ANC members in 1999 and still the ANC won elections by 66.35%.

WHY SHUD I NURSE UR FEELINGS Terror Lekota is anti land expropriation though no political party is a saint aiy whooooa...... vote UDM vote UDM UDM is white Sponsered ran by roelf meyer

It yep vote UDM you are not voting for a race you are voting for better governance vote UDM @Mzalwane Mzala i'm not saying anything it's what the ANC and people they put in office are doing to them race plays an important part of how things are ran. whites have their communities and wealth using politics and finances 
2:25:12,2:27:04, "@Thando Nkutha Angelo is an agent employed eitheer by DA or EFF to destroy the ANC. geeee "BUYISWA ANC IS STUPID I have already joined the DA "Ladies and gentlemen THE PERSON WHO TAKES A BRIBE IS STUPID "This guy knows his job "the ANC don't want tainted people to stand during the election 
2:27:34,2:29:05, truth is whomever vote for ANC are brain washed people. or they benefit somehow from this monies Angelo's video showed only 3 people and we dont know which party they vote for when they vote. they could all be damaging the ANC to advance their fav Party (DA or EFF). We'll vote for EFF Viva ANC viva "Buyiswa what you are saying undermines your thinking capability Vote DA "the way this corruption is organized Yes DA yamasimba IM NOT VOTING DA OR EFF BUT I WILL SAY IT CLEARLY THAT ANC IS MOSQUITOES 
2:29:18,2:32:17, Yeah Every1 want Enrich themselfs THEY EXIST TO SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF U we need to build lots and lots of jails. cadre deployment and they still continue with this nonsense.. let's punish ANC @ the polls Vote DA.not the VBS boys @Yvonne Morudu lets build schools 1st. Anyone voting for ANC going forward should be held equally liable for the ongoing corruption in South Africa. (Continuously empowering those who continue with corruption) Most schools where burnt by the VBS looters no EFF is worse Julius bankrupt Limpopo remember politics is about choosing how money is distributed. and we have the power to choose where the money goes.... choose you not how you feel. choose your community 
2:32:25,2:34:13, The ONLY hope for our country now is to vote for the DA.. Forget their shortcomings but they will save this country from complete destruction...They will bring back law and honour to our country "ask not whom i came to troll  I will vote the EFF to please Thando Jonathan Palivili ill never vote for racists I will vote the VBS looters what are we going to do with ANC thieves they all need to be in jail or we can let them leave like sardines in jail who came here for the names @Thando Nkutha There are many more parties to choose from. Why limit only three with the most flaws? Mooks689... Are not the ANC and EFF racists ??? 
2:34:30,2:36:04, which of the three is concerned more for the people than their own pocketsthe truth is guys our boetas in the ANC would have not thought of these creative ways to loot the tax-payer's money. so if you vote DA yooooo corruption will be on a high. Jonathan Palivili DA racism is pure and clear hi all. This is not a race or a political thing. Its a crime thing that is affecting all of us Directly. Crime and corruption knows no race or political party. EFF the solution.. come election day FFS. My morale has never been this low. so vote UDM people Lionel struis i agree with you i cant believe myself that i once loved the anc.....😥 
2:36:27,2:41:03, @Thando Nkutha The opposition collectively will be a certain percentage no matter the winner. That is what is important - more important than who is on top EFF is for the poverty stricken and is for our 92% people who are poor ethics and morality are no longer in the game proctolicians are only there for money I am angry.. I wanted to give them a chance this ANC but after this I rather vote AWB or freedom front.. I am angry.. all what they want is to drive those revolting big cars a So the Guptas are not the only beneficiaries of corruption. Thanks ANC Like when there was a vote of no confidence against Zuma. He would have been long gone if the opposition was more than the ANC yvonne vote for your best interest EFF are VICIOUSLY fighting for us @Yvonne Morudu give them a chance sisi 1 last time. they are cleaning their act now you will see 
2:41:11,2:42:52, "@Mzalwane Mzala stomach politics or blind loyalty @Thando Nkutha We all are thinking also about our children mam "buyiswa @Tholithemba Ntsele EXACTLY! "@buyiswa if they are cleaning they act @cl4hisown they are man. i believe how come we still.have criminals loke monkoyane and bathabile there "you all have to understand the usage of their words swearing on the bible not to whistle blow haaibo Watson
