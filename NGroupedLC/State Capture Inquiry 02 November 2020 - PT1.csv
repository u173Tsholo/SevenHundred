It is him who has the power to do so @Sbu Nkosi ure new here my brother u don't know whats going on relax "No one is saying support thieves @Tembelani Mbanjwa. there are businesses protocols for blacks or whites neither the legal processes and procedures for black or white lawyers. They all learn and read from the same literature Siyanda ufuna ngibhale siSwati?

There seems to have been a personal relationship rather than a professional one. @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee lol😂😂 
1:16:14,1:18:03, Where are the regulars today tje people who actually know whats going on? Ms Hofmeyer is going to nailllllllll this witness @Khanyi. AgeGracefully ewe sisi.

AgeGracefully - I cannot agree to that EVERYTHING WITH BLACKS IS AN ISSUE/NO CHANCES OF SUCCESS BUT WE CAN MOVE ON!! her lies are making my ears itchy "so far @Zinhle Big Daddy Dee agreed chief😂 
1:18:03,1:19:20, Chair demonstrates basic human courtesies so well.

"When your lawyer becomes too defensive play nicely together everyone My Lady K! Lol where has the Balarooon been all this time u missed everything!!

I think it would've avoided the issue... Hey @Khanyi What did I miss this morning? Not 1 race can say they are free of corruption. You get bad apples in all races so lets not paint all people with the same corrupt brush "Because by saying ""black people"" it implies a number of things like it's exclusive only to blacks or that the skin colour plays a part in the corruption" LOL @Cruda Bex "@Naledi Barron gm again
