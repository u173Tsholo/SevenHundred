"Mr Zondo ... we need to see justice - arrests - AFU now - before the more than likely orchestrated State Of Emergency being declared 
50:28,52:14, Ace and Zuma are the same Ramaphosa jr and Zuma jr are the same ANC is corrupt to the deepest core of life Vote eff come May 19 "*WITHOUT PREJUDICE* He’ll more than likely instruct EksDom to hit that “OFF” button arrest zuma pls Zuma retweets that Malema has to talk about him to get ‘attention’ The NPA stopped the SIU from further investigation and we know who headed the BPA at that time Zuma and ace must rot in jail vote eff come May 19 and we will make sure he goes to prison in my lifetime ✊🏿eff 
52:15,54:09, *NPA "Even though he was the lead investigator he did not ultimately make the decision to stop eff=vbs looting news. ft died! 😂 "nobody is going to jail dt ! This anc is corrupt in all ways Every day more and more corruption 
54:20,55:47, "tax all 62 on mega war in @Johnny Cash ....but you voted ANC previously where is the food cola criminals Never ever in my lifetime did I vote anc pa said he wanted a free house. now he wants free land. talk or numbern 
55:48,57:33, May 19 is my first vote and it’s going to the eff✊🏿 viva my CIC! We will never compensate✊🏿 Anc will lose 20% of the voters to the eff all. brifgekid "minus 7 😂 @Entry X what is your problem you 
57:43,58:58, Yes my CIC is also corrupt but Nothing Like the anc! Therefore my vote is for eff✊🏿 "In understanding as to how corruption started one has to ask whether a tomato is a veg or fruit was 1 Its clear that you are trolling @Johnny Cash Why vote for anyone that is corrupt? lol #Derek Main 🎯👏🏻 lies Because all politician is corrupt! 
59:00,1:00:01, he But anc is the worse by far! ✊🏿eff people who are going to vote for ANC must think about the next generation. every corner of the organisation is corrupt. the ANC of integrity is gone and forgotten. beiga teiffe lol Walking barefoot does not necessarily mean you are awake but drinking water after eating can make one angry. Yesterday Real Madrid played but an apple a day does not keep the state away Agrizzi was spot on "@Johnny Cash In that case ask 
1:00:20,1:01:23, mega fkn mic @Yin Yang Definitely. "Not sure how an investigation becomes thorough and informative when ‘material witnesses’ were not interviewed and didn’t give versions to dumb @Derek Main Sounds like releasing a murderer because they only murdered a child not like the one who murdered an adult @Johnny Cash has a curious logic. "plus 7 @Norman Zwane Yes - strange indeed. Wake up South Africa and stop being fed lies. under the ANC the country is doomed. Which party can i VOTE? 
1:01:28,1:03:25, m hm @Thamsanqa...they did extensive FORENSIC investigation first @Magda Seguin did they? Wow....judge Zondo probing this SIU ‘investigation’ properly? C "working class Are you kistening to the sane person...he said so at length earlier "@Entry X  Not ANC though 
1:04:27,1:08:15, This witness said they did forensic investigations for two years @Magda....this ‘investigation’ is just ‘fishy’ shem....don’t know how ‘extensive’ it could have been when ‘material witness’ like Agrizzi weren’t probed properly. Not my problem if you dont folliw or understand the details @Thamsanqa Zantsi Sounds like the SIU was interdicted from interviewing those witnesses. Agrizzi was still working at Bosasa...he inly blew the whistle recently after he left @Matthew Adams Yes - the ANC is the common denominator. The ANC is the problem. The arrest of Agrizzi was not based Commission evidence or the SIU report? Then what ‘Report’ or other ‘Reports’ was he arrested based on? Guptas and and Bosasa are two different issues.The Guptas destroyed all the SOE's...why dont people make a distinction between the two evils? Eishhhhhhhhhhh 
1:08:16,1:10:15, SIU report "@Thamsanqa Zantsi As far as I know something seriously soured between wATSON & AGGRIZZI I can see that some people dont understand what is goingvoncin their own country...very sad "@Derek Main Yes. He said so. Then how does the SIU conclude the investigation I will vote ANC because there is alternative or competition THE SUFFER THEN So Mti also interdicted? 
1:10:26,1:11:21, i will vote ANC because there is no alternative or competition #gcina nkosi Ignorance is bliss! LOL The SIU's job is to INVESTIGATE and hand over evidence to the NPAand SAPS..read their mandate...it is online @gcina nkosi You're a fool to vote ANC after hearing all this evidence of corruption. give options Did the Judge just point at the pick cap ?? no mic @Derek Main thanks for that clarity on the Hawks investigation 
1:11:22,1:14:26, Yin Yang ☯️That’s MSM for you! Captured! Yerr! they like their tea at this commission. @gcina nkosi your logic for voting ANC is strange. There can't be an alternative if you don't vote for one. i have no Time! "@Frik Brits I also that it was a guy with the pink cap but looking again Everything has been in thecpublic domain for many years ....more than the nine wasted years of Zuma..remember Bosasa was dominating tenders even before Zuma O my joined a few mins ago 😉 @gcina nkosi Do some homework yourself. There are 48 parties contesting. Read their manifestoes and decide which one serves you best. The one stealing the money is not acting in your best interests. People call briliant investigative journalists 'stratcom' but they wrote about all the corruption for more than a decade 
1:14:57,1:23:24, 😂 dominating in the proper way bra Makhandakhanda saw the opportunity there NWO ☯️ 😉 Claims that there is no altinative party to vote for has no basis only shows how steroo what time are they resuming guys Politicians always deny but since the Gupta emails was uncovered by journalists through whistleblowers who went anonomously to the media and Agrizzi coming forward peopke started talking and noticing. @Yin Yang I agree but look at the EFF trying to suppress media freedom @Pat Magwa I agree - it shows laziness. 
1:23:50,1:30:12, Corrupt politicians depend on the ignorance of the people they are supposed to serve I think the three tiers of government and state entities should be in school curriculums The people have a democratic right to hold office bearers accountable but Ministers are treated like Gods...they are there to serve the country not themselves when Adv Maleka is coming back guys? What just happened? Who are they talking about? She came back again? A lady who stood up last week indicating that she has info to share with the commission This proves the extent to which Correctional services implicated people and the NPA went to protect themselves and Gavin Watson from prosecution. 
1:32:17,1:38:28, He left in 2012 There you are @Thamsanqa...he handed over to the NPA and SAPS They were to busy receiving bribes from Bosasa And we are not close to a conclusion yet "A-Z @Planeless Pilot at this pace it can take another ten years to put the culprits in jail I am afraid that some of them will be dead by then @Planeless Pilot. 😂😂😂😂 "Breytenbach was hounded out of the NPA as she wanted action
