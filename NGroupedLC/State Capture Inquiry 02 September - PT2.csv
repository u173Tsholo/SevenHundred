32:16,35:24, our president is a liar. how can we trust Cyril Ramaphosisa? "Sometimes we need to take bold step to turn around strategy Hahaha am gay of course. But I did not insult anyone. Peace @Jack Sparrow the rate companies are currently retrenching is abnormal... @mxolisi buthelezi times are abnormally hard. The government is being abnormally flaky regarding policy and coherence. I agree with you. Something drastic needs to be done Cyril said half his salary is going to Mandela foundation. foundation must tell us where is that money and what is it doing @Thando Nkutha was just kidding dear When unemployment rises All gov employees must allow salary cuts.. starting with number one. So said Tito and I agree with him 
36:11,39:57, You are not reasonable @ Thando Nkutha. We can save this country until those employees whom seat information about looting come forward with evidence that shows I steal money without their corporate @Khulubuse Z Take a look in the mirror. Pay your workers you lowlife. @Derek Calm down he is not the real Khulubuze Zuma. lol This guy is clear. He knows his story @Sidney Setati And you know this how? Government is run by palookas!!!

45:33,50:24, ANC stuck in left leaning policies and they can't fund it!!! @Thando Nkutha sabc is overstaffed. get over yourself These are the things the Zuma foot solders don’t want us to hear and therefore I calling the inquiry a useless I agree with you @ Thando Nkutha 🔌🔌🔌🔌 🚥🚥🚥🚨🚨🚨 @Thando Nkutha peeped? Huh? Nope. Overstaffed - more people to pay then possible income. Leads to bankruptcy. Eskom is overstaffed too. Hard to comprehend? @Thando Nkutha Unfortunately either some people get retrenched or everybody loses their job. Listen to what DCJ is saying... Well considered opinion.. 
50:30,52:50, @Derek Main YOU MONSTER! Judge Zondo is 100% right here. DCJ is the voice of reason SABC is not sustainable using the current model. Give it up @Derek Main. You're arguing with a toddler I hope this guy doesnt drive a Toyota Corolla "@Thando Nkutha The SABC doesn't have enough money. If they don't fix the situation "@Thando Nkutha the minister was doin what was right for the ruling party for them to be voted @Jack Sparrow all your remarks are erelavent ie all corruption are what it is no overstafing is a meme for corrupt officials 
53:02,56:01, @Videoboer Lol... "he SABC doesn't have enough money. If they don't fix the situation @Thando Nkutha I'm not against the idea of the executives being canned first - they take far too much money with their exorbitant salaries. Sell it to the guptas South Africa starve and kill each other for cannibalism "Guys go to the SABC website and try to read some of their so-calls articles Better world without Inkatha Zulu party ace pls man @Thando Nkutha He might still have a job but for how long?

1:15:42,1:16:49, "You know you called yourselves Afrikaaners Black ppl do very well in USA sa Wil never recover The problem of Blacks in SA has a name. ANC No we don't indeed Penny Ace what %. I agree that you have hard working people of all cultures. you watch too much tv @Gee Peex1 He brought the SABC to its knees. He also interefered with journalistic independence. 
1:16:58,1:19:11, Sad thing he said is recovering looted monies will take years. That gets on my nerves @Thulani Bukani WHY DO YOU NEED TO ASK DOES THAT NOT PUT A RACIAL SLUR TO YOUR QEUSTION AND YES I AM AFRICAN American blacks are richer than most Africans @Gee Peex1 No probem - I'll also do some reading. Ace.. any capitalist can be successful be eating his own Because USA economy is strongest this is hogwash this commission is a waste of money in the 90s "@Danie I'm not fighting. and I'm not being racist. if me and you went to Asia and told them that we are African. anyone in his right mind will say no 
1:19:52,1:20:52, "We could do better "so you calling yourself African We should make our own automobiles China is the new USA @Gee Peex1 It would have lasted a while but not forever. He was taking too much money in salaries for himself and execs. Ace that's a general statement. break it down by how many people you talking about and what is the low and high between them. I have many work Americans of all colours. Raven Penny totally agree as this clown is only pushing that he has done such a fantastic job @Thulani Bukani why do we need to go to europe to prove what we already know the truth it is what is in your heart and not in your eyes @Thando True Those 11 conditions take away independence 
1:20:56,1:24:33, but many people unemployed at the moment. Bronx true @Gee Peex1 i thank you SA is the only country in the world that manufacturers guns from black makers "Economy needs to be at least 10% growth "It may take a war to take 10% of market share We Americans not fighting over crumbs. We take the whole table. "Nepotism Ok Danie. I get you. 
1:24:52,1:28:43, Hlaudi Motsoeneng was the starring of this movie... Cant wait to hear his silly side SA has diamonds and gold. How did you all mess it up? is he coming Sidney the whole problem is we have all the resourcers to MANUFACTURE our own stuf but no we will rather sell raw mats and buy back from china at cheap labour prices china does have poor slaves or underpaid SA has oil offshore "@Gee Peex1 Prophet Bushiri and Alf Lukau can surprise me You cray. cray. Old volcanoe have emeralds and rubies The SABC should e charging no less that R100/month for the licence. Each TV linked by a decoder. No decoder no viewership. Africa rich. Africans poor. 
1:29:16,1:31:19, ACE SA has ANC that's the issue. need new ANC members with a new outlook. Jo'burg has a big hole gold mine right there now that the SABC has competition from Mnet it is a problem for them @Gee Peex1 True acording to me the ulumunate decide on world prices but we a feew raw mats where the world depends on those are what should concetrate on How much do these Board members get paid? We must stop calling this activities Corruption and just call them theft so that Police can investigate immediately than all this commissions This dude is for real The big hole is in Kimberley....used to be a diamond mine. ANC has run its course but SA'ns supporting them haven't seen they light. Will go down with it UNLESS CR17 does something innovative in terms of economic growth. 
1:31:25,1:33:27, Born free ​ you and i would smile if we got it as well one big hole in Jagersfontein i lived there You all floated on the international commodities market that money changes every day Thando Nkutha ​he failed to come up with a strategy bar retrenchment and the committee disagreed with retrenchment rightly so.. This is NOT what he said!!!!!! How do you sign a contract that doesnt benefit your organisation but your competitor or suppliers? Kimberlite diamond caverns from volcanic action @Gee Peex1 yes we must pull a donald trump you fk wth us we will do the same There are too many board members getting paid mega bucks to sit on the board. @Gee Peex1 ​ make the money where it is at....in advertisements! Somewhere the decision is not yours? Like wanting to air football for free? 
1:34:08,1:35:30, Never trust politicians... Their decisions are not based of sound economic values but their political interests "@Concerned South African nope. that's not what he said. he did say that they cut costs by one billion i am sitting on a board right know and no mula is showing and now the wife want to take it back what really.. thanks 🖐 R2 billion lost due to sport. "2018 Salaries between R1 Thando Nkutha Are you listening to the part about not signing contracts that don't make commercial sense??????? I doubt I love to converse with Black people 
1:35:49,1:38:32, @Sidney Setati Couldn't agree more - NEVER trust a politician! The board members of medical aid schemes earn 100's of thousands rand (400 000 -500 000)for one board sitting. This is over and above their monthly salaries. Remove government from everything that it is not necessary Gabin Watson os not black Danie Nilsen I'm blocking. Your comment are inflammatory and racist. Government funding is your taxes @Gee Peex1 thought so The USA will be in a recession within the next 1-2 years. This guy may loose his job after this teatimony 
1:38:46,1:41:14, "Never mind all the free perks that come with these CEO Ace Spade ​Government funding is your taxes. Not everyone appreciates this..... Simple fact of life. sigh i am blocked for asking information why do you not block this looter talking now OG keeping it 💯 South Africa is dry land. Difficult to produce sufficient food so the people do not starve. Why make it harder? USA elected an unstable rogue as POTUS. He will destroy the USA. I pay my license only to have to watch repeats.. repeats @Cerebis USA elected an unstable rogue as president. "My favourite Adv 
1:41:44,1:43:35, @Born free What the Shoprite CEO earns in 1 month as salary alone a Shoprite teller will earn in 50 years. Obama was the Rogue along with Killary Clinton @Cerebis A mad man in the white house @Jack Sparrow POTUS stands for President of the United States @Ace Spade now that is a racesist remark withdraw please Yes Derek.. and the cashiers work long hours @Cerebis He wasn't elected by US Citizens. Putin put him there. Jo'burg You need a tax base 
1:43:39,1:45:10, @Cerebis We had our fair share in the past 10 years... Is time Americans feel what we felt The Republicans voted fairly and squarely for Trump. Victory will be Trumps 2020 "19 Radio stations and 5 TV stations @Gee Peex1 i agree all should feel free to post without prejudice or some radical blocking us when he or she does notagree wit my input @ANT CREATIVES LOL....I suppose Putin has now put his cloan Boris Johnson in London? Russia still intends to influence the 2020 elections. Employment in the USA is at an all time high. SA you can only do it together don' t be at cross purposes putin intervere with his own elections lol 
1:45:26,1:47:35, The Chinese are the influence of elections Russia has more platinum than SA "ANT CREATIVES You need to do you own independent research Putin takes out his opposition chinese if you count them they have n problem with erctions or did i understand you wrong hmmm? That's because they pay poachers to kill our Rhino SA you are finished it is communism run away @Pastor J i refer to asian cityzen residing in bahrain 90% of known deposits of platinum in the world are found in SA and Zimbabwe 
1:47:43,1:51:03, @Pastor J You are here mfundisi!!! How are you my dear sir!!! "Minerals in Africa +Thanks to the ANC "@Danie Nilsen You may not be aware and your are excused if it is so. But Kill the government and distribute resources to the people We should regulate the amount of platinum released into market to prop up the price - just like they do with diamonds. @Ace Spade resources should be used to develop the economy so that all that need can have jobs. give the mineral resources to the people and they'll just sell them to buy mercedes The ANC government has no experience just Political interference in every sector. @Pastor J if i ofended any of our asian brothers or sisters i aplogise was meant to the friends of zuma ie the guptas 
1:51:10,1:54:04, Privatise part of SABC assets... It will never make money until then @Derek Main Sibanye is starting to do that. There was however a lot of recycled stock in the system. @Gee Peex1 Hlaudi's busy hunting unicorns. @Danie Nilsen accepted with thanks Derek.. why did you support Fiddle Castro he did nothing for Cuba?? @Born free Who said I support Fidel Castro? "the more ganja i smoke Derek.. judging by your profile pic the two were a team. @videoboer Puff puff pass. 
1:54:52,1:58:48, @Derek Main @videoboer Have u seen me in the queue as well. Pass pass @Gee Peex1 It cant be bad. The very same DJ chairperson herein legalised the stuff. just kidding you cant cut essential services and then call it a turn around strategy. you've reacted to the conditions not met them. what is expected that you the standards with what you have. it wasnt us who stole and corrupted the SABC @Born free I support Che Guevara - I think he was a selfless man who championed the rights of the oppressed and downtrodden. He could have lived a life of luxury but made sacrifices. Why do you ask? "if the SABC goes down nothing is lost we can listen radio zambiA GET RID OF THE SABC Che Guevara 👌✌ HE IS ENQUIRING HE DOES MAKE A DESISSION 
1:58:54,2:00:20, Yey Thando Nkutha 😂 NOT His not making a decision. Thando Nkutha the fact that the SABC is useless is not an opinion.... its a fact AGREED "digitalemotionfilms ​if the SABC goes down nothing is lost yea now for a drink Concerned South African actually not - Im watching stream feed on eNews "Concerned South African SABC dont live stream
