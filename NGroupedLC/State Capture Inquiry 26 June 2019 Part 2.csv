time,13:59,message She got a profound knowledge of her job this lady This lady is an excellent witness! Need more SAns of this caliber is corporations. she is proper this one Simon you are correct this type of professional could have saved SA billions agree @abel brilliant witness Just get Zwane there. Get the cops to wait and march him off for charging processing. 😀😀😀 
14:19,22:44, hello i dont think so There's something very satisfying and being able to block Jacob Zuma. Love it!!! @jacob Watching the parly debate ne? Mduduzi Thabede ​@jacob Watching the parly debate ne? Doubt it. They may read numbers and that'll scramble his brain cell. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m impressed by the witness why were we muted before lunch things are heating up 
23:04,28:33, the Guptas and Gigaba in bed again Zondo has read this witness' statement and wanted to get to the meat of it. That's why he was so impatient this morning. I'm sure adv September is going to do better as well. But it’s unfair to the evidence leader Gigaba clearly showed up as having been emascuated Maybe suits were too tight then already... It appears as if Zondo picks on the advocate frequently @richard borain the issue is not zondo but the adv. who fails to articulate herself and own the show. she is still inexperienced and should never have taken this platform She is falling short of answering the question on what was her overall reaction to this guy outburst why didnt she asked him about the agreement he spoke about dcj Zondo is actually leading the witness 
28:49,30:08, Which is unfair hehe he eeh.. Jacob I can't wait to see you here next month.. don't forget your hankey cos you going to sweating under the heat ADV September is now Mabena😭 @Jayden Bango how else will she gain experience if she shy away from such platforms? Who’s mabhena Mabena Lol Lol "Jacob's opening gambit.. ""Cough..Cough.. Splutter Cough.. I have a cold""" @carnoth ngomane lol the lower courts. the comission has no time to tutor interns 
30:21,34:52, pastor JJ ..🤣🤣🤣💩💩 "@Jayden Bango i suppose shes been to the lower courts otherwise she wouldnt be here DCJ doing the job himself I can just imagine how slow Jacobs evidence will be..its going to a long four days.. 🤔😓 What a very bright witness....so articulate and intelligent... @carnoth ngomane my point is she cant come hear to show us her incompetence which the judge clearly sees all the time. this is not a polatform to learn. she is failing the simple things ... Guptas Jet Air company 🙈 This is embarrassing for all South Africans. The Indians strong-armed us and our representatives were like lapdogs.... Jet Airways has since been liquidated hooray! 
35:08,39:22, @Born free If they ask Zuma to read numbers of millions stolen. 4 days too short our people are captured because of the love of money. I’m seeing minister Nxesi dosing off in parly.. "@Jayden Bango i agree with you True "@carnoth ngomane .definitely Cricket much better- New Zealand in big trouble our hacker is back "@Bruce Andrew JUST thought Bruce. I was busy and decided to watch this. But nah 
40:00,41:29, @Jayden Bango perhaps budget constrains has compelled them to use rookies 🤣🤣🤣🤣 @carnoth ngomane thats also true. when is our president coming This hacker is trying to entice us with something 15th to the 29th July Zuma's rent a mob just getting municipal busses and ancwl shirts ready 😀😀😀 Why these people kept quiet for too long? What if this commission of inquiry was never recommended by Thuli? 
41:37,44:23, Zuma aint coming guys am sorry to inform u. do not raise your expectations Zuma to appear 15th to 19th July. Ex President. "Anyway This explains some behavior https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/politics/how-pentecostalism-explains-jacob-zumas-defiance-and-lack-of-shame/ar-AADs5ds?ocid=spartanntp "@Jayden Bango i dont him coming Zondo will issue a supeona if Zuma does not appear he will be arrested. I would rather lose a job than letting corruption to going on unexposed. does to appear means to testify @Born free Zuma is subpoenaed already isn't? 
44:46,48:12, @THABE PHALANE YES His name has been all over the show...he must now say his side subpoenaed? ??? Not sure Keith but his attorneys have responded and said he will appear at the commission. I am sure Zuma will apply delaying tactics. "Yes Eish Gigabyte "@Born free Yeah "I don't expect Zuma will take the stand Zuma and all his cronies and pals must stand trial for treason...... they have ruined this country just like Mugabe ruined Zim. 
48:45,55:36, @Thando Nkutha Thats all i know... subpoenaed to testify. Simple. A lawyer may act on his behalf or present him...if he does not comply. Lets not try to complicate its simple @Kevin Allister Simon He has no choice but to testify if subpoenaed This reminds of Clinton in 1998 lol "@Thando Nkutha Zuma and his lawyers clearly knows thats not allowed @Kevin Allister Simon I was a curious 14 year old back then... when Clinton was in a mess @Pastor.. haha yes Monica had his DNA @Pastor JJ Gosh... people here are so eager to show they know better than the other LOL. Crazy 
57:33,1:00:24, "@Pastor JJ I am not talking being comparative or talking from a comparative premise. Read my context. I meant mess in terms of ""subpoena to the Grand Jury. Ask first." who is mahlangu guys I am not here to prove am right than the other here... Jeez. I have gone past such levels...gosh Special advisor to gigabyte thanks LOL Enjoy the rest of the day people...I love you and let's move SA forward this is captivating and interesting.we are getting to the flesh 👍 
1:00:35,1:02:35, ✊🏿👊🏿 bye bongani this is the best evidence and narration in a long time i am watching from botswana and i am really enjoying this... Absolutely the best "I'm back This woman is an inspiration...so confident """if the president is asked to testify @Vincent Nthomang CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE HAVE HER CALIBER IN PARLIAMENT? 
1:02:36,1:03:58, Whatever She is saying is factual. also watching from Gaborone enjoying this too. Gigabyte mara... Inspirational but why they all kept quiet by then? @Bongani Mpapele True @Keith... Bill Clinton in the Oral Office. He was empeached but served his 8 year term. True @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU I guess fear ... I would love to believe that Gigaba was gigabyting her.@KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU 
1:04:16,1:05:17, lol Fear you right @Hester Ferrezuelo Ramaphosa admitted is Mr Daka the chair of SAA? @Bongani Mpapele He ate himself Who owned jet airways? """imagine in your mouth """ @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU really? I missed that Guptas owned Jet Airways 
1:05:27,1:06:52, "Wooow "@Hester Ferrezuelo she is better off in the corporate world driving the economy "Maybe this is the lady who was meant to receive that video @brian muleya I agree! "@Hester Ferrezuelo Yes Keith ramaphosa admitted what @Vincent Nthomang Yes you right "@Thando Nkutha ""dilika jele"" would be useless if Ace's people built the prisons coz the houses they build crumble in the rain. Most prisoners would want ""dilika Jele"" hoping for heavy rains soon." Gigabyte was strangled by Zuma 
1:07:30,1:09:50, "Was happy and was so attentive to hear what he was going to say...@Hester Ferrezuelo ""I was scared that i may or will be fired. But i knew time will come.""" Maybe Zuma taught Gigaba the Gigabyte Grip 🤣😂 looooool m from the Sona....what is happening today here quite some fireworks nyana "@Vincent Nthomang …. I can't help to think that Zuma's ""clever blacks statement"" was aimed at the likes of her to deter them from speaking out." "These guys were chawing our money 🤣🤣🤣 
1:09:53,1:12:04, @Bongani why do we keep voting them back into power @Hester Ferrezuelo it so sad tht some folks can subbotge their own country just to pocket a few millions...insane.I hate corruption @Vincent Nthomang and at whose expense? The government's own vulnerable people.... very sad indeed @Thulani Bukani Because you are afraid of what an EFF or DA-led government would bring to the majority. Chaos! "Even today @Thulani Bukani not saying you personally I'm with you Monique Corruption is cancerous to our country DPE was captured by GB 
1:12:07,1:15:24, MONEY CHOWING will never end but we should never give up the fight so our only hope is that the ANC fixes itself? Remember what the former ANCYL did to the Limpopo Province government? What we are going through now is history and there is a possibility of it repeating itself if we vote them in. DO THESE COMMISSION OF INQUIRIES HAVE TEETH????? they have constitutional teeth if we got all the SRCs around the country's universities to start a political party. do you believe those youngsters would be more corrupt than the ANC if they won an election? Yes @Thulani Bukani "I just finished very high quality response from our president "@Thulani Bukani they would be very corrupt 
1:16:17,1:18:14, Yes @Thulani Bukani @Vincent Nthomang Zondo findings and recommendations will be followed in the main I salute the President @makhosi nobhatyi I agree! There is hope. "@makhosi nobhatyi I also listened This is just a reality TV show. Yes it is Live not recorded @Cerebis that is not just a promises that is constructive programming for the next 5 
1:18:21,1:20:07, True SEXY @Jayden Bango thanx...i wish we could have one here in bots...i wish @Vincent Nthomang just for entertainment as well... lol I AM GONNA STOP TYPING BECAUSE I DONT HAVE DIVIDED ATTENTION @Bongani Mpapele Uthini manje? Articulates so well @Vincent Nthomang nothing ever comes out of these inquiries... @LYD online tv LOL Corruption is about self enrichment and NOT helping other peoples lives. I cannot imagine that Zondo has a corrupt bone in his body. 
1:20:36,1:22:34, @LYD online tv and we are here waisiting our emotions "We want all those who are implicated not use media platforms to address or attack credibility of the commission that shows denial from truth "@LYD online tv I disagree @Vincent Nthomang Yes! Just like watching the Kardashians... lol @Born free @Lex Luger "if politics need education its will better @LYD online tv 😎🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 YOURE FUNNY Cyril Ramophosas reply to the SONA was exactly the same as his SONA.. just pipe dreams. If I held a high position I would get my hands dirty through hard work and not corruption. I would love to head public works. Get the communities involved building 
1:22:38,1:26:58, @Jayden Bango hahahahahhahaha...!!! We will see but Jiba was not fired until administration changed. 3 years later... "@Cerebis being in parliament as a chair doesnt mean they are off the hook "@LYD online tv Agrizzi has appeared b4 a court together with the bosasa former CFO as a direct result of the proceedings that came out of this commission "QUESTION: What makes these people that knew there were irregularities not come out then - intimidation "Born free totally agree with you  I think fear of losing their jobs. @LYD online tv exctly what you suggested @carnoth ngomane I agree with you 100% it may be a plan done by Ace Magashule if it is to ousted President but they are not going to relax anymore as they will come in and out of court to ans corrupts @Peter.. he did not address Farm murders as per Groenewalds mention at the SONA. Very disappointed in Cyril He is just a dreamer. 
1:26:59,1:29:45, "Remember Born free he did not address the implicated people that are in charge of committees hE DID NOT ADDRESS THE TREATMENT THAT MY MOTHER IS FEELING ON FARMS Isn't the Hawks investigating Faith Mutambi for corruption "This lady is telling nothing but the truth True Peter there was so much he failed to address. "@Jayden Bango Fair enough. I just feel that the uncovered rot is deep through the many inquiries in proportion to few sample of consequences = little. Commissions: Esidimeni the women is my mento.. @Monique’s Makeup i am also curious what hapopened with that lady. i hope they wil haul her and hlaudi to this commission 
1:29:49,1:32:22, yah ndo tahela zwizhi vhathu vha khoula zwavhudi hafha musi @Bongani Mpapele I wish she would've told the truth then but it's still fine now... "@LYD online tv I will accept "dzimbava madaba-daba  @LYD online tv with Zuma's claws on NPA telling the truth then would have been fruitless @Christopher Maanda vhathu vho diphina rinne ro thalela thikhou toda u ambesa ndo tou imela zuma next month @carnoth ngomane Yah ne

Agrizzi...😁 @Thando Nkutha thats funny ma gupta haya GUPta again Adv September is all over the place recent future? 
1:40:20,1:41:46, lool he doesnt like her. yho she doesn't help herself either Zondo is ticked off yep lol Nuf respect for the Judge hey @Viwe Soga we have had no option for the past two days so lets live with it this adv is a little bit incompetent ndidzi mbava haya madithu 
1:42:01,1:43:17, She has been the worst evidence leader of all. Get that cheshire cat smiling dude that ticked off Jimmy Manyi @Sipho Owen Ndhlovu if she ever was Miss September is not asking online with previous witnesses she is contradicting herself heli lifani la Gupta neh liya mbvisa na tshitungu @Monique’s Makeup thats the best adv in the land Vincent Maleka SC Zondo is hard on Miss September My brother is getting irritated with the Advocate leading the evidence zondo ungari ofarwa nga khofhe nae "Maybe he should just let her carry on 
1:43:19,1:43:51, I think they are irritated with each other Nkululeko Zondo LOOLS... Your brother has patience tjooo 🙉🙉🙉 Cross-examine the witness on what they have said. @Monique’s Makeup you dont discharge all your deadly artillery at the start. you wait till the end he doesnt even allow her to balls it up before he intervenes. he looks for things wrong in her question before she finishes asking it. I said it..ADV September is Mabena of the evidence leaders She just wants to implicate Gigaba eagerly hehe Zondo is hard on Miss September 
1:43:58,1:44:58, I like him @Lex Luger. You don't know where he's coming or going @Tikvah Olam true that hey @Tikvah Olam you predicted right re; gigaba Wish tMiss September and Zondo are at loggerheads Miss September is having a bad day in the office im sure she wish this day is over already. @Sthakathi Khumalo Miss September is bad @Charles Nkadimeng ms spet. is being hard on herself @Monique’s Makeup and i enjoyed it a great deal when he put Manyi the fish in his place. It was so thorough😀😀😀😀 Perpetually picks on Mz September.....it should be brought to his attention Her hair is cute tho 
1:45:39,1:47:00, @Jayden Bango he is impatient with her since this morning i have not seen or heard anything articulate from this adv. "Zondo is correct @Monique’s Makeup the brain under her hair thats what matters @richard borain why do you think he does? She's been ineffective Mr zondo have mercy on her please she is trying @carnoth ngomane I didn't say it didn't matter I just noticed her hair is cute how much are they spending by the way on this commission as well.. why can't they just take criminals to jail and through away the keys ??????? I still SALUTE the Guptas... So much capture! 
1:47:10,1:48:20, @Monique’s Makeup i get you dissipointed in Zondo today hope he will be hard on Zuma also @Lex Luger 😃😃😃 Manyi was crying asking a protection from being asked questions which might contradict him coz he come alone without lawyer 😃😃 Procurement and Risk Management State sectors have been hijacked for years to date. @Christopher Maanda a lot of money Zondo is indirectly attacking the lead evidence leaders.they must pick better advocates Now this is where we should open our eyes!! Where are Black businesses benefiting because they dont!! @polla you think Zuma wants to get into the cat bird seat? Seems like the Guptas were in every business... 
1:48:25,1:49:55, @LYD online tv true that hey @Brian Muleya Every SOE... Even Land reform almost a year i guess if you follow this commission..ADV September is always in trouble due to her lack of preparation and poor at leading witnesses. Cannot have Miss September leading evidence to Zuma. @Brian Muleya that's how they finance all their family's elaborate weddings--on the backs of SAns @Legae Nyalungu Right! Zondo wants concrete and quality question to be asked which will be in line with testimony ndi vhudaba-daba 
1:50:10,1:52:26, @Monique’s Makeup They really did it big. lol @Born free true we would be doomed @makhosi nobhatyi correct.its not his job to arrange facts the Guptas were putting their fingers in every pie. Trying to to collect so much money within a short period of time. QUESTION: How come every witness besides Agrizzi is NOT admitting also having their hands in the cookie jar? @Diana Sekatane iAgree with u @Lex Luger nowonder how Zuma will respond on the matter? I doubt he will break down on cross questioning time The real reason she was sidelined... She sold out and teamed with white people @LYD online tv Because Agrizzi had an epiphany 
1:52:35,1:54:28, @Sthakathi Khumalo ........Eeeeesh....... The Guptas were not friends they were the enemy of SAs economy @makhosi nobhatyi Zuma is a denialist "the guptas were already rich and privileged before they came here What were your views on integrating black business?? Zuma does not know why are people on his case because he did not do anything wrong. She is really intelligent We have to thank Agrizzi. I wonder where we would be in this country if not for Agrizzi. loool 
1:54:28,1:56:07, "Its obvious @Thando Nkutha I agree! I worked for a company where she was the non Executive Chairperson. "@Lex Luger yes it is the Guptas were not that super rich but now they are. "Miss September not listening  @ Diane.. because Zuma is dumber than Dumbest. "@Charles Nkadimeng lol...exactly So what time is it there? @makhosi nobhatyi Absolutely correct. But you know the poor know nothing. They are the MABHENAs of politicians 
1:56:08,1:57:35, Nothing was right done by Guptas Is he SAs version of Prince Harry? Lex Luger 🙆🏻‍♀️😃😃😃 out of all that we can say about this witness what is outstanding for me is her eloquence and sharp mind I really admire her for these attributes The Guptas only became wealthy through Zuma and his Presidency. she is stealing the show now Prince Harry works for SAA? Zuma was in intelligence section of ANC he knows exactly what he is doing. And eating an Apple is healthy 
1:58:16,2:01:17, "@Diana Sekatane correction @Lex Luger You mean this? Epiphany = moment of sudden great revelation & realization? @Diane.. that's why the ANC fought for 107 years 🤣🤣 we need a break for sure No @Jayden Bango this is great and sad entertainment all at the same time Miss September really needs the break... There is nothing wow about `I mean`— [like really now..] She is hot thou😂 @Dian sekatane yes was there but nothing he achieved there accept transform those individuals to be mafias 
2:01:18,2:03:39, Oh really......Oh...really yeah September is not bad looking our country and the economy is in shambles. "hahahhhah "lol Judge Zondo giving Miss September a hard time.. he wants to cut to the chase. dont worry Ms September everythong has its time. Zondo didnt wake up a DCJ "..These Are those police man making sure Siza doesnt duck out ?? 
2:04:01,2:06:06, No understanding @ Lee Hendrix when is Nomvula coming if at all "I love Miss Sexy September Ms September is weak Ms. Buthelezi is the other one The microphones are hot. These learned people are ignorant. Miss Nutgel Right @Jayden Bango she has to learn and grow. She'll get there one day Miss Buthelezi is not experienced enough to lead Zuma either. 
2:06:18,2:10:24, Sexy September is my girl. RIGHTS GUYS enjoy all these details. I have to watch our BRADAS in their 2nd AFCON match. mzimela is very beutiful with so much brains Jacobo should be grilled be Gerrie Nel...then we would see the poppa dance.... Yes she is well educated which makes all the difference. "Lets just be honest now people @Thando Nkutha @Pastor JJ They are playing Guinea. I like it when West Africans play each other. They are huge and cancel each other nicely. They rob Bafana with their thunder legs i wander those who found guilty they wil be prosecuted or what will happened guys I believe the best advocate for JZ is Advocate Hofmeyr 
2:10:49,2:14:06, Maleka is the best @Gabisile Mabuza ....spot on Ja......Maleka ia also brilliant. "'Killer Kate' Hofmeyer will rip JZ apart but his testimony will have to be on a teleprompter in huge fonts. Don't ask him to recite any numbers whats the name of this chairperson people Maleka and his accent... 🤣🤣🤣true@Dan Brown Raymond Zondo "@Thando Nkutha the BIG 3 League is Hofmyer 
2:14:12,2:18:04, Maleka and the Oxford club...heheh Which one is Hofmeyer? @Dan Brown i mean the SAA chair they keep referring to @Monique’s Makeup she was here izolo "@Dan Brown He can read his bank statements in Dubai @Jayden Bango izolo? one x 6 plus 2 x 00 and 0ne 9 plus 6 and ninety eight and seven zero billion Rand.. said Zuma. 🤣🤣 ....Born free : that's is written and people choose a religion to avoid the reality that Man is male and female for reasons. ok 
2:19:43,2:21:41, judge who is day light why outsourcing when SAA has too many staff already. @Monique she's the white lady that takes no nonsense. You cant try your tricks with Hofmeyer I must've missed her @Monique’s Makeup she is not in today but i saw her yesterday morning "Gigupta is the snake in the grass. Someone is going to incriminate JZ She's always laughing with Zondo? I cant trace if she's english or afrikaans @Monique’s Makeup correct Yes @Monique 🤣😂 Zinto a 
2:22:03,2:25:58, zondo always cracking jokes when she's in town dudu myeni Thanks @Jayden Bango and @Thulani Bukani 🤣 Why is JZ bothering to say he's coming if he's not going to testify. Just sit there and Giggle? and look dumb. Adv Maleka to take Zuma on. i salute sizakele being on top of operational issue during your tenure controversy everywhere Zuma and his lawyers will cause problems for the commission... 
2:26:19,2:31:43, is advocate still around Salute DCJ ZONDO for doing 2 jobs today.... chair and advocate.... @Brian Muleya naw I think Zondo can handle them along with Maleka 😸 looooool I'm glad I'm on summer vacation the week Zuma shows up shots fired @Monique’s Makeup...😆what if they give Zuma to Miss September... I smell sewerage @Brian Muleya now you know that's like Trump visiting Africa. It ain't happening! 
2:31:50,2:34:22, Number One! booooooooooom yhoooo Zuma !!! this lady spilling the beans now "Former Pres. Must take them on using his vernacular. I believe his testimony will be helpful to the commission Number 1 is number 💩💩 Would he get up there and speak in isiZulu as his cuzzin Bathabile does when under pressure? the bot is back Number 1..has come up often 
2:34:54,2:40:49, But coding of number 1?? Is it a Fembot?? Comrade Zuma wanted to help his comrade friends.. the Guptas.. he saw nothing wrong in that. Welll...according to Jacobo...he can do No wrong.... bopha lezigebengu She could be saving herself.. she is smart Why do we black people like fighting one another though? Instead the enemy benefits from these things nje fihting Jacobo thinks he's a Savior ... 
2:40:52,2:51:41, figting is h True...the enemy are the...Commies/Socialists etc figting is human @MIKE LOCK the enemy is anyone participating in corruption. ANYONE!!! @Monique’s Makeup ......100% correct...all of them must do jail time...All I need more coffee. Not even 10 am and I need a nap!
