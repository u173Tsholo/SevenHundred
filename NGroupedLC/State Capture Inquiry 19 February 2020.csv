Everybody seemed to be doing things the way they want it to be ja neh I like when she says thst contradictions ms Dlamini "So true Tulonga Language is a problem "She is actually correct that all employees at SOE's regardless of what position you hold you must be vetted and declare your interests quarterly 
50:16,51:55, Gareth 🤣🤣🤣🏃🏃🏃 Thuli Madonsela must come here and dish em files. the commission can conclude in 1 day "Language is a problem even between speakers of the same language Ms Dlamini please fake sickness Very true@mokopa .

Who is the witness and what is her role please? I'm new to the inquiry...who's this lady and how is she implicated in the state capture 
57:50,59:45, you separate from and not to Ms Dlamini She is the next PP @wim louw 😆😆 @Eliot Chauke . If Zuma was elected directly by the public and not the ANC NEC I doubt he would ever have been elected to be president. Many dont regard him as their president. U are an exception #Granny-any academic qualification should be seen as a stepping stone-practical exposure gives substance. @Pastor J - agree she is the daughter of black south African father who De kerk failed to kill. Elliot Chauke keep on dreaming. JZ is the president of his cult NOT SA! The witness is Ms Dlamini from SSA and is responsible for vetting. she is a chief director 
1:00:12,1:01:38, @Pastor J. you forget that Zuma is more popular than Ramaphosa. People love Zuma.. its a fact. Thanks @Singi Mathebula Ms Dlamini knows her story. Against foreign Nationals; balance checks She is queen Red Dlamini @Eliot Chauke ...I respectfully but utterly and totally disagree with you. Zuma is your President. like it or not #Eliot-dream on!! @Eliot they also love Dudu Myeni because of her patronage 
1:01:44,1:03:58, Look at how Cyril won Conference. vs How Zuma won Raised like parks and recreariom ANC went below 60% under Cyril... Zuma was always above 60% We need statues of Zuma in front of all South Africa prisons @Chauke thieves masquerading as RET love JZ not us the voters and uncaptured members of the ANC We must start with the Murderer De Klerk statues @Eliot Chauke. it seems they gave you overdose when joining Zuma cult Can’t handle... It was a typical case of a fairer sheep leading the goats to the slaughter.They had a smile on their faces sadly whilst being slaughtered. Thats like a cult @Eliot Chauke 
1:04:15,1:05:30, All ANC members are captured Agreed @Cruda that's where he belongs @Cruda Just goes to show I’m right voters should have IQ test to vote. who is testiying now? this looters never thought that their corruption will be exposed they used woman its miss Ndlamini @Thokozile Mokoenanyana In your estimation how many official members of ANC are not captured as a percentage? Ramaphosa is Captured by corporates Lo sisi bekumele ucele ukuthetha ulwimi lakhe coz andiqondba uyaziva. Uthetha eziphikisa 
1:06:06,1:08:17, I'm sorry but this lady does not give me the confidence that security personal should have. all this people have smallernyana skeleton Ramaphosa is captured by consensus. Zuma stole from the poor he claimed to represent. Cyril is stealing from you as we speak @Singi @Dominic Przybylski - agree - he's caught between a rock and a hard place CR17 campaign is the root of State Capture... done in broad daylight. Collective responsibility castrates leadership. @Eliot Chauke ...True...the Commies are trying to capture ...Everybody...... 
1:08:42,1:10:44, Is it really language tripping her up or incompetence to grasp questions...I mean she couldn’t even understand ‘it’s on the spine’.. I’m worried about such people in important work places... i think they are political employees since the minister is the employer Cyril never and will never stole from me because Zuma never shared a cent with me@Eliot Chauke "Help me today...please dear father @wim louw - huge EISH! "Eish Bathabile for VP @Sivuyile - she's in a very difficult place "@wim louw ...hehehehehe. The same Carl Niehaus that ""killed"" his mother to borrow money again!!!!!" 
1:10:49,1:13:15, Does she understand what vetting means. @wim louw - even bigger EISH! 😂 @Pastor J pastor j I thought Carl Niehaus mother must get a Nobel peace prize for Resurrection 2nd after jeaus @Jimmy Reddy ...A Beeeeeeg Amen to that. This is hostile wittiness or stupid @singi your reasoning is funny. Cyril is stealing from you. wake up. IPP are coming Shamila must fall ...Ms Dlamini for ND NPA! "@Spider 
1:13:50,1:16:34, this lady seems to be confused maan @Jimmy Reddy That's the best thing we can do. There is too much evil in our country. pastor j Carl Niehaus is a con man finish and klaar She sounds defeated. I bet her undies are full of brown haha Funny how the Commie brain thinks...especially the Elite ones....they Always seem to have all the little ..... "Surrounded by a whole lot more of them Conmen. @Elvis Malakoane . Now working for Ace I hope Ms Dlamini will be finished cannot take this. Feeling sorry for her though I don't know her @Dominic don't be fooled by rented crowds or instant members who know nothing about the ANC which are few in any case. People are victimised if they don't blindly follow I know since I am 1 of them. pleasures in life.......but the Others.....have nothing......funny that hey.......... 
1:16:42,1:28:05, pastor j true that Miss Dlamini is the victim here @Cruda Bex How is she victim??? "In the ANC @Dominic Przybylski You can even google me. I nearly killed in 2007 for not supporting JZ and standing up to Ace when he wanted me to refuse the branches desire when they chose me above Thabo Manyoni. @Dominic Przybylski as Motheo regional chair which I won and 2 days after that 5 bullets rained into my house 2h40am.

I believe his mother did die eventually. What again? 
1:37:13,1:41:33, Eventually after about 5 ressuructions. I believe the 6th was not a success. Carl eventually gave up..@Pansophical Sceptic This witness is assisting the Hof in cornering her this is very relaxing Where is Mr X she is getting shook runnig ftom dudu Carl Niehaus is a classic case of moral power failure Where? @House MusiQ ZA he completed yesterday

But a bad defect..@Elvis Malakoane I think perhaps the SAA should have vetted the SSA. I dont think she is beating around the bush. she seems unprepared and inexperienced. true pastor stem looks like they were playing her because they new what can happen 
1:47:38,1:48:50, Kate is finishing her now what side are we rooting for? Dudu s puppet Looks like it Was she vetted for her position? I doubt it. Is the President's security staff clearance up to date with who bet bad she seems unprepared This was employee abuse amen @ Collen

Mr. Y Maybe grade 2 Next one will be Mr Z Miss Myeni learned a lot frm JZ to corrupt the whole family 
2:48:02,2:49:26, Can’t wait for witness Ms. # lol Mr Yoh....Yoh....Yoh !!!!!! X and Y. Does this relate to a poly graph? @pastor J When is ms M going to testify? @Lerato Ramadiro As I said 12 are standard then more can be asked but 12 are compulsory Zandile and Miyeni realy mastered the art they learned from Zuma Not at all my friend. We had MrX recently. I was wondering if they are discriminating against MrY and Z@Pansophical Sceptic what if Mr X is Jacob Zuma? 
2:49:39,2:50:39, "I'm grt to watch this panel on State Capture Inquiry. Lots of lesson to learn from South Africa to the rest of the West "@Dominic Przybylski She doesn't have money for transport ms M is nowhere to be found Mr Y is Malema Can't wait till we get to Dr No then Pastor! you right Panso! The fitness of some witness to hold certain positions is really questionable looking at the way they interact with the evident leaders eish!! @thabelo justice mulokwe ...That would be Mr Z what is a dunderhead or dunder brain?👋 @Anne M. Ms M is rolling in the money she got from Mr X

We may also try and use Mr JZ for that one All starting to sound like alphabet soup! Cluedo's got nothing on this game 😀 What I understand is that rr Z got only R2million from the cash of mr X so ms M helped herself to about R8 million of it. Kate go on lunch please leave Mr Y Malema would never come with animinity attached because he wants people to see and hear HIM. He wants to portray no fear.
