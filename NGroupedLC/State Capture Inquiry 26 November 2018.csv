2:53:30,2:56:06, @peter pott explain Manyi reveals that its a lie that the New Age took all the money from GCIS. Only 4.5% went to the New Age. White owned Naspers took R17.9 million they are going to punch his tyres in the parking The right to exist on the part of TNA is not wrong but how it came into being and how it operated is what is in question here. guys..what happened to ann7 and new age White collar capture of the state. @Valencia Makola now what about those who says the Guptas hired ministers? where is their proof? evidence? what do they have to back their allegations? admissible or not "Manyi Manyi presentation is based on figures.....it takes away the inflammatory narritive
