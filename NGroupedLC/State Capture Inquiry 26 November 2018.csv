2:43:20,2:45:16, @Valencia Makola No me and u are not in court but are on public opinion and evidence have been provided to that effect by govt officials anyway and under aoth. Do u ignore that as well lol I guess people in the chat have no work @Joas Masilo Hiine yes i did then that's all the proof you need "@Joas Masilo Hiine The leaks that have not been verified and inadmissable in the court of law? Same leaks that were leaked by the media? LOL Which business people don't influence government appointments? Why is this practice only condemned when practiced by some but ok with other business people "Ppl Will Show It In Masses "@Joas Masilo Hiine you are clutching at straws on those so called Gupta leaks 
2:45:19,2:48:05, @Nelson Musoliwa Don't tell me about public opinion. Back up your claims with evidence proving that the Guptas appointed a minister. @Joas Masilo Hiine . wonder why are you on their side so much. that doesn't proof a thing @Trucker admissibility of those emails have nothing to do with this. the fact that the Guptas themselves did not dispute the authenticity of the should tell you something... Manyi must explain stats are based on holding companies @Thato M . true Are we not hearing it for the first time that business people hire and fire ministers Thato i may be not updated perhaps are u "@Joas Masilo Hiine the law doesn't work that way @Joas Masilo Hiine You're wasting our time.

2:50:00,2:50:49, Do Not Be Blind Manyi put himself in the corner with comparison side effects of corruption is a shinny head like Manyi's @Nelson Musoliwa LOL bro you're accusing the Guptas of all these things but no one has produced any solid evidence. Not even Pravin. Shouldn't the accuser be taking the lead? @S'boniso Qwabe . lol Whoo Shem! Caught by the Chairperson’s question and now backtracking! "Manyi statistics are on point @Trucker same goes for anyone alleging that the Guptas hired ministers. produce evidence @Thando Nkutha Look how that turned out for Phumla Williams. 
2:51:04,2:53:16, "If So "@nkutha @Joas Masilo Hiine . u must also produce evidence that the didn't. hebanna Didn't this guy FINISH his testimony the other day? I thought Manyi is here for questioning' "But Manyi "Manyi on Tiso blackstar Tiso Black star "Why is it difficult to grasp a simple point that a party who got 4% of the stake can hardly be said to have ""captured"" government? It's a blend of logic and arithmetic." Chairperson doesn't understand proportionality of revenue spend. National Treasury uses a similiar basis for various departments. He unfortunately mistaken 
2:53:30,2:56:06, @peter pott explain Manyi reveals that its a lie that the New Age took all the money from GCIS. Only 4.5% went to the New Age. White owned Naspers took R17.9 million they are going to punch his tyres in the parking The right to exist on the part of TNA is not wrong but how it came into being and how it operated is what is in question here. guys..what happened to ann7 and new age White collar capture of the state. @Valencia Makola now what about those who says the Guptas hired ministers? where is their proof? evidence? what do they have to back their allegations? admissible or not "Manyi Manyi presentation is based on figures.....it takes away the inflammatory narritive
