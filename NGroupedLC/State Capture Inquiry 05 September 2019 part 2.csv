I was born in the wild that's what makes me born free. @Born Lol..Whatever "I think so 
1:35:34,1:40:45, True under a thorny bush tree Question time was not bad at all I loved Question Time. that guy was dealing with the issues. This is the time when the South African government is given economic sanctions to see if they can bring about development in their country. "do you know Guys that when you do this chaos (burning of trucks) we all get affected as we are in the same region @Anne M.Thank u .In Sesotho we say kea lebohea..Meaning I appreciate it @Kopz Koape 😃 you're welcome @Sipho Dube.. I agree it has such an impact that many shipping companies are not wanting to do business in South Africa. "kopz be-careful 
1:40:56,1:43:44, it because of this barbaric behavior @Sipho then the gov should ensure that employers hire only south Africans problem solved getting a job is one's favor "we can never be the same South Africans don't want to work as well as foreigners and companies are sick and tired of protests. whether u are a South African or foreign nation "Lol some comments though we also need to fix the problem of entitlement as many people would prefer to hire foreigners because they work hard when south africans tend to act like the job is their right yeah 
1:44:43,1:47:05, @ Born free that is not true most south African want to work..We want decent wages that's all. White employers are greedy and wanna maximize profits where are the whites doing maths lol do you see talking about this attacks on foreign national I think owning a business in this country is risky to say the least. they probably saying that :we should kill one another "Remember aliens are the catalyst for social development "imali yeqolo and refuse school as if they will remain young The image of South Africa is taken into consideration 
1:47:13,1:52:42, "and your country would suffer more because it is ur soil sipho what is your profession? this is south africa and that means that south africans and LEGAL immigrants are first inline Do you think those shop owners are illegal? some of them are i know a few local businesses here in the suburbs of jozi that arent exactly legal Interesting.. conspiring against Pravin Gordhan. Do you even know what is an immigrant? an immigrant is someone who crossed the border legally "Shaun 
1:52:55,1:55:02, not the nigerian whos filtering his money through a small business This country is in big trouble. Evil forces are at work to make everyone hate each other. I wou We are south Africa we can survive because the world needs us more then we need them as proven when the world had sanctions on us during apartheid why when a black tries to fight poverty another black men interferes? no weapons of the wicked shall harm us we will kill each other Gordhan had his special Investigative SARS team investigate Malemas Italian sponsor for tax evasion. 
1:56:24,2:00:30, Shaun be realistic my bro "no Shaun "At present South Africa has no foreigners those who come to South Africa legally pay to be here Do you know that Shaun? "if the shops are not legal then your government has it's own issues to uzobona mhla no shipment comes to RSA and no one out that your country has a problem Zuma tricks "Up until South Africa they did not go to law and how to do business without a permit 
2:01:18,2:05:22, This myth also just be a plan to make all blacks hate themselves because if we are together we are stronger. someone is wanting to bang our heads together. I wish we can all see it. I believe PG was hatred by these gangsters "Shaun at least you are communicating which mean you have been to school Jimmy Manyi 😳😳😳 a lazy person is worse that the one who destroys looting will never make u rich. Get involved in an activity It was clear that they are fighting Gordhan because he is the clever man who will expose them "if someone comes to ur own house without ur knowing 
2:05:47,2:11:33, For this the South African government must be held accountable for ongoing events. chair you now out of odder chair ...look at your watch whomsoever put the idea of government will do for us RDP water electricity and imali yeqolo was a fool even if they entered wrongly then your government should know that some of your people have helped them. No one can pass a secured entry if a person inside does not hide him in through a hole So your guys are helping Nigerians in illegally "If he does not follow the law he cannot build that house unless he has followed the rules and regulations he can build greatman what are you trying to say? who are you? greatman u do not know anything about immigrants 
2:11:53,2:22:05, just shut up please Do you even know about visas and permits? what was the number? anyone managed to note the number? I wanna check something south africa doesnt have a problem with legal immigration it has a problem with illegal immigration there is a difference you know "Remember even other countries have your people i gaurentee all the south africans in nourthern africa most likely are there legally because theres no point in going there illegally but violence is never the answer our saving grace will be commisions like this because we face corruption and if we dont get rid of corruption our borders wont be protected and we will keep going 
2:22:11,2:29:17, in this direction xenophobia lack of services and all this things stem directly from corruption and downright incompetence we deal with the source of the problem and all the symptoms will dissipate no i believe that they have all gotten here due to the corruption that trickles down from the top and i believe that they shouldnt be here and they are a drain on our society they must go focus on your own countries problems fight for your country dont leave your people behind to deal with them without you "Now I understand you theres no slavery in south Africa and i dont support theft and violence but i understand where it comes from and why its happening Yip. More woman abuse...by the ANC cadres this time 
2:29:55,2:39:10, Hlaudi's bullies please just shut up... it's better The main problem of SA -NOTHING HAPPENS ! Road Rage 😲 Scary stuff "Let's be one of the Africans that built our continent Intimidation You will need whites to design. "How do you 
2:39:55,2:44:43, My brothers are blood related as are my sisters. This poor lady lived through horror!!! "Yes Since when do black people in SA refer to blacks from other countries as their brothers and sisters?? They should call this Ungerer-guy to come and testify! @Born free are you listening to what this poor lady is saying? Yes it's horrible "is horrible on who.s instructions 
2:44:58,2:50:53, I hope other companies who use Schindler Lifts will insist that Ungerer is not allowed on their properties. Mr Ungerer perhaps now at Elevator Modernization Specialists ? sounds like the shinndlers list horrable Do you know him @Antonie Goosen ? I only opened it now... what are talking about? "It's terrifying being chased @Antonie Goosen Probably not a coincidence Curious to know why he chased them I just want to say the ANC is corrupt. 
2:51:25,2:53:44, "Schindler said it was road rage that is my qeustion too and who gave the instruction or is he a creepycrawly stalker "Ok He wanted to frighten the ladies because he is an idiot. what was the guys first name Still starnge that he is also connected to the SABC Thugs. Jan Ungerer? and where is the capture of state 
2:54:27,3:06:19, poor Zondo..he probably llies awake at night after hearing all these terrible stories for so long Who wants to work at the SABC?? "i feel for this lady but also feel it is wating real state capture like in axce wasting aces case now we are talking name dropping ZUma also tries the spy card. I feel soooooo sorry for this lady! Same - so unjust and cruel 
3:07:34,3:16:10, And the people throwing around the spy claims know how dangerous it is to make that claim. "The SA/ANC government is apparently one of the largest purchasers of electronic spyware I think it's her married surname Married to the Mbeki brothers @Gee Peex1... ...one of! "Was disclosed in US congress Is she married to Moeletsi Mbeki? Yes @Reward Mushayabasa ! Thanks@Bongani Maqabuka 
3:17:49,3:33:16, No - the supplier / developer had to make full disclosure. Think SA was one of their largest clients I think it was in one of the Wikileads documents - should find it again. "FinFisher produces and sells computer intrusion systems "Specifically Lol will eard about it. "Very scary. I had interactions with high level ANC members and told that their spying is seriously scary - even their own members are monitored constantly "But Zondo is a skelm They do - and have the finances I hope she is safe 
3:36:55,3:39:18, "Had a client "No where is motsoeneng...kkkk The problem is that it is abused - power corrupts and is later used for personal and political gain south Africans what are you doing........???? @emma matela That would be a circus 😉 bail outs bail outs bail out.... Where is that crazy fool Hlaudi now? "Yip 
3:39:21,3:41:24, @anne...it would be climatic Didn't Hlaudi start a political party? lol Yes! He got TWO votes.....😂😂😂😂 He voted for Hlaudi and Hlaudi voted for him. And didn't he lose his deposit? @JS Bach 😂😂😂 @Anne M. Yes! 😂😂😂😂 Supposed to be used for marketing purposes but adapted for spying on its citizens 
3:41:38,3:43:43, Couldn't have happened to a nicer person /S does hlaudi pay a tv license? hope that he appears @Anne M. Yes!!! Idiot!!! And Adv Gcabashe must grill him "@threedeespace He's to busy speaking to this Hlaudi Sjhould leave Zondo alone with Hlaudi in a locked room @Anne M. or Hofmeyr @Diss & Dad Yes its honest intended use 
3:44:05,3:46:03, I Hlaudi should have Advocate Kate Hofmeyr. She will put him in his right place @Reward Mushayabasa Yes I agree. She is the best. 👍 Thats what the malware can be used for lol freeks whens hlaudi in the hot seat? @threedeespace the freak in the purple suit. Yuck! whos in the purple suit the joker?
