0:53,10:29, Ayeye. Nanzo bro there is so much gun shots by me it crazy This intern is promising. bihind my house there a whole bunch of gun shots its crazy 7 de laan crazy numbering system The Commission hasn‚Äôt yet devised a format for labelling it‚Äôs own folders! It‚Äôs ironic that they are unveiling incompetence in parastatals when they themselves look like they‚Äôre struggling. Filing is really confused! it always starts as a commission of filing and bundling 
11:03,16:53, Why don't they sit with the chair in his office agree prior start of commission to get the filing correct! just to involve us because it has to be on record ayii I hope they won‚Äôt adjourn for the purpose of sorting out the filing. The commission should develop and promoligate Directives on paginating and bundling files and exhibitsü§ûü§î maybe its another tender Agree Vurivi the chair creating confusion AFRICAN TIME AS USUAL 
16:56,23:37, Stop rather why is clown so far off the system that the whole team should be using and why can he fix it during lunch or tea time? it has to be on record does it need to take 30 minutes to gethere? the way this guy is coughing ü§î i guess this lady is early 20's (22/23) "This is nothing else than a circus is he havin a flue üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ i think so 
24:22,35:47, yeah:goodvibes: Another bunch of excuses for not appearing. These people who should appear must be prepared to pay the costs of the wasted time? And the commission bundles along:goodvibes: mr. zondo pressing his lips very tightly together. maybe "Mister chair  MR. ZONDO IS MORE SERIOUS ABOUT SOME OTHER EXCUSES for the future always a directiv or supheno for all . Subpoena everyone then so that everyone to appear before commission otherwise their will be more delays!
