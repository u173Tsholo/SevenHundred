1:11:30,1:16:03, 1000 cows in milk at 45lt per cow would require bulk milk tanks with a 45 000lt capacity. I have yet to see those size tanks on one farm. "South Africans are not lactose intolerant.

Fix the sound it‚Äôs coming on the left side only Zuma will have to come he can't just start something and leave hanging on a thread A laughing hyena does not have any stress not nearly as much as our ex president waisted on himself and they done nothing with it ................ 
2:01:42,2:04:59, we are a rich country ... oh way not anymore not anymore bee This is the reason Africa is a failed continent and has to depend on handouts and aid from Europeans. our people 's struggle standing at streats hungry.. NO work while some steal our countries money...... no his own people turn there back..... It's the government people that steal the money. no ..... Land belongs to the people who paid for their land and who have title deeds. Zuma is a coward 
2:05:04,2:06:06, not anymore how many billion were taken by individual bee No free squatters and land grabs. We don't want more shacks around our neighborhoods. Go make your own. land is taking and will be taken @Belinda Niemand Government land is being taken. Private land is being stolen. Blacks want everything for FREE=EFF we are the next Zimbawe 100% Correct. No where in this world do you get to have land for nothing. 
2:06:18,2:07:50, Hallo Fifi free .... yep and prices go up ... Rand drop .... worthless "@Born free Indeed Rand is nearly R16 to the Dollar @Belinda Niemand Kruger Rand! Buy your cars and motorcycles now. no go steal it "Most importantly @I Am Free Almost yes 
2:08:16,2:12:14, LOW "Thando don't entertain them. Just take the land and they keep talking @I Am Free I bought 350 000 rand's worth of Kruger Rand before the rand collapsed BEE has ruined this country. Where in the world do you see this terrible practice against a minority. All the experienced people have left. @I Am Free II knew it was coming Blacks had tribal land. Whites paid for their land. @I Am Free When we're officially in 100% junk status we lose all investments from other countries. Give it another 10 years i love this adv she's so beuatifulüòç 
2:12:27,2:15:17, Lol Land for what? More shacks. If you paid for the land it is not stolen. Blacks did nothing with the land . Land to do nothing with ..... "@Born free I am not giving my farm away. My weapons are loaded Load that gun "If you're in South Africa @I Am Free Become a member of USAF "@I Am Free You can invest your money into kruger rand with the ""pay app""" 
2:15:37,2:18:16, Looks like we're going to be neighbors On pc it's very small i have to check your profile üòÉ "It will start with unused land Black people are being fooled into believing they will own land. the truth is the government will own the land and charge for it by leasing it. Nothing is for free. Who is government...I see black faces there. "@Born free EFF/ANC/BLF is using Hitler's old tactics Those idiotic parties will go down in flames. @Born free I agree My brother DCJ please give Miss Molefe more time to lead the evidence 
2:18:50,2:24:56, Jay Bharat i love me jam bu Kashmir jay hinda @I Am Free How is the weather? I'm in JHB Nkululeko Zondo uyamthanda u advocate Because you see open land it does not mean it can be used for human habitation. There are many geotechnical and environmental reasons why some land cannot be used. @I Am Free Indeed! The Chinese bought a huge piece of land above Port St Johns where they are busy with plans for a Mega City. Remember China is bankrupt and imploding with 52 million empty homes @Solly 12 yes too much. But im scared of my wife LOL "The Chinese are amongst the most intolerant people towards immigrants @I Am Free I actually like the manners of the Zimbabwe people. They don't involve the race card every 2 seconds. "Yes  
2:26:53,2:36:34, @I Am Free We can see the globalists took control of South Africa when Zuma/Ramaphosa started getting comfortable with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton "Why do you think that China is not being a place where immigration presents as a problem  @jasper dougal People are rushing to get out of China "@jasper dougal Tourists going in are usually captured into prisons  neither "How can the economy grows @I Am Free Actually not a bad goal @Nkululeko Zondo The Economy can grow when thee people stop abusing our taxes and grant services. Including stopping the daily corruption and Riots. "@I Am Free I understand what you mean 
2:36:43,2:43:30, @I Am Free The stress that comes with high paying jobs. I know couple of people with high paying jobs who have lost their health due to the high demand of their jobs. its a shame. Some have divorced and cannot be with their loved ones "@Nkululeko Zondo I'm working for mainline engineering as a civil engineer Personal life doesn't matter with higher paying jobs "@I Am Free More money We live in a World now where the people know the cost of everything and the value of nothing ! Capitalism has brought us to this @jasper dougal I see other humans as NPC's. The NPC theory explains what happened to our Politics. Capitalism is the mother of fascism. @I Am Free I can be happy off grid with no electricity. But the danger in South Africa made that possibility nearly impossible to do it. 
2:43:42,2:47:47, "What you sharing guys is indeed true and sad reality Stop the gravy train. "Capitalism has attached a cost to everything  Trickle down doesn't work and never will. Those on top always use bigger and bigger glasses so not much trickles down. If they take away property rights 100%. South Africa will be in chaos no doubt. "There is no CEO on this earth who deserves the salary that they get paid Have you guys seen the laws they are trying to amend? They are trying to make it legal for Trespassers. "Just how much money does one need before you say enough  The Shoprite CEO wanted his salary increased to R33 mil pa!!! That's without shares options and other benefits. A teller in a Shoprite store would take 50 years to earn what the CEO earns in 1 month! 
2:49:12,2:51:07, Capitalism is a disease. "When inequality exists as it does now  If land is easily Available then go work a job and pay for it. That easy. We need a revolution. @jasper dougal The Inequality is on all minorities. BEE is basically apartheid. "We need for there to be fairness  You would think - but greed knows no limits. This lady should just enter Miss SA once I will watch Miss SA for the first time if she does 
2:51:42,2:58:23, @jasper dougal Indeed they blame apartheid but that's a easy card to play. They never explained why Apartheid happened or who had the first apartheid in South Africa "If you could choose  The British Imperial Army had our Minorities under concentration camps to starve to death including my great grandfather. That was the first Apartheid in South Africa. Blacks sold their own as slaves. "@jasper dougal - if you don't have brains Zulu's and Bantu's because they invaded on a huge scale the British Imperial Army could not capture or kill them all so instead they arranged with the leaders to buy people and sell them as slaves. "@I Am Free Both sides "@I Am Free I just finished reading completely "@I Am Free You have a bloodline of survivors This Commission is just Window dressing for the masses. What can they do if everyone chooses to take it on Review? 
2:58:51,3:05:41, They would be in Court for years to come lol They have destroyed South Africa... this is the pyramid scheme that pretends to be a government: the ANC/ "At the end of this everyone implicated will demand a review in Court and then what  None of the facts established here will count for anything in your HighCourts. So it‚Äôs a very expensive waste of time "It‚Äôs a smoke and mirrors act  she is gorgeous and very competent. Pretty privileged ! "ANC won't be a majority party because of this. When they lose votes Puurrrr
