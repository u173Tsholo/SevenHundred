He should say that's a lie Mr Jonas is a straight talker and is not panicking. different to Vytjie Mento it's way too early on this commission "you can simply tell that he has nothing to hide @Yin Yang. Imagine you go apply for your ID document at home affairs and they tell you that your ID will take 6 months because it must come from China. EXPOSE HIM!!! 
1:08:32,1:09:52, Why is Duduzane trying so hard to protect the Guptas? "He is one of the credible witnesses LOL UNABLE TO COMMENT ON THAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN JONAS???!!! This man has no reason to lie...He refused R600m and was fired! @Dylan puppet masters Did the confrontation Holongwane talk about occurred in gupta house. @Dylan Burden Duduzane knows who butters his bread. simple "Dylan @Dylan Burden. Duduzane Zuma once said that to be where he are it was because of Guptas. Therefore he will try by all means to protect them. 
1:10:02,1:12:01, #Dylan Burden ... To protect his interests - you surely must know the connection? 😬 Glad it's plain as day to everyone. @Yin Yang. Really!!!??? Hi @Moira T ! Hi 👋🏻 "LOL RAISE YOUR VOICE 😂🤣😂🤣😂 Mr Jonas is clean as his head. "There is quite a fine web of lies in the statements of these three viz. Zuma 
1:12:36,1:14:04, @Sofia Sofia - Do update us also with death tolls in Cape flats too. @Yin Yang. This is what was going to happen here in SA. Where head office would be moved from Pretoria either to China or India. @Sofia It was 40 this morning...tragic Mcebisi Jonas’ foot tapping says a lot about his panic😂🤣😂 "I imagine they will have to go through each person's evidence and establish who is the most The whale called Jonas should have kept him inside to be disolved hehehehe MCEBISI JUST ADMITTED THAT HE LIED ABOUT DUDZANE TAKING HIM TO THE AIRPORT!!😂🤣😂 White people think they own the road in the mornings @Desmond Masilela still today the head office of South Africa is in Chana.

SO THERE WAS A GUPTA BROTHER BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IT IS?😂😂😂 @Lyl Bali you're spot-on @Trucker Yah we heard you. Do you need to repeat it. 
1:18:13,1:18:59, some people need to enlarge their Peins in this platform @Dylan Burden ITS NECESSARY IT GOT YOU ATTENTION DIDN'T IT? @Trucker you think Jonas is lying? It still early and Jonas is sweating Ah NKOSINI The Guptas and Zuma must come show their faces...they hide behind lawyers "@Joel Mzayidume YES @Trucker Your bias towards Duduzane is very suspicious. @Magda Seguin yes

I recommend you all block Trucker Wow @Trucker that is strong BLOCK ME FOR WHAT NOW? 😂😂 It is nice to write stories from far away Trucker sits in one of ANC war rooms. These guys are getting paid by ANC to protect corruption and skew narratives. 
1:20:17,1:21:15, @Musa Bakiti anybody can be racist. being black does not make you immune. You cannot paint an entire race with one brush. In South Africa we are all individuals. Peace and love. Are we going to see these people appearing at the commission Lol Mcebisi Jonas was so afraid of the Guptas death threats that he didn't tell Thuli Madonsela! What a joker😂😂 Trucker u sometimes out of line. The plot to use this platform to tarnish ANC and not individuals involved with the hope of gaining votes will be defeated. So why is Mr Jonas answering questions from the Guptas who have refused to appear "Guys 8 may vote EFF 4 clean government😊😉 @Thulani Bukani Shame man when people can't debate they start creating conspiracy theories about war rooms.

"JONAS goes to the PP to pen a report on STATE CAPTURE & talk EXTENSIVELY about it "AGRIZZI TALKED ABOUT ""MONOPOLY MONEY""🙄🙄🙄" The fact that Mr Mcebisi Jonas doesn't know which Gupta bribed him is cause for concern.The case will be easily thrown out in a court of law. @Thando Nkutha me too.

Jonas always travel alone! this advocate 😃 Lawyers always do this.

2:20:10,2:21:06, Weak lawyer Mr Jonas is firm on hs answers I like how he handles this Gupta paid lawyer. No its about the affirmative actiosn. hahahahaha How can Jonas not know the President by then? Jonas has better English than the lawyer. Jonas was baby sitting his boss's son Rude aggressive lawyer "this Advocate is making inroads 
2:21:13,2:22:16, Jonas was taught how to deal with interrogation Bosasa money comes to Zuma lawyer. what inroads?!!! All about Jonas lawyer statement...sabotage much?? Is the lawyer of Jonas not allowed to interdict this lawyer? Different from the statement? OK. "@Dumile Mateza Really This lawyer is payed by Guptas This Lawyer must stop pointing finger. Using his finger is a sign of disrespect. 
2:22:18,2:23:13, All Commissions in South Africa were just a white wash and there is no difference with Zondo Commission which is eating time so that we can reach the elections without noticing the rot of the ANC. He never signed the statement @Magda Seguin LOL Yesterday we experienced how bad it is to sign blindly Poor Mr Jonas is painting himself in a corner.. He's going to hang himself @Benny Bala no prime can walk around withoyt bodyguards This lawyer is going back to the initial question now because he sees he’s losing. Reminds me of my gf. Let this Adv try Juluis Malema!!!! He will regret Eishhh now you see Zuma lawyer eating sadsa 
2:23:13,2:24:14, HE NEVER SIGNED THEREFORE NOTHING LINK HIM TO THE STATEMENT! stupid ADV 😞 no he wont -hes strong the noose is tightening hahaha No advocate Fana Hlonganwe "So Thuli Madonsela's state capture report was based on factually incorrect statements. First Vytjie Are politicians scared of the people? Some even have 8 bodyguards @Luxolo Nogobela Yes there is such a practice in peaceful countries. Trucker indeed a big ruse to get Msholozi out @Thulani ...lol 
2:24:20,2:25:12, This adv is busy with statement that was not written by Jonas but read to Him Jonas is looking more true now. sipho mkhize what is the meaning of one settle one bullet I just want to hear the version of his client except small contradictions which does not exclude meeting of Duduzani and Jonas Hehhehe......Zupta Squad...... @Cassius Mngomezulu IT WAS WRITTEN IN MCEBISI'S NAME AND HE SAW IT!! No adv Fana Jonas is guilty Hey banna wmc is representing the man who is against wmc 
2:25:17,2:26:19, This is another issue that should be attended to in cutting down costs by the government.sometimes these people are our friends but as soon as they become ministers all of a sudden need potection There is a saying: 'when you speak the truth you don't have to remember lies' Exactly Magda. I believe him "Don't fall for false hope of new dawn  No Jonas is clear. Fana is the banker. True @Tekani Mabasa. Jonas is so Kool. Nothing to worry about. His body language says 'You are boring'. "This cross questioning is flawed Jonas don't trust the police 
2:26:30,2:27:26, Thatha Jonas SABC is starting to sabotaging us now. I don't trust the police any way. LOL JONAS IS NOW BRINGING UP INTELLIGENCE REPORTS COMPILED BY APARTHEID SPIES! "Jonas be careful True ANC WILL never change Jonas trust sangoma not the police. @Serepa Le Mabona SO YOU KNOW BETTER THAN JUDGE ZONDO? This lawyer though 😂😂😂 
2:27:27,2:28:19, They are cowards hahahahahahahaaa this Advovo 😃 They dont have ball this lawyer is heavenly sent😎😎 In context he is saying that he didnt trust the NPA and Hawks to report the death threats sipho what is the meaning of settle one bullet This lawyer chowed ZUPTA money. Trying to shine. Branches of ANC still led by the same ppl heaven sent? dream on 
2:28:28,2:29:18, "the attorney/legal rep is helping the commission to dig more Oh no wher eis yr friends statement THTS WHY WE SOULD NOT VOTE FOR THIEVES Branches my Foot-this thing is killing the ANC LOL!! Only trying to discredit Jonas. Nothing about his serious alegations. Only frivolous issues. mbalula na Jonas is Pravin's lapdog lawyer i meant.. 
2:29:23,2:30:28, Jonas is true. They try to mess him. Viva the old style ANC. Not the Zuma ANC. "@Luxolo ""heavenly sent"" by who for what" LAWYER HAS NO CASE. how is he suppose to know where leaks come from??? there's also intelligence here! All of it...new and old Jonas is being EXPOSED FOR HIS LIES "This Advocate is totally within his rights to ask questions Guptas leaked everything to the press wow 
2:30:35,2:31:17, Even Judge Zondo looks bored. This lawyer must just move on @thando what makes u say no case Now ANC HAS TWO PRESIDENTS ZUMA AND RAMAPHOSA Eastern Cape struggle. Messy. "YOU CAN'T LIE FOREVER You can't break Jonas Mbalula is no Zulu and he is clean South Africans are deeply traumatised but also numb with all this Zuma/Gupta 9 wasted years luxolo the guys is a liar 
2:31:21,2:32:11, Why they dig up Mandela name? the lawyer is establishing inconsistencies in probing narratives and facts Jonas’ body language shows his uncomfortable Jonas may be clean in the context of this commission but he is Pravin's lapdog ANC DIED WITH MANDELA Jonas was feeding us with gossip I agree Simphiwe @Thando Nkutha. Why is he block so i can also follow. I dont like ppl who are racist. Can you tell why is he / she block? "Take it slowly Jonas 
2:32:13,2:33:14, This bozo of a lawyer is better suited to be a character in a Mickey Spillane mystery story. Duduzane's legal team shouldn't have opted to cross-examine coz their argument has no basis Jonas is resilient "THULI MADONSELA MUST ALSO COME TO THE STATE CAPTURE who gets comfortable being cross questioned???\ "this lawyer always says ""let move on quickly""still repeat" Chiang Mai Springbok did you meet the famous Marc? I reported Luxolo Nogobela for harassment and hate speech This lawyer is all over the place. He's not enlightening Zondo on anything 
2:33:24,2:34:23, he's clutching at straws 😃 "@thando @Tozamile Funani ...that is too true......don't think it is very nice thing..etc @Luxolo Nogobela True 😂: A person with nothing to worry about @Tozamile @Thando Nkutha. 😂😂😂😂 Tone of lawyer very condescending "Now lawyer says MR Hlonagwane "This lawyer is trying to intimidate Jonas with his gestures 
2:34:29,2:35:05, HEAD OF ARGUMENT- I have difficulty in finding or labeling Jonas a LIAR. Jonas was having contacts with journalists Chair please protect Jonas. How many bundles must we work on? Now is this in few seconds another bundle!! Willie you read it right. His even confusing the Chair "When is Duduzane giving his side As as the HAWKS and the NPA are arresting people this brazeness by the enablers is going to come to an end. They must stop looking at low hanging fruit statement for Jonas is worrying though 
2:35:28,2:36:29, This lawyer has nothing to say. he must just sit down. So Mcebisi Jonas is admitting to sending Thuli Madonsela3 incorrect statements which formed part of her state capture report 🤔🤔. the lawyer is a bad fellow he is not sure about a lot of things Lawyer please sit down I meant to say as soon as they start areesting people But your lawyers statement u must read b4 it is send away @lucky he was lying with the pp and said something else with the commission i agree he looks nerves to me The issue here is Zuma sold South Africa to Indians not afrikaaners 
2:36:32,2:38:21, "Jonas is true. Lawyer getting hungry and angry because Jonas is protected by truth The lawyer is stressed bcos he does not get the answers he want.The most important thing for his case is what happened at the Gupta house and is not giving Duduzane's version. Lol lo tata viva Jonas in his original testimony he said he was contacted by Duduzane but now he says he is the one who contacted Duduzane our jonas knows his story and he does not beat about the Bush @ crispian so true.jonas came forward with a corruption how can it be allowed for lawyers to speculate on lies and make it the truth. this lawyer has no shame he will sell his soal for a quick buck @Thando HOW ? This think of cross X Jonas was granted incorrect. how can you cross X when we dont know you side of story 
2:38:22,2:39:22, I agree with you Pravin is untrustworthy Haibo lawyer @francel true old white school not Wits @Lyl Bali This lawyer is just chowing the ZUPTA money Not sure😂😅 "the lawyer send it b4 he read it This lawyer has failed to discredit Mr Jonas @Thando the positions produced it as his statement and he saw and agreed but ddint sign cos he knew those were lies hence he is not a credible witness because he had an agenda 
2:39:32,2:40:25, Pravin must be brought in to be exposed.Black indian If Pravin cannot be trusted why should Jonas be trusted? They are birds of the same feather. Jonas is bored Kodwa what is this lawyers' version from his client? @Benny Bala he's so relaxed Jonas is true. Haaaaaaaaaa Ayibo by the way Even a small child can see who is a liar here everything it was not my statement but that statement is the one who led to this commission kushukuthi Jonas ubona izinto zokudlala nje la bazomembula 
2:40:27,2:41:30, Jonas is killing this guy PLS call me There are something seriously wrong with some of the people commenting here. If you cannot by now distinguish truth from falsehood you NEVER WILL. Mmmmm......The Zupta's lawyer is paid very well......why wouldn't he take the case etc.... Zupta didn’t check the profile of this lawyer Jonas must be number 2 on the ANC List Jonas you go sir. humiliate this lawyer further please This lawyer has nothing on Jonas. Where is Mr Mkize Viva Jonas you are relaxed this is truth to power 
2:41:34,2:42:44, "Where did the lawyer get this statement from Not hJonas's number- What do you think of the lawyer's research? Credibilty is questionable here. This lawyer is indifferrent about this case. do it Mr Jones mo kene Zuma lawyer getting very angry. Did the vehicle have 4 wheels ? How do you know? He even left his VISA card behind. OK very very what exactly? Viva Jonas Viva...Jonas for Deputy President a fabricated statement becomes this lawyers proof? Stupid lawyer I like when the lawyer said let's leave that he was driven by the people who threatened to kill him to the airport Tip toe 
2:43:08,2:44:03, Jonas for Pollmoor. 🙃 Duduzane Zuma must take a stand as well Jonas fed us with lies This lawyer is getting more stupid each minute. So Desperate. "@Thando Nkutha Exactly "Who is this lawyer representing Duduzane Mr Mkize where are you? Waste of time. he feeds us with true nothing the true 
2:44:04,2:45:04, Don't recall Mr Jonas he represent Duduzane ncncncncncnc muncu le lawyer... hay suka lets tip toe on? Jonas is Frank and straight forward @Julius Me lius more stupid by minute 😃 The lawyer thusfar has already done his job by pointing out all contradictions and lies. So this statement that was send to Thuli by the lawyer was just rubbish "Mcebisi Jonas and Vitjie Mentor 
2:45:08,2:46:05, yes If you denied anything written by your lawyer who's stupid here? the answer is obvious if you pass grade 1 It looks the lawyer who wrote the unsigned statement worked with the NPA exavt @rakeep the whole bunch do not understand..or they are journalists trying to further a common narrative @Niematullah Rakeep The lawyer's affidavit is incorrect. Truth and lies is like water and oil. Bewarned Duduzani Lawyer proofs nothing so far @Indoda Yamaqiniso Jonas' credibility has not even been scratched. What's your point 
2:46:36,2:47:27, "@imdoda exactly @Indoda yamaqiniso do those who are accused and put this country's economy in danger csn they remember the mess they caused. how come u don't check your statement This is a looooong half hour This commission was implemented based on lies. @Buhle Ntombela You don't accuse people with incorrect facts. Made up facts. this lawyer is wasting our time he's confused I was thinking the same if hear the name ntlemeza eish he was stupid police boss 
2:47:28,2:48:11, Ntlbemeza Yokoh Are they going to cross examine duduzane Why did Jonas not be careful with the wording of statement? Seems it was trapped by purpose. hahahahahhaaa shame this Advovo needs to away this lawyer's affidavit! Did they put this country at danger or they tempered with white monopolies?😂😅 "@indoda absolutely loo @Indoda yamaqiniso I am so happy that you are a lone voice in the wilderness defending the indefensible "Poker players 
2:48:21,2:49:38, "@thando The lawyer seems desperate he is\ What's happened in when you live Eastern Cape and who brought you back to government I like it Nhlmeza is synonymous with lies Police also cooked up data by themselves to support the higer office how can he have a memory of a document addressed to Speaker?!!! this guy is not testing jonas regarding the bribes WHO IS GOING TO JAIL? 
2:49:48,2:50:54, "Mcebisi Jonas the adv "Hang on strongly Mr Jonas "IN LAW- It's what you can prove "I would rather be a clever balck than even though black do not own the economy Becasue Jonas did not want the big problems he knew it would be very difficult. Writing to the Speaker to implicate Jonas...eish the ZumaGuptas will stop at nothing This lawyer must put his client's version.He should not have taken this case as it makes him look like a fool. just hate people who keep on asking same question 100 times and given the answer and still ask it again and again... lawyers 
2:51:08,2:53:00, Very smart not trusting so many state organisations. This Jonas is true. I am waiting for the question about the 600 000 ... @Khaya Ngcatshe YES H e has not put a single issue said either by Duduzane or Hlongwane. Who is he representing exactly himself This Jonas is true the lawyer is desperate for emali How do we expect Jonas to trust Nhlemeza. 🙄🙄🙄 Now lawyer is being racist. 
2:53:07,2:54:42, How can a police make statement on your behalf if I am not brief about it? About the bribe Jonas said it himself his not sure who was in the house and he decided to leave his body guards to go to the place he don't know I'm a judge but I can see who is Jonas Dont leave anything aside Mr Jonas "WMC is bad for Zumas Tell them Political appointees at the NPA and Hawks warning against Cope and DA? Look @ Maleka Look at Mokwena how he look at the Adv thats Pravin doesnt want to be cross examined 
2:54:47,2:55:44, "@Buhle Ntombela Be as it may 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 Why should he know? Jonas is much smarter than this Zuma lawyer. "The lawyer must be charged Lawyer failed dismally........shame @Buhle Ntombela you argument is flawed both in law and fact when you still you are charged in relation to who was in the room with you or who saw you. Not state money.... he's clients moola I'm just impressed by Mr Jonas... very streight forward and attitulate... lawyers just keeps on dwindling on one place Nice Mr Jonas this lawyer is a criminal lawyer and i can be a criminal too. 
2:55:48,2:57:03, Why has Mcebisi Jonas been quiet about the fact that the statement sent by his lawyers to the commission was incorrect? Criminals discusing Guptas adv This lawyer has ran out of idea and questions "If ZUPTAS bribed Jonas @Lyl Bali the feeding us with gossip Duduzane must claim refund from this lawyer "Jonas is an unreliable witness Hambaaaaa adv 
2:57:06,2:58:27, Waste of everyone's time "Ayi wena  @Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi i beg to differ sir Some people don't listen and internalize...The statement was NOT signed by Jonas Mcebisi Jonas wins 5-0 Did he sign the statement? IF not then it isn't his statement is it? Jeez the lawyer is giving up? His lawyer at tbe time who tried to discredit him Mcebisi Jonas stood his ground and frustrated this lawyer in the process.🤣🤣 
2:58:28,2:58:58, "some 1 saw the holes on the 1st statement  Haaaisuka "you'll have to be beyond gullible or blind not to see that Jonas was lying through his teeth @Magda Seguin And the AFFIDAVIT has got hole it. But all his answer is proving Jonas otherwise frankly I use to think Jonas is a smart man but let's wait and see because the investigation will follow maybe his right who knows Here is an advocate Wim Trengove "Anyone can write something on your behalf Why are people not prosecuted instead of wasting our money in useless end Jonas is a pathological liar 
2:59:07,3:00:34, Jonas referred to his affadavit before the commission ALL the time to debunk the false statement lies have short legs indeed Who is this? I supposed is Jona Lawyer Jonas will be grilled for free You've done well Mcebisi. he fed us gossip Did he trust his NEC comrades in the ANC @Benny it appears that we are not talking about the same commission..which one are you listening to "Jonas doesn't have the luxury to chose which statements that should be accepted 
3:00:37,3:02:08, Who does Trengrove represent? zuma This commision must close cause Jonas is denying the stament to public protector "He went there unknowingly but accepted no BRIBES Any person thinking that Jonas is truthful must have his or her head read. Yes Adv Trengrove. Your learned friend didn't even touch on what the meeting was about. Very telling. @Niematullah Rakeep spot on It's not his statement but the statement is the one which was used by public protector which Public Protector lied to the Nation "Jonas had ONE affidavit 
3:02:18,3:04:09, "He is a pathetic witness What a stupid version that would require a meeting about rumours. "Zuma lawyer did not touch about the issue of what was discussed to say Jonas is lying @Skhumbuzo Mgobhozi he thought cross examination is like some gossip on the street "Magda @ Magda Seguin Personal phone/cell numbers are incorrect. That's what I reffered to. Black Guys represented by Abelungu- Tom Moyane is keeping it Black "Malema told Zuma face to face about this Guptas in Rusty Politics of the Stomach 
3:04:21,3:06:29, Why was Agrizzi arrested after the Commission but others implicated not arrested. This Commission stinks. Now is the time to grill Jonas before even grilling Duduzane. Mxm kudlalwana ngathi apha. "In his statement to the Public Protector Why doesn't Gordhan want to be cross examined? "10 minutes is up Arrogant mother f88888 We are here because of Jonas statement but now he denied everything kanti lomhlaba unjani noPastor uphikile ukuthi uthe uvuse umuntu kwabafile "But I'm not shocked at all by this And Fakey This guy is representing Jonas 
3:06:33,3:09:01, "I m shocked he didn't trust even the police minister Zuma can lie sowaar Vytjie another lair Does anyone believe the Guptas?? what a joke Two ministers Ramatlodi and Jonas called by Duduzane to meet him who and on which capacity did he do that? ND DOES ANY ONE BLEAVE MALEMS WHAT A JOKR If all these Statements are untrue whyvarevwe wasting data? why pay this commission? Who believe the Guptas today except for BLF and Zuma faction within the ANC??? Cyber documents can be accessed forever...Duduzanes is playing with fire 
3:09:17,3:11:14, Jonas at great cost to his career told the truth . Nit picking over minor details does not take away this mans truth. Hang in there Jonas "There are parts of the evidence of Mr Jonas that do come across a bit flaky This Kant is smiling "There was no meeting with the Gupta family Nah was picking his teeth lol Real Lawyers still exist... the Tengteng Thanks Judge...we need forensic evidence That is what an advocate does when he cross examines this guy just destroyed Ntlemeza in seconds! :)\ 
3:11:14,3:14:16, What we must find is why there was a meeting at saxonwold.details of the meeting Trengrove just walked over Nhlemeza Thuli Madonsela must be called Son of president got no authority to do that Bali and at no point did he discuss business with this ministers but they made unstatemanship move by agreeing to meet him. "Jonas himself agreed with the Gupta family that there was no meeting with the family Fakey Mental is Narcassistic Duduzane was the president of anc not his father Lyl I agree with you bcos in most instances it is Duduzane who arranges for these meetings.The same happened with Mr Ramatlodi. This guptas want to confuse us and the witnesses 
3:14:34,3:17:07, "according to Jonas There is is! Adv Trengrove has now corrected the false perceptions? Not only the NPA and Hawks that are captured but this Public Protector too Who's lawyers are not here today guys? Here is no about believing Zuma or not but its about to get the truth thats why you have to wait until child's birth before you give the name for now we are just commenting about what we see not media This thing of leaders and their kids dining in government affairs it's annoying 😣 Hlongwane absconded from coming to cross exmine Jonas shame Fana Hlongwana's lawyers mis omw Jonas excelled under cross-examination
