1:53:06,1:55:32, @Keith We do not have enough testing station so there's no way of really determining how many people have actually already been in contact with the virus without even knowing. And wash your hands @Keith There could be people who are currently infected by the virus but do not know. It's about R1400 cash just to get screened. how many people do not have access to that kind of money as is.
