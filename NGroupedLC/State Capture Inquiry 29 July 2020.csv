38:12,44:51, @Abel because he does not want to answer any questions in case he puts his foot in it. he is a pig at the public trough. No the kraal at Nkandla The Chair Zondo protecting Mr. Ntlheko's not acceptable that is the duty of his lawyer. he seems to not like saying a simple yes @Bev Daniels kkkkkkkk Zuma stole few millions in two terms. 50 BILLIONS is gone before Cyril finishes his first term 😁😁😁😁😁😁😂😂😂😂😂😂😁😁😂😂 "@Mbuso Who in ANC does not steal? @Bev Daniels then let's allow Malema to lead us 
46:28,49:43, the name ANC only does not steal @Dominic Przybylski I think there is no one in this world who have clean hands @Mbuso Ndlovu I don't trust Gucci Revolutionaries. Chair is getting paid by an hour the more this nonsense last the bigger his pocket😁😂😁😂 may be hellen zille or patricia de lille would be right to lead this country morning everyone seems like everyones jus postponing Why can't we lead ourselves. Do adults really need someone else to tell them what to do? "would we ever see anyone getting charged and arrested from this Wow Hellen Ziĺle to lead the country....thats a joke 
49:48,53:47, ek hou net om na die saak te luister en hou hoe die chair alles hanteer I don't like Zille but she did rescue Cape Town. @Thobela Wem This commission is a waist of CASH ofcourse she would rescue CT im not surprised CT was fast slipping into ANC scenario of corruption and mismanagement before she took control. Helen Zille for President "I am listening does not mean a “yes” - please answer the question "@Mbuso Ndlovu Out with the ANC CANCER 
54:56,57:59, @Val Speirs We need someone like Trumph "I hope Covid - 19 takes out the ANC  The country would be a proper Animal Farm.....her twèets are a depiction of that. I am patriot of Trumps. At least he puts people first and creates jobs . The ANC must know they are on the way out of power ... looting is in full gear .. closing down sale Nami ake ningibize nizongibuza zonke lezinganekwane enibuzana Zona lapho ANC are on their way out just wait till the Virus gets them. People confuse being politically correct with being an effective leader. A politically correct person doesn't have the guts to be unpopular so cannot be a real leader. "Oh the antic of this witness 
58:21,1:00:38, Then who is in if they are on their way out? I wont mind a Trump here as President he wont accept any theft and or corruption create employment. "Chair It’s cold They have not paid the heating account. Only when you are in the HOT SEAT This small talk is such a waste of time. @Peet Venter -agree only hard when he want to hurry up the Evidence lead. anyone would be better 
1:01:06,1:08:31, Oh he attended yesterday ... why didn't he prepare for today... always excuses... he want to stop ..the questions...LOL... Infrastructure old what do you expect . Don’t act stupid everything is screwed up in this freaking country Why waste electricity when it's very easy to wear a jersey at no cost. If one minister or two can go to jail I think it will make a difference Simpler English don’t act dumb Yes i agree.. all criminals should/must be prosecuted @jones noah Banda.. Cough cough cough too academic for simple questions I am going for a walk I had enough of this nonsense. 
1:09:14,1:10:21, smoke break Pee break Hahahaha Oops the volume... oh... i was about to smash my router sound? and nou?? Former minister Nhleko is using delay tactics to stall the questioning in an effort to have more time to think about his answers. mute🤷🏾‍♂️ 
1:10:47,1:19:48, What’s going on guys tea break Corruption consumes wealth without replacing it. Ultimate effect of corruption is destitution. Those with wealth will leave. Those without it will starve to death. volume is not there did mr. fire pool ask for tea break again please when resume let there be sound Ok tea-break..well that make sense... I hope the witness don't start complaining of stomach pains.. next....:elbowcough: Zondo mmmmm mmmmm mmmmm sounds like a Hippo "Commissions are different from court rooms in that the Chair 
1:21:54,1:35:26, Commission inquisitions are the most tedious and boring things. This is not a courtroom!!! like he crush one helicopte with 9 people death last year in usa sport black ( sorry for my call black becsuse i did not remember his name ) men death in helicopte @Askar Niko02 Eh? is this hoke Gona give Alli a chance to question him hello my fellow laggers There're are protocols that must be followed..... Are we busy with a lecture again? This Bra knows exactly what he is doing by avoiding to answer questions Morning All 
1:36:00,1:39:16, "@Alex "He says there are rules and regulations in government Are we still on about the 2 reports 🙆 But he received the later report before the fist report. Gerda 7 Welcome to commission inquiries. That's what they often do because they trying to establish clarity around an issue. "Morning Ishaad A witness definition of a report... really this is babble... He is leading the commission of enquiry. this guy should be a headmaster 
1:39:37,1:43:28, DCJ seems to continually interrupt Hulley's line of questioning while allowing the witness to wax long on all kinds of sideroads. @David Tuer Agreed. Mr Nhleko holds a Diploma in labour law from the Graduate Institute of Management and Technology. I think the only way you can ever get a straight answer from this guy.. is by water-boarding...😆😆 m . This is not the same Bra who told South Africans that Nkandla needed more money to finish the work???? Zondo is trying to get Nhleko to admit that he possesses at least a small vestige of common sense. and a bit of integrity... 
1:43:38,1:47:39, "Exactly Mr. Chair Actually cannot have much common sense if he considered a fancy swimming pool to be a security feature. stupidity is also obviously an answer Dominic- he's not trying very hard. I can’t even🙄🙄 Mr. Nhleko is giggling because he realizes he's painted himself into a corner. "Yes Trying to look clever Trying to justify why he chose the report that suited his perspective. Surely faced with the conflicting findings as well as the timing from March to Dec he should have delved deeper. 
1:47:46,1:50:28, uyaxoka Nhleko. He also assumed that the first report could be the correct one because it serves his agenda. "To obtain ""absolute clarity"" surely the first step is to ask the people who produced the report to clarify??" Ha ha talking himself into a corner. He keeps explaining the processes but clearly didn't follow them as he so elegantly states... i thought these arrogant firepool minister is has finished his testimony yeasterday "Mr. Nhleko is speaking in abstract terms about ""possibilities"" that could arise in organizational structures. He's not clarifying the position he took when presented with the 2 reports. He's delaying" mentally bankrupt trough feeder never trust a overweight politician the man said he is even beter then laywers but just listen how he corner himself ask no questions and tell no lies.........here comes the cough........so we will need to take a 3 week break so he can consult with his master JZ Sounds like a Grade7 school debate. 
1:50:32,1:53:21, Ivan Vries👍 Mr. Nhleko STOP TALKING!!!!!!!!! New application of Stalingrad tactics. He'll just carry on talking until he dies of old age. This guy such a bs They are both excruciatingly boring If this guy was my subordinate I would have charged him with dereliction of duty. He took a decision without considered all the facts at his disposal. Cough cough and Come on Zondo. Control you witness. Don't let him control you. This is the 3rd point that hes trying to explain for half an hour .He cannot answer one question straight!! 
1:53:26,1:57:43, Nhleko is obfuscating "@dominic 😘😘 😍😍😍 😘😘😘 I find it very concerning that they can be laughing about this. Seriously This is just a waste of time and money "he thinks he is a practitioner of governance! Holy man of governance I'm amazed Hulley can remember where he was before the debate over nothing started. 
1:58:25,2:01:56, Davd Tuer 🤣😂 He is still not answering the question. @Michelle Wright I would guess they wanted to channel him into his illusional world of lame sarcasm. You would have seen Nhleko's stinking attitudinal approach I wonder what was this guys salary per month and all the perks ? How can he have had the necessary competence to fill that post. The answer is obviously NO. It's obvious it was substantial...he is very well fed. "@Michelle Wright I guess he does not want to give him grounds to say the process is /was unfair to him I think so @Guglethu Xhosans there is a HUGE difference between an SOP and a LAW......... 
2:02:08,2:04:51, @Margaret Waterboer...THANK YOU!!!!:dothefive: "I thought this Witness was meant to take a short period of time but he is playing games with the Commission. Time for Zondo and Counsel to take control and put questions that requires "" Yes"" or ""No""." Exactly ... this action is known as gross misconduct and is a criminal offence.... now stop using these hypothetical scenarios .... to hide your incompetence..it's pathetic... @Margareth Waterboer .....Trump learned his tricks from our government....we are world leaders in corruption if you are not educated and have experience you will see policies only as guidelines to suit your agenda! If this goes to trial he will be lambasted ... Trump for president Rubbish . Trump is no COMPARISON to ANC. You watch too much of the Corrupt News Network ..CNN Also that's when my cat gave birth to 6 kittens... and the my Koi-fish arrived... really..... 
2:04:57,2:07:43, If Trump was our President our economy would be booming. Where does Trump figure here? Try to focus.! "@Val Speirs a ""Yes"" or ""No"" answer is not in the terms of reference for this commission inquiry. This is not a court room madam." South African Voters got what they deserved...this clown "True voters do not realize what they are voting for Bruce. Yes as did the USA.🤣🤣🤣🤣 lets focus on state capture inquiry stop indulging this slippery clown "@val speirs 
2:07:51,2:10:26, @Kevin I agree with our situation. Trump was corrupt before he became leader. Agree @Val Speirs "lets rather focus on what led Nhleko to be on that chat of state inquiry "Trump will win again @Margareth Waterboer .... Well to be honest 90% of all world leaders are corrupt. Its just that they have the brains to cover it up and not be so greedy. State capture inquiry...Anyone ever found guilty? Anyone ever been arrested? or just a waste of money. IS JUST A WASTE OF MONEY No one was ever found guilty The CNN fake news try promote the Democrate Agenda so many networks in US doing the same. 
2:10:27,2:11:41, "I see you support the USA democrats phew "In fact Val. 63 million is less than 65 million. So no silent majority @Val Speirs You may be right. The politically correct brigade have become so aggressive and intimidating that many probably lie in opinion polls. STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 
2:11:45,2:14:12, STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 STATE CAPTURE INQUIRY is one of a talk show we have been viewing since 1994 Isaiah--What are you doing? Thanks to Zuma How did he ever become a Minister in the first place it all sounds very fire-poolish like reminds me of that day in parly... I feel sorry for Hulley. Zondo has turned him into a spectator. 
2:14:22,2:16:02, he says to Zondo Look look look look This man is speaking gibberish. this guy is wasting our time... this will take years and tax payers money........ agreeing with the Chair is disrespectful and should not be entertained @Roy Kisten lol at look Dominic- seems to me that there is some problem between Zondo and Hulley. "Sorry This guy is enjoying the attention !! 
2:16:15,2:18:44, @Dominic Przbylski . I guess Zondo could see Nhleko has a stinking attitude towards him just to frustrate him. Zondo is encouraging Nhleko in his time wasting. Why? he hasnt answered anything.. this idiocy! why is zondo allowing this stream of lies and drivel from the witness? This Commission of Enquiry is all Smoke and Mirrows setup by the ANC to make people think they are actually doing something about their corruption. "I am so worried about the answers given by Minister Nhleko and too much of examples he's giving "N Imagine if JZ and this dude sit down at a table with a few bottles of wine....eish 😂 Only commission of inquiry which achieved an outcome was the Nugent commission. 
2:19:11,2:21:38, Nugent didn't allow time-wasting. adv Mokhari interject quit often!!!!! "@Val Spiers DPC Zondo ' Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Zondo you have been wasting time and waffling. You are responsible. I have had many cups of coffee and I am very alert . Nathi Nhleko is smart at deflection and expending times allocated. "@Val @Dominic Przybylski yes while he is very smart though 
2:21:48,2:24:12, Pops... dont be a dork "Val-- Listening to this load of tripe Absolutely the sarcasm of lawyers! 1.5 hours if we don't need to listen to Nhlekos duck and dive Hour and a half if the chairperson doesn't intentionally waste time. "@Val Spiers 2 hours due to delaying tactics of Nhleko or even more than that Another day will be enough for them. 
2:24:21,2:26:27, Zondo has been delaying with Nhleko. Sibusio-- It was supposed to finish before lunch yesterday. DJC Zondo keeps on having those rooaaaaaarr moments like a lion he is lol hahahahhaha love him so polite Must move on to the next Witness this one is not cooperative . Witness telling the Commission what to do This witness is now deciding how long the commission must sit!!!! I am now suspicious of Zondo. I don't understand why he has been and still is wasting so much time. Shut up and move on with it!! @Val Speirs lol he is used to dedicator-ship 
2:26:49,2:30:37, Yes "he thinks that he can command anywhere LAW & ORDER "This man is addicted to tea-breaks The witness gave long distracting scenarios deliberately... avoiding answering the questions... No lunch break and go on till 6pm... that will be enough time for them. The calm that is Harley.... @Dominic Przybylski . Hayi suka you have a vendetta against Zondo. This is not a court of law nor criminal matter for that matter. @Gugulethu Xhosans I don't like it when people waste time. 
2:30:53,2:37:00, Answer the bloody question!! unyanisile Gugu Dominic👍 "how was even the""minister""been appointed to head sich ministry if he can't even understand the functions of saps components!!!! political appointees sometimes are problematic" THANK YOU MR NHLEKO! Finally answering a question. That is the point. Crime intelligence cannot investigate itself because it's wrong! Hubert..that is why I say it is all Smoke and Mirrors. @Dominic of cause time will be wasted because this not a court of law. Understanding that to make excuses that they are sick for example would not put them in jail. Therefore Zondo wants to be fair . Fair is not the right word. Try complicit. Moving at a snails pace as per usual 
2:37:17,2:47:12, @Gugulethu Xhosans I have been a fan of Zondo for a while but this is taking far too long at huge expense. We need to see results. Two years and not a single interim report allowing corrective action. It is this dudes opportunity to clear the allegations made against him...he has not done that so give him more rope. This is what JZ is allowing him to do without actually saying it. This is a commission of inquiry not a court or kangaroo court. "Dominic--I too have been impressed by Zondo "can this FOOL just say yes or no At the end Zondo might recommend criminally to be charge implicated persons and negligent individuals. This is excruciating. Ponderous and clumsy. Where is Kate? How do you make the biggest financial scandal in the history of South Africa so boring? Not that anythig is going to come out of this apart from another 7% pay increase for ANC members 
2:47:40,2:53:28, this guy got Zondo commission under his finger tips Mr firepool. He can spin any crap to deflect. indeed @Godfrey. in fact PROCLAMATION NO. R. 24 OF 2020 allows the the HAWKS & NPA to immediately commence with investigations and prosecutions but why is Zondo giving this guy so much leeway """I'm also on the one had... blah de blah..."" ""and yesterday I have made an allegation you have stolen a goat.."" Come on Zondo control your witness." Yes ... Judge slowly lead him into the pit..... clearly he was crap at his job.... Ah who's now asking the questions...?????? about time Zondo Geeeeez....this Nathi fella is really running the show hey.... 
2:53:47,2:56:13, He want to divert by saying its a cultural issue! I think Zondo is waiting for him at the end So he must just yes I was instructing him.... This guy thinks he is untouchable cracking jokes aswell It becomes uncomfortable when you have to lie. The CJ is entertaining Nathi fella way too much......geeeez Agree Arian Soory to say....but the CJ must catch a wake up...... 
2:58:05,2:59:51, I think judge Nugent would have sorted out this fellow jeer!!! DCJ asks a question and then gives the answer too!!! this guy should apply for a headmaster job "He is manipulating them! every time things seem to get tense David Tuer- hehehe ROY--Which one? Zondo is allowing this Bra to run the show....very frustrating...... this police commissioner "In essence he doesn’t want to answer this question 
2:59:52,3:03:40, @Thozamile Yapi - The chair allowing the diversion! "His verbal diareha is worse that Covid 19 The untouchable police minister it seems...... JZ is actually being sneaky..he asks him same questions but in another way and also answers his question. Then the idiot disagrees and spins another story...He is contradicting himself poor fool. Is this a Commission of Enquiry or a comfortable fire-side chat? @Kevin ...Geeez...true...but very frustrating etc... Judge Nugent should have conducted this interview @MIKE DURBAN ....its part of the plan Mike..he is being set up and given rope. It is tedious but necessary. i cant seem to get the story line behind this gentlemen here 
3:03:55,3:07:41, @Kevin .....Man....as long as all this goes to the law courts etc etc....... @holeng masemola .... nor does the witness know the story line....it changes 😂 "I also like judge Nugent old dispensation and Zondo new order he just can't follow procedures..... even now... he's panicking guys.... "what was planned for one day delaying tactics "@Hilton Your comments are making me lough yoh😂😂😂 and seriously are this endless examples necessary though 
3:08:10,3:11:05, "even now i don't know who he is fooling with these responses 😀😀😀 uh oh.....😳 "OH DEAR is that his first or second affadvit?????? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Mr fire pool forgot that he just confirmed that the signature is his i like this evidence leader do they even read these comments 
3:11:35,3:16:19, He is caught out😂🤣 his earlier statements under oath will deal with him😅😅😅 😀😀😀 "the evedince leader is calm and focused @Abel Matshidiso he is very stern and professional in his approach @Ab Yes he is nervous that is why he tries to joke out of it - drowning Did this minister read his own affidavit before he signed it? guilty as sin 
3:16:50,3:18:21, If he is not GUILTY then I am!!! pure contradictions through out.... now stop the babbling ... oh he's now a language expert.... Advocate Hulley is he the Son of KZN Senior Advocate very cool? "This reminds me of a quote ""The person who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client.""" lol... @Dominic Przybylski just love that well said Exactly..:@ Dominic Przybylski ../ 😂😂 Definition of Offence: a breach of law or rule; or illegal act...... 
3:18:36,3:22:28, "@Hilton Walbrugh i think to add to your question one should ask how many of the documents did He familiarize himself with ...hook line and sinker coming up! Am confident BUST!!!!!! Until now!!awa mani. he was to appear for a day only🙉 I don't think he need worry that he will at some time work for the commission.!! 🙄😂😂 This guy is a story teller Mrs Hofmeyer!!!!pls!!!! this guy has been trying to dictate how questions are put to him the whole time 
3:22:35,3:25:30, "@Peter He is attacking Hulley because he is being cornered in a serious way "Mr Hulley is one of those hardworking guys where you just look at him "Hurley is nailing him @Bev Daniels- agree is this a workshop? Little jack horner is now in the corner "@Singi Mathebula - Yes Hurley or Hulley. Big difference. One should be jailed 
3:25:47,3:27:07, "@singi If you have to investigate without assuming guilt then how do you choose who to investigate? Do you investigate everybody? "In my opinion give him a lollipop "He had just said he did not ""instruct"" but ""requested"" but his affidavit says instructed" he is the worst facilitator ever. Mr Public service experrt why did you then not state explicitly precautionary suspension when suspending these people hulley is doing perfectly fine in his stance hallelujah 30min break
