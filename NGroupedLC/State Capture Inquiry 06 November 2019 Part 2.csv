22:07,23:17, @Pastor J I think Manyi is an attention seeker Jimmy Manyi seems to think he’s smarter that everyone unfortunately Gone is the plan he caught fast but he lying his way out "@Yolo More I understand you perfectly. I referring to Manyi he's talking in circles Has he been sworn in? yes Jimmy is running hard. This is a lynchpin for him. Let's understand why it was rescinded! l 
23:18,24:18, Wait for the questions Jimmy marn. he won't survive He is lying right under oath "@ funicanz ​Has he been sworn in? Yes inkukhu inqunywe umlomo wanya manyi "Lex Luger He knows his affidavit backwards. Hayibo!!! "@Phillip Cwazibe  
24:31,25:59, "He is shaking "@Yolo More I agree @lex he thinks he is clever than everyone @James Godloza Godloza Thats what's irritating about him. He is here to remind us he still exists what does this thing think it is @ funicanz he now realizes that he lied in the first hearing. she's gonna finish him off Jimmy is running scared. That's all. He's a full time crook and liar... 
26:09,26:49, Why let him waste our time? He sounds both defensive and desperate. @Thando Nkutha hahahahahaha why are we at a different place now? what happened? @Thando Nkutha I wont advise you to do that. He is a viper with 21 heads Mr Manyi "Thando Nkutha Miss Williams provide full response to your accusations @thando lol my thoughts exactly 
27:15,27:54, Mr Manyi should have consulted Counsel "Ohhh please Jimmy He wants to be crucified fairly. smh prepare your lies more like it he want to hide but there is no way out Hofmeyr must start mr chair. @Khathutshelo Matlou hahahaha "@Thando Nkutha  he had just implied that the commission is unfair to him 
27:54,29:14, He has a point but he is not putting it in a chronology and substantially.......... eish @ Pheladi Lamola ​ It is hot. He has no place to hide the rest must follow "He complained about Advocate Maleka Why did he not just send a sick note or kill himself Let us continue you tell him Zondo...big cry baby All these guys must go and wear orange 
29:17,32:42, "Thanks Chair. @Thando Nkutha  Ask him questions. He can come back for the ones he can't remember. "I told you "You see chair "The way Manyi is nervous i still say wanya manyi But was it necessary to subpoena Mr Manyi? did he refuse to come on request? o yanya o manyi Mandisi Ntauzana yes he refused. 
33:02,34:22, "Dragged kicking and screaming yes their must all go and wear oranje @mandisi ntauzana I assume a subpoena is only issued if the witness refuses a request. His refusal letter was mentioned. The harshness of the way the commission is treating Mr Manyi smells of selective prosecution The trolls have arrived But we never heard anything from anyone to suggest that Mr Manyi refused to attend except for him arguing that the matter to be dealt with is LRA matter Ms Hofmeyer is not going to adjourn this hearing. It will go through. This time Manyi won't blame the how she's standing. She is present respectfully so let's begin. No chair. 
34:26,35:50, theire stole alot of mula mandisi go away Bengimuthatha kacane losisi Adv. Uyashisa shame. @mandisi ntauzana What have they done wrong? "@mandisi as his opening remarks were ""what am I doing here as I have already testified in this commission"" he thought he had fooled everyone" "Lex Luger look at our military veterans. its a shame what theire going thru. DISGUSTING Wow @Thando Nkutha @Yolo More She is something else 
35:50,36:27, Jimmy probably thought he would get Adv Mokoena and he was ready to treat him the same way he treated Maleka. Kate is warming up now. Why subpoena someone who believe that his presence should not be sought because the matter in dispute is a LRA matter........ commission should have pushed to convince him to provide affidavit this lady is so sharp... @mandisi do you want this country to be rid of corruption? I love you Ms Hofmeyr "Jimmy thought this commission was going to be a walk over. First time he went there on his own accord queen of queens this lady is very sharp 
36:37,37:27, @mandisi ntauzana There is no matter LRA or not that is Subjudice "Tholani Dlomo used excuse of being sick to explain why his employer couldn't find him for 6 months. Zuma also ""too sick"" to attend. Surely Manyi has a tame doctor to give hime a sick note." but let's treat each other fairly "I salute you Adv. You were brought up well Bathathe Advocate Kate! Hahahahahaha Ku lit apha I TAKE MY HAT OFFFF FOR MISS HOFMEYER That's why he is fighting...caught out in his lies Adv Hofmeyr is just someone who really loves our country 
37:35,38:42, is the right one to lead him today. Suddenly I dont miss Maleka anymore 👏👏👏 There's nothing unfair about the way Jimmy is being treated. Encore encore salute adv Hofmeyr!!!! "Jimmy now Jimmy will attack Kate miss Hofmeyr dishonest aiaiaiai manyi uzonya mfana 
38:51,40:27, 😆😆 Yho! Chair you are wasting our time and data with Jimmy. Talk Manyi raise your concerns this is a democratic country u are free Jimmy being Jimmy MR MONEY TAKER Jimmy KNOWS he is in over his head. ATM @Mandisi ntauzana Manyi didn’t want to come to answer questions again so once commission find difficult left with no choice to subpoena him even Zuma we will do the same anyone infect Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy you are the disrespectful one 
40:30,41:39, Wait for the questions. We want answers not discussions. "In Jimmy's own head LIEGBEK LIEG BEK He certainly seems to remember plenty now... Lots of trolls here ...compliments of ATM Blah blah blah blah She She She.....has aname DCJ you are too soft for my liking. "Makhosi did Mr Manyi miss any date to appear or refused to submit any documentation? come on let's be fair people 
41:46,42:39, "We can hear all this when you are led in evidence But we would also like to test Mildred's bone fides. Get on with it. Bring the proof Jimmy MR MONEY "jimmy ""phunyuka"" manyi in the house" MR MONEY @yolo not soft but giving the man the longest rope to hang himself I want to hear Hofmeyr's response to the claim she's dishonest. POLSMOOOOOR 
42:42,43:27, @Frans Phala bamubambile kajeno he's always hostile This Ntauzana must be blocked. Reveal the names amnesia from jimmy is miraculously dissappeared thank my lord Jesus for you are a great healer I am waiting 2 MR MONEY POLSMOOOOR IS CALLING YOU "Lol Yolo Block me bro Yuuu lotata umosha ixhesha Lethu ngoku ufana ukusizelwa Ngoku🥶

"Hahaha but we do need people like mandisi so we are constantly reminded of people who don't care about their country @mandisi ntauzana I wont block you. Your perspective is interesting. I like trying to work out why people defend those who have impoverished our country. Hoffman 
44:50,46:12, @Yolo More ... Maybe I am wrong but @mandisi ntauzana has not done anything wrong. He expessed his views like the rest of us. Speak Jimmy. Keep speaking. Come on Manyi. This not a court of law. we need the truth finish and klaar Time to start......... the commission must not subpoena people just for the sake of subpoena @Dominic Przybylski 😂😂😂😂😂😂 How was the rugby folks didn't I tell you we would win! playing the Victim THE THRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE. MR MONEY YOU IN A CORNER @Born free Tell us about the T20 
46:12,46:57, You did. @Born free ...and the other 57million tooooo Yes DCJ "Lol Dominic you killing me bro TRUTH It's going ahead folks! "Born free @mandisi for what reason should people be subpoenaed Rugby? How much did u get from Saxon world 
47:02,48:25, POLSMOOOOOOR FOR YOU Mr. Manyi doesn't want to be led in evidence 🤣🤣🤣yes the party is at my place "failure to attend or action a legal instruction should be met with subpoena "@Kay Kay  Adv Sikhakhane or Masuku would babe been of assistance here "They must also call the fat guy who cried on TV @mandisi ntauzana You obviously have inside information or disinformation. Which is it? MR MONEY YOU RESPONSIBLE 
48:26,50:37, Anybody else noticing the GUPTA PUPPETS? Molefe Yip "Funicanz @Yolo More . I apologise . I understand better now Correct! @Thando "Lol Dominic awume tu and if no facts exist... then you create them? hahahaha Dominic easy lol 
50:41,52:08, "Let's see DCJ do you think Jimmy is listening to you or he cares? How do you know he did not reject a request from the commission? Please Zondo just rule on his silly objections and get on with this facts don't exist then we don't fall into a predetermined view. ORANGE UNIFORM SAYING TRONKVOEL @mandisi ntauzana That answer only makes sense to a spin-doctor or politician. NOWHERE OUT FOR MR MONEY The Guptas chose the ministers.. corrupt ministers 
52:15,54:19, Which request did he reject because even last Friday when the subpoena was issued there were correspondences........ so we don't have any reason to believe Manyi refused any lawful instruction and you have inside information about the correspondence? The Rain is coming... Jehovah's plans for this committee will ultimately lead to its own end. JAILBIRD ON HIS FACE Does Jimmy think these people are stupid. "we wasted a lot of time because of this subpoena agreed "Dominic Zondo putting words in his mouth.. 
55:13,56:34, @ Mark Waner ​Does He is caught off guard. He thought the truth would come out. YES ADV HOFMEYER WILL SURELY DEAL WIYH THEME Jimmy is staying today! I'm sorry to say this but Zondo does not need to be soft with Manyi bcos we won't move bcoz Jimmy won't allow adv Hofmeyer to ask him questions as she would want to "@Born free  DPSA has minimal implications or involvement to the best of my own understanding Phillip Cwazibe ​@ Mark Waner ​Does He is caught off guard. He thought the truth would not come out. wow a year ago. A ruling please chair. Manyi wont respond to questions asked. 
56:37,59:15, Jimmy will get so bored with Zondo he will plead with Kate to ask him questions Zondo got the whole Manyi previous evidence in his head PLUS new evidence Democracy at its best "Fair from chair The taxpayer is paying and we demand answers its you that has the issue Jimmy His response will aun to waste time until they give up. Lies harder to m=remember than truth Truth is easy to remember. Lies on the other hand are tricky. 
59:23,1:02:13, "Zondo must make a ruling We want to know why... So let's begin. yoh if lying was a person Mr Manyi is gonna answer the questions but commission must learn to be fsir I'm hoping that Zondo will make recommendation against cadre-deployment and the current version of BEE. Those are the root causes of corruption and incompetence. you have to reveal some of the explicit details. the numbers are too vague He was a played well speak up he is protecting names of relevance Hofmeyr take your bags and leave this nonsonso. Go girl.... 
1:02:20,1:03:59, Zondo is a very patient man 😄😄😄😄 CLARITY - TIME - UNDERSTANDING. Go for his jugular Ms Hoffmeyer haha! You go girl! Super😂😂😂Now I am gonna roast your behind Rumble in the jungle. 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐑🐑🐑🐑 😂🤣😂 uncle Jimmy

1:07:16,1:08:43, Manyi ufuna miss Gcabashe This lady is super-slick. His head is perspiring.. nervous Would never get into an argument with Kate it's how life transpires... contradictions... coming towards paradise... I wonder how... makhosi nobhatyi I dont think so. Gcabashe is sharp too. I am sure he wants Mr Mokoena. 
1:08:46,1:09:46, 🥵 Adv Hofmeyr is detailed and prepared in her approach........ I like her Just imagine Zuma the sweat would be pouring down the commission would have to provide buckets @ Born free 🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅 He sounds scared or Jo Jo's SABCnews can you also address sound please!! We want to hear him clearly. "Yolo please ADV HOFFMEYER PLS RESTORE THIS COUNTRY .SEND THEME TO POLSMOOOOOOR PLS 
1:10:16,1:13:01, SICK IN THE HEAD Zuma the artful dodger @SABC Digital News Please check the sound "mandisi ntauzana "Zuma is practicing ""sick"" so that he can eventually get the same ""medical parole"" that the very healthy Schaik got." my apologies chair. "@mandisi ntauzana Ntwana Ms Hofmeyer is always prepared to nail witness regardless how hostile or tougher they may be """Chair 
1:13:08,1:15:08, "pop corns ready different answer? "Former President is old people Miss Hoffman 😊😊😊😊 "Born free there is no ONE answer... chair is correct. I've had time to reflect Zuma will carry on apealing and being sick until he dies of old age. Zuma he has to service many wives he can not be sick Lies 
1:15:20,1:16:35, @mandisi ntauzana And we all knew that the shower thing was not going to work. "Lol Pastor hahahaha eish yall don't have chill "DCJ please @Pastor J @mandisi ntauzana low blow whats with the crackling in the audio Can you imagine that Zuma will not take case to appeal for years and years if he is found guilty on the 783 counts of fraud and racketeering? joy in adv eyes...🤣🤣 .. The commission will have to ask Zuma'snany wives if he is too ill. 
1:16:59,1:18:50, were you charged or not? answer the question Zondo putting words in his mouth again uManyi usanya nangoku Zumas' wives will lose their luxury benefits if he is convicted. They may hope he dies before finally having his day in court. @Tebogo Makoro ...sorrreeeee ma. I repeated what he told the entire nation. no offence intended. @James Godloza Godloza 😂😂😂😂😂why are you killing me Is this new studio for the commission? Haha yes.. Dominique.. very true 
1:18:56,1:20:15, Manyi Manyi.. technicalities!! Bathathe boy technicality...lol "Yes @Tumi Sereme This is temporary She's fine plz chair leave to her to grill this clown "Tholithemba Ntsele do you call this ""clever""?" Mr Manyi is a Harvard alumni He thought he was gonna get a court order of charges ahah @ Tumi Sereme ​Is this new studio for the commission. It is for today and tomorrow only. and this guy was the DG of labour 
1:20:36,1:22:15, lol charges were rescinded and therefore Manyi thought he was not charged "@mandisi ntauzana no he isn't "Anyone who thinks Manyi is clever is either paid to say so Lol yes he got a certificate in Geology Economics or something like that "He lied and said he was never charged seems like mr money is moving the definition "Tholithemba fortified? 
1:22:18,1:23:54, well innocent until proven guilty Spin doctors can fool the public but not so easy to fool a concourt judge. "Mr Manyi is swimming between the lines "Brennan Fredericks Indeed I see you GUPTA'S PUPPET! India the most overpopulated and polluted country Intention to charge and being charged are two easily distinguished WHITE MONOPOLY CAPITAL PUPPETS ARE UP IN ARMS ALSO 😛 Make sure that your Pampers Nappies are on properly tightened Jimmy Boy. I can see the beeeeg one coming 
1:24:03,1:26:37, I'll live where I like PUPPET! Over-populating is biggest problem for poor countries. They won't recover until they can stop making more babies than they can support. @Pastor J 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 He remebers pay day intwana yami!! Jimmy Jimmy Precisely.. Dominique PEACE PEOPLE Clolonialism has nothing to do with this enquiry Cut their strings! 😁 So are the apartheid agents out here!! 
1:26:39,1:28:52, Manyi is going to jail... "Apartheid ended 25 years ago I didnt know that Mr Mdladlana is still alive. He did not get paid and then he was paid.. strange bad audio. Can still get paid up till end of month if fired. continue please Mr Manyi is easy I am easy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 
1:29:10,1:30:06, uneasy is easy Hahaha you are easy because you wasted 2 hours of our time. Hahahahaha sprung up on a person No longer at ease Mr Manyi is guilty. Now that was easy... 😊 Surprises!!!! Doesn't remember disciplinary hearing but does remember which lawyers he employed for the hearing? he is flexible Why must you given documentation 
1:30:12,1:31:22, Carry on convincing yourself that apartheid ended years ago. We dont even have land after many years some settlers stole it!! Zondo wants to go home "Dominic 😂😂😂 @Sthakathi Khumalo you are on the wrong site sprung up on person Mr Manyi😂😂 Lies have short legs. patience is key "Jane .Blamire I am responding to someone 
1:31:22,1:32:49, Bring a bucket and spade GUPTA PUPPET I dnt like this manyi thing @Sthakathi Khumalo If land was stolen it was stolen when population was about 3 million so the extra new 50 million did not have their land 'stolen'. who testifying now? NN2........... The letter is a revelation Those statistics are so petty and premature. I will not dignify that with a response @Simon Davies . I ask respectfully and need to be enlightened. Apartheid laws changed 25 years ago but do you honestly believe that in practice that people who practised apartheid changed with the law @Skhakhathi I agree. My question is who is allocating land to farmers or whites. These ppl are moving up and down in our land freely. something is not right here. 
1:33:00,1:35:35, "Anywayss NN5.......... NN2........ Mr Manyi is gonna deal with this "Academic Editors "Tholithemba Ntsele Noted Heather why? he is just ventilating his views even if you disagree with them Yes most of them have Pastor. I refer you to the referendum that denounced the practise in 1992? They voted AGAINST apartheid I respect and accept that view @Simon Davies "Moshoeu Mabusela Its our ANC that sits with them but opposing views will obviously be divisive 
1:35:56,1:38:14, Says who....proo proof sensitive matter "Thanks Pastor you appear to be a reasonable man Sthakathi Khumalo ​ Really? The Norwegian ambassador must come and sing. Debate people and dont name us things when we challenge your views!! "@mandisi ntauzana A different opinion is one thing "@Sthakathi Khumalo After 25 years of ANC rule our country is bankrupt. Let's hope our politicians get advice from people who know how to run a country successfully 
1:38:17,1:40:39, Ok Derek I hear you You bribed him bloody crook Lies in defense of himself Stop throwing tantrums and just admit your complicity in state capture. How much are they paying you to appear so stupid this afternoon? 😉 "Ppl are getting rich in our country I smell bribery here What is racist by saying inequality is still alive and white people are still benefiting from the past. Land that is productive is still under the arms of a certain minority.. Unless I am wrong You bribed her and you failed. @Sthakathi Khumalo That is our problem. State capture and our unions have no interest in productivity. 
1:40:48,1:42:49, Get the ambassador to testify Hahahaha lol this guy @Sthakathi Khumalo Why don't you go back through the comments and see if there is any racism there? Prissy hiiii "Thando Nkutha Kuthiwa ndiRacist phela Word for word adv Kata Kate The problem is you entered my discussion with someone through the window and who became insultive to our views!! This is why youve missed everything 
1:43:00,1:45:59, Derek Main Unions are South Africa's downfall.. there are other ways to support employees and their rights.. not these unions which make alot of money from their members6 Our views??? So you've got accomplices here 😂😂😂 Norsk 🤔 @Sthakathi Khumalo I was here reading the comments - just didn't want to get involved. I don't like associating with racists at all. Nice admission! he's now passing buck around I don't trust his answers on this issue "@Sthakathi Khumalo While I agree there are many issues that need to be addressed Looks like the chair respects Manyi too much. 
1:46:26,1:49:45, @Thando Nkutha I didn't say he was - I just think he was defending one. Derek Main Fair enough bro but be consistent when some people call others names when they have nothing more to say or generally challenged We need Rassie Erasmus to come in as coach to the government. Teach them how to get our country to be a winner rather than the loser which the world is sadly watching. @Sthakathi Khumalo I try to be consistent but I choose my battles. Sometimes it's just not worth it. Some people cannot reason. Who Thando Nkutha? when Africans can become independent and lead their countries into a prosperous Independent country and stop relying on European handouts.. then you have a right to Independence and prosperity. Haai Guys can we get back top manyis evidence @Thando Nkutha I can do that. I haven't blocked him - I generally like seeing his point of view. mr manyi had a conflict of interest and was called out on it 
1:49:51,1:52:32, MANYI IS BUSY DROWNING IN HIS OWN WORDS. I have been with @Derek Main and many others on this chat since the start of the commission last year and I can say that Derek has never been a racist and will defend against it. @Pastor J Thanks Pastor - appreciate the support. "Conflict of intrest mchana "Thando Nkutha I am not racist just a realist.. @Yolo More Please indicate what I have said which is racist. He won’t remember this letter His body language says he does not like being questioned by her 
1:52:46,1:53:49, How is Dominic a racist? This is getting a bit like trying to find someone who voted for the Nats 😁 @Thando Nkutha I did pray and continue to do so. I have also prayed for your naughteee roving eyes upon Young Kate. hahahahahaha Dont recall...here we go "Yoh "@Pastor J I concur He wont recall everything from now on. Mr Manyi is dealing with thee questions correctly and I think he will come up tops and doesn't have anything to hide. Norman Zwane Uvukaphi nkunzi?? 
1:54:04,1:55:07, So he indirectly disclose his conflict of interest and yet call the issue frilious.... Ms Hofmeyer is really sharp she caught Thank you @Norman Zwane . And offcourse you have also been on the chats since the beginning bro Manyi again lied "Yes you dare not critize @Thando Nkutha hahaha Conflict of interest "One just has to read on social media Refresh "mandisi ntauzana He is being caught left and right 
1:55:11,1:56:44, @Thando Nkutha And you will be blindfolded whilst she talks Ms Hofmeyer has him in a corner 🍦🍦🍦 Echo...Echo... @Sthakathi Khumalo Mtungwa ngiqubile nje kodwa kubhenguza umoya engithi angiwukhuze ngo @Derek Main. Angabhecwa ngobubende iqatha engalitholanga. Hahahahahahahaha "If its wrong that's so correct And he deem the report malicious.... 😂😂😂 
1:57:14,1:58:22, @Helen Terry My issue is with generalising. I'm no ninow @Thando Nkutha Are you in love nkunzana? Whaaaat What was Manyi's stunt all about because now he is responding nicely to the questions. "@He lives in you Truth depends on your point of view. ""There are none so blind as those who will not see.""" "Norman Zwane Kuhle Mangethe I will read tonight 😂😃😃 @Norman Zwane He is always in love when this girl is questioning. We had a fight about that Molefe girl as well. @Thando Nkutha .hahahahahahahaha 
1:58:35,2:01:35, cant generalize..although many things are screepily general behavious 😃 "Hahaha broad spectrum conflicts between the wealthy and the poor. He has lots of reading tonight...LOL "l like Ms Hofmeyer He was lying "how many of us @Pastor J has the PP (Thuli) testified at the Commission? Jimmy is not sleeping tonight 
2:01:41,2:03:38, "@Pastor J In isiZulu we say: ""Akukho soka ladla kahle izimbangi zikhala"" Allow this witness to talk @Dylan Jacklin Not yet but she has to at some stage to confirm the findings and any disputed subsequent evidence. It will make sense if she comes late in the process Mr Manyi must call Adv Hofmeyr kahle not Hoffmann Hoffman 🤣🤣🤣 "Go bokke 👍Heather 😂😂😂 his thinking of Hoffnan Square ib Bloem...lol continue 
2:03:42,2:04:41, I am worried about Pirates @Pastor J is there a date by which the Commission must end? @Norman Zwane Yes. You are right. We had a crush on that one too until she fell asleep on the job. But then again both Thando and I are just old naughteee buggers Dylan Jacklin no. Her reports were not challenged so they speak for her. early please @born free 😂 This guy he looks tired jaaa🥃 The budget and period has already been extended by a Court Order with options to extend. It seems 3 years is probable and likely 2 hours for Manyi.
