Look at Jabu Mabuza at Eskom was hired by Jamnandas @Sthakathi Khumalo ....yes Des had relevant experience..... he bankrupted the Klerksdorp municipality just before he was appointed as FM.....and his brief was to bankrupt the country.... Jamnandas and Cyril are busy looting and setting up state capture... while people are still obsessed with Guptas and Zuma. No stone will remain unturned @Eliot Chauke ...Is what you saying true? any evidence at all of your allegations.? Have you reported any of this to the authorities as yet? Just interested

"wena Pastor... when Zondo commission concludes @Eliot Chauke ...Mfuwethu wam....Still no evidence etc? "redriger Look the finance sector is controlled by a certain cabal @Elvis Malakoane ...thank you Elvis.... but the facts remain the same The evidence is in North Gauteng High Court... Cyril said it must be sealed... yes facts are correct "Robert Russell My point was selective treatment bro 
51:28,53:06, Eskom was a going concern @Redriger i said I support an African Child... and i vote EFF. dnt misrepresent the facts Evidence is sealed when it comes to holier goats "you poke holes in the ship then want to point at the crew after you jump ship @redriger ...The prevalent confusion pertaining to the individual is conclusive and evident. The higher standard in my language is intentional to create confusion to the reader. Elliott Chauke you are ryt bro Pastor J is ignoring the truth which is happening now..CR emails..rogue..judges paid money..etc "pls @Hloniphani Ndlela ...Be brave.Give me a single name of a Judge who has been paid money illegaly or in a corrupt manner. 
53:28,55:46, I do concede Zuma had his issues but we should maintain fairness when it comes to these things. "@ Khumalo you not stating the fact sir Gordhan and Eskom executives try to fix the damage left by Guptas Narcissistic people remain strong in their point of view and like decoy "@pastor the name of the judges "They denied rogue unit @Eliot Chauke ...sealed where baba.? "but dont worry @Pastor J i said North Gauteng High Court... Just saying a fact.....Eskom WAS othe best run and profitable state entity PRE 1994......now think aboot that......ne 
55:48,57:55, @Eliot Chauke ...Eff must first release the VBS money for the poor to enjoy Christmas first. Skelms "makhosi nobhatyi The Zuma cabal refused to sign IPPS thats the actual truth bro pastor J Google Peit Rampedi now..he was talking live on TV if there is no such Y can't they challenge him..being quiet is da proof he even said they must challenge him he's a available pastor j Pravin Gordhan is hated because he chose the country over corruption and Cyril Ramaphosa can be called names but he stole no money @redriger u trying hard to be funny. "@ Khumalo yes we need to be fair but take away politics so you will see problem we are in as a country "Pravin Gordhan is a real problem @pastor u expect me to take u serious? vbs song😂😂. how much did eff steal from vbs and how Piet Rampedi is a clown that works with Iqbal Survy they looted money from PIC 
58:13,1:00:19, Alex Industrials You deserve to be blocked wena!! @Hloniphani Ndlela ...I agree with you that bribery of judges may have happened. You say it as a fact so give us a name. @ Khumalo you are too defensive brother as if you get your share 😂😂😂 but mna I am sober if CR is found guilty of wrongdoing we will deal with it later I cannot run around look what he has done can we all pray for our country which is destroyed by politicians anybody who is clean gets vilified by most corrupt people no judge has been bought here that is a lie Hebana! @Eliot Chauke ....Currently...VBS are the biggest thieves at the moment. Read Daily Maverick etc. Julius is going to Tronk in the next 3 months.4sure Mbaks Cyril is stealing through WMC nd Pravin chose his business interests over the country..he was against corruption bcoz Gupta's were closing their..das how it works. 
1:00:30,1:02:29, @Pastor J. im saying the info is sealed. wat more do u want. the name of judges and amount received is sealed... @Pastor J ....don't forget the thug FLOYD next to him in tronk as well I dont read Daily Maverick "@Eliot Chauke ...And when they unseal it and the page is blank "makhosi nobhatyi The CR17 GOV has made more expenditure AND LOSSES than Zuma UNTIL today Cyril Ramaphosa spoilt the stealing fun now crooks are possess off with him You don't seal anything without incriminating evidence hehe @Robert Russell ..My apologies for seemingly having left him out. I normally call him Vetboy i read all newspapers because i don't want to bias my views. 
1:02:35,1:04:43, "@Pastor j b patient daily marverick is for discrediting black leadership who wants to transform economy Zuma cannot afford his children school fees "@Eliot Chauke why is eff not publishing it now wait nd see da day Moyane cross examine Pravin Government is judged after 5 years sir what you see so far is Zuma administration not yet CR17 all he tried now to save our economy not to fall so stop lying here @ Khumalo @Hloniphani Ndlela .....you talking crap...Bra......they report on the truth...facts "@khumalo this is politics @Lorraine Naidoo ...Its difficult to send children to school when you have 24 of them and then stealing tap is closed. How did he afford it when the Gupta uncles where still here? 
1:05:13,1:07:37, 🤣 Paster he isloaded @Lorraine Naidoo ...Thats what I thought Kanna leaders are born and arise to their position by virtue of the unselfishness of their actions. I'm not sure what strange concept of leadership you have He should ask Duduzane to send some of his money from Dubai. "if your position is strong @Pheladi Lamola ...yes he did chow... he and his family had all expenses holiday to Dubai to the value of almost R700k...paid for by the Docrat family who won the tender... make of that what you want of thought. "This Zuma and EFF nonsense is frustrating. Whilst they where and are busy stealing 
1:07:48,1:09:29, I doubt there's any veracity about Zuma being broke You're absolutely right @Robert Russel "@ Eliot Chauke I am sober in mind I state facts but Khumalo defense is prematurely coz There is a problem with our ex president Zuma Okay when you are hungry and without a decent existence you will resort to extremes and this is the situation we have. people with privilege need to acknowledge and share their knowledge "This GUPTA narrative will run out of steam at some point but this intellectually bankrupt rhetoric is sickening this people are so corrupt and they hide behind lying and i tell you they have joint venture with the Satan refusing to read a newspaper! can you ever? as if your position is so weak that one article will sway you. are you scared? 
1:10:19,1:13:41, I pray that when Zuma gets his free issue orange jumpsuit that it will not have a zip in front. No baby 25 The Commies /Socialists are at play here..... "Andrew Coleman sell SAA assets Cwele was a useless stooge. Dudu Myeni and Brian Molefe are thieves @Sthakathi Khumalo ....I can'r recall.... was Coleman Andrews black or white? Robert Russell WHITE!! To whom @redriger? the whole country is in a 9yr mess of Zuma administration with Guptas 
1:14:48,1:22:33, "Wow...then he understood the concept of ""OFF Balance Sheet Financing""... @Sthakathi Khumalo" Oh I don't know @redriger. It was hard to keep tabs on what's happening during Zuma years Robert Russell The guy scored a handshake of 220 million after the sale of SAA planes that time SAA was making profits.. Robert Russell no story will replace Zuma corruption No right thinking person can defend Zuma mess @redriger ....I tell you....It shows a lack of capacity by individuals to be constructive and factual. Thats my ineterpretation of the word itself @Elvis Malakoane ...A mess i dont mind. Zuma left a disaster worst than the recent tornadoes "No oe is defending Zuma sithetha ngeyiphi minister Minister Siyabongwa Cwele 
1:22:40,1:28:23, pastor j yes and yet you see people clowning around with pseudo theories about Cyril and Pravin @Sthakathi Khumalo I fully agree with your last statement based on facts and not hollowed allegations prevailing. agreed redriger true Audio is broken @pheladi thank you Abel Matshidiso I want to share your sentiment but remember he was behind Bulelani spy lie story @Abel Matshidiso ....I think you might have a point....I'm not sure that MO is a Pro Golfer "To be honest @Robert Russell love to know his handicap 
1:28:54,1:32:45, Try ZUMA @Rob Nel @Rob Nel ...I know his handicap Not the Dubai handicap......heheheh Malema for Prison I find him a shifty dude. perhaps too much spying? zondo has been consisted. He listens and has patients. @kung fu kenny what happen to him "Also the pocket hanky @Raymond Mabilo There is now proof of him looting VBS and Shivambu 
1:33:24,1:37:33, lol water gate He's matching with the tie Rob. 👌 Still too flashy nhlanhla nkosi 😂😂😂😂 PROBLEMS OF CRAMMING NARRATIVES Agree 100% with Mo. How are you going to teach that ethos to the ANC??????? "Adv Pretorius @redriger we follow this commission. credibility of witnesses we see it from far. Too much power corrupts. 
1:38:11,1:48:01, @funicanz ...You are absolutely right. And we have never been wrong about the credibility judgments we have made on this forum "@Pastor J I like the theory of “dependence creation”. Spot on "Finally the the other side comes alleged* I'm liking this Mo Shaik today. "redriger I am listening bro redriger I am actually Xhosa 😓 "ADV September a snack of note 
1:48:27,1:55:03, Guptas must have given Zuma something to eat that made him soooo blind even not to see comebacks I am sure I just saw Adv Septmeber walking in her sleep again. Elvis Malakoane The UPTAS were working with Duduzane and so who would you trust in this process as Nxamalala? Guptas must have given Zuma something to eat that made him soooo blind even not to see comebacks Spices sthakathi khumalo yaaaah neh ! Zuma enjoys much back up from intelligent of Guptas to blind Anc as if there was people who want to chopped up him which works for him then but it couldn’t last longer here we are today heard how he.. why don't we do an audit on the Zuma family before him becoming president and after cwele 
1:55:11,2:00:29, "GUPTAS maintained dominance since Mandela times Cwele is going to have to come here and state his case. He's such a boring character but one will just have to grin and bear it through his testimony. sthakathi khumalo so you are actually saying under Mandela they did not steal but under Zuma they got freeway to the purse @Sthakathi Khumalo please don’t lied these guys was nothing even to mr Mbeki only gained power by co operating system to enrich themselves and Zuma family by using Duduzane @Elvis Malakoane Thats exactly what he said. hehehehehe "They probably stole @makhosi nobhatyi 1000% correct "makhosi nobhatyi OHO keep lying to yourself GUPTAS had influence during Mandela & Mbekis time "@Sthakathi Khumalo ...You use the word ""probably"" and ""alledgedly"" so often that I am now convinced 
2:00:50,2:03:32, Pastor J Give me your facts @Sthakathi Khumalo What did the guptas do during mandela and mbet "The issues about Zuma are history agree with us @Sthakathi Khumalo That cant be a get out free card. "@redriger @ Pastor J this is clear @Sthakathi Khumalo what did the guptas do during mandela and mbeki's tenure? Guptas were friends of Thabo Mbeki; they donated to many to many organised events; had many business partners. The moment they were seen with Jacob Zuma - they were corrupt. The commission is toothless and noone will go to jail and so what's the point. Only the poor do jail time. 
2:03:35,2:07:59, sthakathi khumalo you must not block your eyes to the truth because you end up believing yourself sir @enneth khumalo. There is untested information that the Gupta brothers started their business during Mbeki era. @Sthakathi Khumalo so they only become corrupt once the met Zuma sthakathi is just the devils advocate here. arguing just for the sake of it "@ dm70 you cannot just focus on economy without finding what went wrong otherwise every president will do as he or she pleases no one will asked Look comrades the GUPTAS BECOME THE PROBELM AS SOON AS THEY WORK WITH ZUMA I don't know how can people not see that Zuma presidency destroyed black middle class "Albert its a fact the Guptas have been around even in Mandela's time. People are only focusing on Zuma chair and intervals 
2:07:59,2:12:15, @ridriger arm’s deal remember he still has share there Dm70 what does that have to do with the past 2 terms Zuma was in charge @Elvis my problem exactly the Zuma protectors do not love their own country i really find it difficult to understand @funicanz . The intervals are OK but I also think they should help the evidence leader by arranging a seat for the evidence leader. "Nhlanhla dm 70 did Mandela bankrupt SAA did Mbeki take money from eskom or denels "James Dm70 why waste time investigatin Mandela and mbeki for what Zuma allowed to happen Remember the book called “ The gate keepers “ it exactly what Khumalo did. No stone will remain unturned @ ridriger 
2:12:42,2:23:19, "Zuma took no money from any parastals so you are saying Zuma was so useless people used his name to collapse the country with his son @#dm70.....hahahahahahaha.hehehehehe. stop being follish really guys who defend Zuma you are damaging him than helping him with your inuendos @Abel Matshidiso. Resuming at 1625Hours can any one inform chair that his time is wrong Maybe he lost his timekeeper queue at the bathroom ZOBO? 
2:23:27,2:31:18, now he's like he is in other country because of his watch "Y'all are referencing untested BOOKS what one may call propaganda @Sthakathi Khumalo ...Do you believe that Zuma should be prosecuted or not??? we will talk about CR17 separately "Thats a petty argument Pastor J Everyone involved in wrong doing must be given a chance to state their case and be examined. Whether its Zuma or CR17 or myself.. "So what is the problem with evidence being presented on him Pastor J The problem is you are not listening... I was making commentary on the books which are deemed as facts here but the veracity of their claims have not been volunteered to the commission! My questions are based on your comments before the book issue even started.@Sthakathi Khumalo redriger How do you know that 
2:31:35,2:36:15, State capture started with Zuma? "Pastor J I have mentioned that fairness should be maintained "The reason why we can't get rid of corruption or get politicians to account are people who justify the unjustifiable @Sthakathi Khumalo ....You are unique and rare. The only one who does not know about the Gupta/Zuma corrupt relationship and how the other fools got drawn in like donkeys and goats. be real @Sthakathi Khumalo ...Inquiries and investigations is a process. one at a time. be patient Zuma was just president by proxy "He is not unique but blind supporter @ Sthakathi Khumalo. Actually CR feared being fired from the ANC by the president. The main problem is giving too much powers to the Office of Presidency I think not so long ago DCJ advised us not to be in a hurry for conclusion of this commission 
2:36:19,2:43:20, He should be charged with treason. A whole president prevented an investigation into the Guptas hello We are listening attentively hehe ; Wassup @Roza essack . We missed you today simamele nyani The laws of Nature will always expose anyone who violate them We missed @Danie Nilsen tto while he was watching on the Enca channel...hehehehehe 
2:44:03,2:51:17, Zuma is never gonna return to the commission. He'll be chronically ill from now on. How is he going to deal with what Mo is saying? @Pastor J hi did i miss anything Nothing much Danie. We normally know what crap they will talk about even when they dont.hahahaha @Abel Mashitisho they're ending at 5. 🎫🎫🎫🎫😁 "Cwele's wife dealt in drugs and our ""intelligence "" minister was none the wiser. Go figure." something dumbfound me how can Mo want to speak to zuma about the investigation given the fact he ate curry at saxon world she's a convicted drug dealer now danie maybe Mo wanted the curry recipe 
2:51:23,2:53:10, so the president did say stop it kyk zuma gaan bollie It must have been a lot. Her accomplice was a Nigerian brother so you can imagine it was serious stuff like the ssnake bit himself Mo time lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣 did sge get caught fir nyaope or rattex 😂😂 Mo Salah testifying still? can we do a citizen arrest on Zuma. 
2:53:29,2:56:35, cutting zumas head off "It's a joke ! A single plane landed at Waterkloof carrying Gupta guests.? but a whole airport at OR Tambo  "Mo Shaik @Johannes and I will be the judge no trial for Zuma lol😂 "@james No trial "do not forget the 40 landrovers bmw lol The concern here is that these guys knew something that was a threat to the state and didn't take it any further. Or is it their hands were tied because they could not challenge the President Rasheed Ally Selective treatment in the country is at play here. Today we heard someone will be cross examined based on terms and conditions imagine! 
2:56:38,2:58:51, dont know what they snorted though "Waterkloof is not just an airport "they all failed us. No president shud b the head of the intelligence services im sure that dudu was also busy with this drug story @Governder when the president spoke they were scared to lose their jobs Zuma was born corrupt @redriger ...Yes he is. Cowdung In an ideal world that Gupta plane would have been shot down. That's how serious it was. Granny u are right 
2:58:53,3:00:18, no but he must be on something glue maybe he forgets alot alzeimers aslo slips in here @redriger .....reckon currie powder mixed with some muti or something....heheh Pheladi it shud have been shot down. we should also remember Zuma is very clever he's got two heads a fighter jet shud have been scrambled cowdung mixed with chilli powder Exactly @Sekgololo Johannes. People here defending the indefensible. @Roza essack ...hahahahahahaha. I detest such people. 
3:00:22,3:03:59, Remember ....the Commies schooled Zumatjie very well indeed...... true they did this Mo as well Johannes Zuma made sure we don't have the fighter jet he stole that money with talles we have 13 griffons fighter jets only 2 operational Dont trust any of these ANC people......... @james this country is in trouble. we have ministers who don't even know civilian planes are landing at airforce/military base. Well...spaced out.....heheh duduzane just played the nice hand he was dealt 5 aces lol Zuma should be tried for treason to discourage others from betraying their countries. 
3:04:26,3:06:06, Well...some Durban Poison...could also have been sniffed etc...... Mo bombshell that will shaik us "@Govender africa let the old men die and not take jail time eeeee ..Kings are to take advantage of the servants. National Security knows what a president does but withhold the information. @James Godloza Godloza 😂😂😂😂 @Danie Nielsen what on earth are you smoking clean weed
