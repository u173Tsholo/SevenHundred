The politics of distraction..... sound bit low @Thando he is 53 he's a bit young I also thought he was contradicting him self. 
34:49,40:05, baby face he's got a baby face ya he does look young... but i was wondering how old he was when he started at NT and what he did before that... his age and work experience for the majority blacks he was lucky... does look young yes 54 years old cabinet reshuffle at 15h00 "@Thando he mentioned his few qualifications in the beginning he looks younger than 54 years His head of standard bank i believe 
40:19,45:24, yep "Bafethu Has a Masters Degree Yes very straightforward too ha this ladies lk this man lol "Fuzile is a Master of Commerce graduate. Began his career as a school teacher "He's got BComm ladies what about maleka?bbyface? 
45:43,49:07, I have hope when I see people like Mr Fuzile He also mentioned some other studies with certification and others without certification... hard working brother Mr Fuzile is really an impressive man! beyonce and kelly this guy is brilliant can now understand why he is in such high demand kelly manyisa What is he doing now? is he still in the ANC? The ANC is full of people like Fuzile. Just that the system keep them at the backgroung and put some half baked people at the front So far Mr Fuzile is the type of servants SA needs 
49:34,54:46, agree with you Bibby @Desmond Masilela CEO Standard bank Currently he is Chief Executive & Executive Director of SBSA... hands up Fuzile you are one of the people south africa needs in hard times It puzzles me why ANC keeps recycling and deploying old and crooked people where they have such talent... mxim Unfortunately Thando zuma was and is not competent in this type of matter he is just best in singing to whip gullible people emotion to blindly support him 🤣 @Thando 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 So was the state captured or not? 
56:23,1:01:21, When was it released again? "All is not doomed with SA. When we look at people like Mr Fuzile from Monday we will do things in accordance with the law. that was power Fuzile. Reshuffle?

You guys have all the fun. Watching from Portugal. 
1:33:24,1:40:28, in the last 10 years we can't see the Forrest from the trees Portugal... you follow South African politics who wishes that EFF was asking the questions because these people are here bcz of them dont ever say that again 'nice legs'she is my wife i wish gerrie nel was asking the questions this is not court err it should be scroll up and read my comments for some context time to pray 
1:40:35,1:59:33, "This guy must FINISH tomorrow we HAVE 1996 .. References to “nice legs” and “she’s my wife” exposes one to Crimean injuries claims. Restraint on social media important. Too many such references on this live chat. Third India-Africa Forum Summit hehhe any suggestions for a party to vote TN "deputy pres. promise them a house with a bed and stove must b joking 
2:00:41,2:05:31, scary suggestion if you do that you are brainless hehehehe let's all remember that this enquiry platform is here courtesy of the EFF. I’m voting DA coz the best ran municipalities in SA are all DA ran. vote eff and loot another bank and your comrades are stealing your goats even scarier than TN's suggestion @Thando tell me of one country that was a democratic country and is now back to the olden days of oppression because of new leadership? "Mayor Herman Mashaba revealed affordable housing for the people of Gauteng yesterday 
2:06:41,2:11:01, "So @Thando my problem TN DA is governing thanks to EFF in 2 metros "@Syanda  @Thando EFF is led by greedy people who want to rule and continue where the ANC left of mxm It’s sad but that’s what’s happening now @Leon "All i can say is toe the line my fellow south Africans Another thing...I would not want my son to behave like the EFF does in Parliament. They resort to noise and violent if better points are raised against them mxm. if we tolerate this then your children will be next. Lol Thando go ahead do that. I don’t get why for me 2 be black means I should associate with the hooliganism of the EFF? 
2:12:12,2:15:23, No @Thando I want my child to know that u don’t respect someone coz of their skin color but coz they deserve and have earned that respect really? props What does color have to do with well ran municipalities @Thando? "Thando EFF is the most racist party I’ve seen so far. "Typical EFF will never vote for DA and will never support anybody in bed with DA. "Tumi’ if u stay in PTA 
2:16:14,2:21:46, "Just like in 2019 the party for all people will rule The more we fight the more we loose. @Thando u can go shove that membership where the sun doesn’t shine 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 456 guys you guys sound reasonably intelligent ... act like it. "@ANC was better under Mandela and Mbeki i give up. hi all what happened to Mazibuko and Delile 
2:23:16,2:29:00, @Mazibuko had to go study at Oxford. De Lile and DA we’re not seeing eye to eye she decided to leave. It saddens me that the EFF is led by people who are educated and intelligent but act barbaric in Parliament. I feel sorry for my fellow brothers who see nothing wrong with their behavior 😒😒 i thought it was when.... lost of words #Tshesaaa Siyanda how barbaric? Glasses off 😶 @siyanda is living in the bast "@Shai Pravin was noot asked though Maleka Maybe you tuned in late @siyanda. He started it and got burned
