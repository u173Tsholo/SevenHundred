2:48:03,2:52:55, The board destroyed the report? It's the strangest thing. This board was a law unto themselves. It was not a Board. It was a collection of corruption enablers. They are all a law unto themselves they have no regard for mandatory regulations or due process. Malema in court and hopefully Jail soon. Why is Malema's wife always wearing a wig? is this woman a colourd or english? Venetia Klein must return to answer about the destroyed report Because wigs are beautiful 😀 
2:53:02,2:56:15, Juju is in Sandton buying new clothes Malema op jou bek kry ja She is an English speaking Coloured "Pious all the board members of Eskom are corrupt past and present. Correct Stanley She is making herself look stupid trying to protect obviously fatcat corrupt faction ... destroying evidence 🙈🙈 She has used Tresemme to straighten her hair .😁 
2:56:40,2:59:24, Hou jou bek RESPECT PLEASE "that's why they all needs to be jailed  "can we please refrain from the race card and focus on the issue at hand hope you spelling correctly on the group chat I submitted to no company keep in mind I'm a Graphic design in training for the first time anc is gonna pay the trip to Harare. I wonder is how much? recovery of lostv her race colour and nationality do not matter. its not really cool. "Full agreement Kido 
2:59:31,3:01:45, Did Ms Klein say anything about the destroyed report? I may have missed it. recovery of lost state funds is important here than criminal "Pheladi "let us avoid using the race card Agreed Joyce agreed Joyce agreed Another rough day for Suzie "Keegan 
3:01:47,3:10:33, 800 million bribery 🤣🤣🤣 @ joyce tendai Zvavareyi ... exactly.. there's only one race ....human... there're different ethnic groups... I thought it will be today Samuel Bongiwe Leslie Salute on the side can we register my company with absa I have so much respect for her now. remember she could be your wife sister mother aunt or nana or whatever relationship that could have existed. She can try and go and rest shortly and may need very serious protection. thank you sis Well she's answered the questions well... so it looks like she can keep her chin up... both of them 😅 o kae 
3:10:35,3:15:17, that's true Hope she gets home safely now safe house? sadly it's got to be a safe house surely. No one will be looking for someone who is blatantly lying ... who is blatantly lying? I missed a lot guys... overall do you think she was she being honest? Unless those people she's lying for gets wise ... Or has she been lying? 
3:15:27,3:17:22, explain the lying. I certainly believe so ... There is no way that she could concoct her evidence the 800 mil is far fetched "Body language obviously shows she is protecting big thiefs there were instances that she lied and judge zondo had to remind her of what she said previously maybe its the nerves Oh... Henrique have you been listening from the beginning? Certainly haven’t heard all lies Did they have an affair? 
3:17:30,3:20:19, nerves Big fish any one bigger than the Guptas? Guptas are bigger than Zuma for your infor and if you follow properly you have no leg to stand on dont know coz she seemed to be forgetful 800 mil bribery??? She overtook Jonas it appears she never received any kickbacks that's what puzzles me 800mil offer... ABC she’s been solid except for instances of remembering word for word and dates Thobani🤣🤣 Big names? 
3:20:43,3:23:43, From that point on she seemed and sounded more accurate with her recollection Well she definitely looks scared... perhaps she's afraid they'll get her later... The tweeting engineer will balance us here ... I believe in that fellow @Bongani Moeli 🤣😂🤣🤷🏾‍♂️🤣 "Tnobani See the speaking the truth is always better. She is kinda making sense now Well the DCJ basically told her not to insult his intelligence and from then on she had to get it right. DCJ is tasked to determine if she is lying. The comprehensive report will illustrate the outcome. @Pheladi Lamola 🤣 True It's exactly what Ms. Klein sought to do at first 
3:23:46,3:25:43, she just said they're lying straight out. Everyone lying except her 🤣🤣🤣 klein was at the center lying under oath "still remember Brian Molefe crying on National television in a news briefing Lack of action against those lying under oath has encouraged the behavior @Bongiwe Moeli My apologies Ausi 🌸👌🏽💥 hahaha fake tears lol "800 million 
3:25:45,3:28:02, u know Thobani🌸🌸 ohhhhhhh!!! snap "Sing Bird charge sheet was tempered with that would have seen koko gone Telling it like it is Didn't the Labour Court rule in favour of Koko after Eskom disputed the DC findings? This lady is gonna crumble under cross examination. @Nhlanhla Makhaye 🤔 She's barely keeping it together now ... 
3:28:03,3:30:28, nope. she will not crumble. she has notes. other witnesses could hardly remember their name "she did not say ""I do not recall""" She lied instead lol True Fred ooh snap "she played i do not recall card so many times that DCJ had to read frm the bundle to remind her "Indeed Lynne Brown tic tok Makhaye you are now insinuating things. you can join the dots easily. she was scared initially but was bold enough at the end. she is typical of a whistle-blower she knows what she is saying 
3:30:52,3:33:10, sorru Joyce axactly @Fred Desrosiers She had a new line 'I can't categorically recall' 🤣 she has been the witnesses that had the most notes. Of course her version is different then what other recalled. This cross examination of Koko and her is going to be fun 😅 This witness is not sure about the letter .what is she off. hahaha she lies this one it was an interesting day tx judge Koko was also capture. remember he alledgedly having sexcapades at Eskom 
3:33:14,3:34:29, better than Netflix anyday. there is no cross examination this is a commission of enquiry! "not a credible witness at all Bye everyone. Stay safe. Drink a lot of water and rest up BYE Best witness in my view. since 7 days of lies. bye What a day "You actually can apply to cross examine a witness if you've submitted an affidavit and have been implicated case in point Vytjie Mentor 
3:34:40,3:36:13, Best witness true. Bless. bye guys see you next week. she was great Take care all. I think she is a credible witness but lacks confidence. Buye no commission tomorrow folks?? she dropped names like candy. now more people are implicated we more of the circus comission resumes on Monday - next week 
3:36:38,3:42:27, when is the biggest fish coming to the commission Zuma without any shadow of doubt sold the Country to the Guptas can't wait for the man from nkandla he must come and account and go straight to sun city or polsmoor Hermione Cronje should hired these investigators from the Eskom Stream for seamless prosecutions can say that again @Moses Sowage big fish must to the commission is it finish now We need to call all those with longterm contracts at eskom because i believe they also reap off the country "places includes Mall
