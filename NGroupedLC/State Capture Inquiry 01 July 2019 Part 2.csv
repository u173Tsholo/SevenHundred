time,6:31,message I hope the technical issues are fixed on Part 2. Last session was filled with glitches & blackouts. Come on SABC. . .. . lovely dress she's wearing... . . How do you know it's a dress? @Wilhelm5381 
7:28,11:57, Nice to see someone who appears to be competent. It appears that Mama Dudu Myeni exceeded her fiduciary duties and was running SAA. Sky Chefs will win their law suit but it should be Myeni that's pays them from her very own purse. The abuse of BEE seems to follow a standard pattern. This witness is an honourable educated lady. Myeni certainly had all the loyalists removed. @Dominic Przybylski #ProudlyBroughtToYouByTheANC tendering should be abolished @Disemi Molta I agree it's flawed but what's the alternative. Tenders should not fall into the hands of the ANC "Nothing wrong with tendering. The problem is the people who use it in combination with ignorant ""beneficiaries"" who are confounded and manipulated." 
12:06,14:52, "I totally agree with you "Yes the hiring more youth the better "tendering has lot of loopholes which create room for corruption. it was meant to uplift the poor of the poorest Tenders should be procured by qualified people who are not affiliated to any party. I think we need to get much tougher on corruption. Something to really put off the thieves - like the Chinese model of execution for corruption. Tender is standard procedure for all large contracts private or public sector. It is way to obtain quotes. Without tenders there can be no quotes. The problem is the PEOPLE who adjudicate "but the ruling party is not considerate of those qualified people Bring back the death penalty 
15:03,18:06, once and for all @Disemi Molta Thank you so much "I'm not really a fan of the death penalty but for corruption more money which was supposed to create job is channeled to commissions after commission with no prosecution """Radical Transformation"" is the excuse for corruption." what is the role of vetting then? This was already on? Not live No sound All SOE procurement is politically skewed. 
18:17,21:47, @Born free That's not a bad idea - an independent company deciding on all government tenders so there can be no conflicts of interest. of course The government can carry on with transformation in the government but must leave the private sector alone. SABC Digital sound please centralise tender process rather "Government has run out of money and doesn't pay on time anyway so who wants to do business with them @Derek Main .... there is a wealth of retired acumen in our society.... run pre-awarded tenders past them to see if there is value for money..... before the final awards This government has destroyed many private companies and small to medium businesses they will never leave the private sector alone without us they have no money 
22:12,24:07, "more money is wasted on investigations and investigations It seems like this miss quinana has some questions to answer they are communists they dont understand business they just want its money @Kapn Krunch That's the gist of it. @Disemi Molta Tend to agree with you. Just look at the farce of an Arms Deal inquiry. It would be funny if it weren't so sad. look at ramaphosa a supposed business man announcing land expropriation without compensation with no plan on how they will do it giving investors cold feet the man doesn't understand business if he China is a communist country and no2 in the world monopoly did he wouldn't have done it like that "Derek 
24:47,26:21, @Kapn Krunch You are misrepresenting Cyril Ramaphosa for your own propagandistic end am I wrong? Lot of skeletons in Ramaphosa's closet. How did he become a billionaire simply by being a token BEE non-executive board member in a bunch of companies? Disemi - I'm with you all the way on that one but Zupta is a wily fox. My cynical side says he will get away with it. Either he will claim unfair it's taken so long or old age. what sort of business man does such a thing he didnt even reassure them and as a result we hit junk status shortly after "one issue brings other issues @Pastor JJ You are right. It is wrong to misrepresent a President cause and affect Luvo Makasi 
26:27,28:39, "@Kapn Krunch yes you are wrong All Zuma fault was just saying true @Thando Nkutha you really hate these essays lol Where did Ramaphosa acquire the money to Invest in mining and buy all the McDonald Franchises?? @Pastor JJ I think these are discussions that need to be had. There are few other areas where we SAfns can engage. since Zuma hijacked the country via hijacking the ANC nearly everyone particularly his followers feel bold to copy him @Thando Nkutha you like it short and sweet 
28:42,31:39, These essays murders our eye appetite😋😋😋 "PP vs CR is likely to be very interesting CR was no 2 in the ANC Collective.....All ANC office bearers are on trail in this commision @Pastor JJ I would argue they are largely essential debates. I like hearing the views of other SAfns of the issues confronting us. this leader of evidence also ...seems to be in need of guidance too Leader of evidence is annoying. Is she a qualified lawyer? if it was Ms hofmeyer shes just sharp ukuthi... Is it gonna be a full day? Buthelezi is for half days testimony. this one is not applying any analysis 
31:48,33:14, from the 9-15 is zuma I don’t worry that much about PP’s findings negative or not negative we will deal with it no problem It's interesting to learn that Madam Myeni was also the Chairperson of Fly Chefs . Where she would have profited no doubt. very difficult to follow at what stage we are in this testimony.....we are being robbed of entertainkment "@Pastor JJ You know where the block button is - if you don't like seeing what I'm saying All other leaders are working on 🚿Zuma emails Next SABC Ms Myeni is a mastermind or KINGPIN or architect with no signature ... @makhosi nobhatyi Depends whether money laundering is involved and the extent of it. 
34:17,35:57, I miss Maleka and Norman tjooo! you cannot pay a third party... Shes not guilty because she did not sign any thing and everything at this point are but just allegations @makhosi nobhatyi when? "@Dominic Przybylski there was no money laundering there saa made a fundamental error paying a third party. @makhosi nobhatyi I hope so. If CR is proved to be a crook we are in huge trouble. @Jayden Bango we are waiting this weekend or next weekend @Pastor JJ Like I said - block me. 
35:59,39:00, @Wilson Hishono Dudu Myeni was not pulling the strings. I think the Guptas were and Zuma was using Dudu (his concubine ) as an enforcer. It is scary when you see how people were bullied into stuff. SAA made a fundamental error appointing Madam Myeni @makhosi nobhatyi cant wait for hlaudi and faith "Pastor JJ @Dominic Przybylski you need to understand she enters political space so she is serving particular faction "Zuma appointed Myeni @Born free Yes thanks @Dominique.. I was wondering about that. Malema reprimanded SA in 2011 about the Guptas and the apoointment of ministers @Dominic Przybylski @makhosi nobhatyi Sadly I think CR is not clean and as such JGZ will ensure he is unmasked so they all go down. I think we will soon be looking a new Prezza. 
39:15,41:38, "@makhosi nobhatyi regardless of faction if the evidence of fraud Zuma mentioning names? No sane person will believe a word he says @Disemi Molta I think JZ will find some excuse not to testify. "Money laundering does not form part of PP. iT IS A SEROUS CRIME Cadre deployment and BEE has virtually guaranteed that anyone involved will have acted without integrity. Has the Government had to bail out SAA almost every year since Myeni was appointed?? Oh really uThuli yiDiva @ Norman Zwane that won’t happen if it doesn’t there will no more ANC I promise you South Africa need a lead like CR but no space to operate because of the faction and Zuma 
41:49,42:31, mhhhhhh!!! Guys when is JZ testifying? "Preach mama Mpshe 15 to 19 july 15th to 19th July Suicide would be my top reason for 🚿Zuma no show @Disemi Molta JGZ has already said he will pick and choose which questions he will answer. i think he will do his best to discredit the Commission and bog it down.He said this to students at UJ 27/6 @Le MbembinO aint gonna happen So they could not have had their first gets on the pulse.. we know why now. 
42:47,44:46, Thank You guys "but he must be treated like others What a lovely blazer there is no way zuma can duck all the evidence that is pointing to him Zuma will have to answer questions and not pick and choose. Judge Zondo will ensure this. maybe at the end we can have a clean governance "@makhosi nobhatyi I think the JGZ faction (Ace OUTA must also vome come 
44:56,48:02, I suspect so "Zuma is no longer the President and must be trated as such @Thando Nkutha I don't dispute he will go to commission but his lawyer will do all the talking. He'll find a way not to testify. "I took that plane twice from and to Dakar in Senegal "If Zuma is not careful enough Nkandla will be forfeited by the state @ Norman Zwane you know crooks what they are doing trying intermediary CR in fighting this corruption but our president is smarter he is corporate until final they don’t have anything other than thi I knew someone who said there was an African buying up cars to ship to africa. This was in mid 2000’s Interesting she said that. speak up buthelezi man 
48:03,50:49, "The last time I went to Abidjan in Ivory Coast I took the SAA flight via Accra I dint fly SAA anymore With all of these chaos & shambolic in such very important not just organ but symbol of the nation where was the NIA to alarm & advice the government and parliament? One day they will fight amongst themselves over the money they steal from us See her infinity symbol on her blazer? is that a pin? or pattern? SAA is a scary airline. youtube has become propaganda mainstream media news If 🚿Zuma brings all the family the courts not big enough this commission should remove adv buthelezi .... perhaps special leave of some sorts . 
50:52,53:06, Now they are after Gordhan whom not stealing money and leave the corrupt comrade Problem with JZ is he doesn't understand difference between corruption and integrity. @Mike Meyer i second that. its just painful the way she is leading "I read that people are collecting money for Zuma supporters are coming to the commission @Mike Meyer How do you expect people to learn/gain experience? @Francois Cape Town other platforms not here. They even asked taxi associations to lower their fares for his supporters to attend @Francois Cape Town this is not a training ground. "Mike Meyer 
53:20,55:14, @Thando Nkutha you give her too much praise not on a forum like this @francois "Magda Seguin It's just that Ms Buthelezi does have this cry in her voice.. 🤣 "@Jayden Bango and then somebody on another platform complaining. You think Adv Hofmeyr was fluent in the start of her career? Give everyone a chance looooool @Pastor JJ No problem. I'll try to stick to the script but it's difficult. 😎 USEMNCINCI LOMNTANA FOR LENTO BAMFAKA KUYO OOTAT'UZONDO! @Dominic Przybylski Exposure is training ground. We only learn through making mistakes 
55:24,57:34, Carl Niehaus.....happens to be a bitter and twisted Commie.. "@Kay Kay he is a discredited ANC cadre @Dominic Przybylski JZ wouldn't know integrity if it jumped up and slapped him in the face. @Francois Cape Town the other able advocates did not get their experience here. she must get that from the courts before she exposes herself to this. its substandard Carl Niehaus...happens to be a bitter and twisted Commie...... "Born Free Sometimes when Ms Buthelezi asks a question it is as if she is going to start crying 😂 looooooool @Jayden Bango SHE'S STILL THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY 
57:34,59:14, "@Jayden Bango Experience is gained from getting out of a comfort zone @Francois Cape Town not here "Francois Cape Town  This woman is the kind of person who can hold office very honest and sincere "@Jayden Bango Precisely here. This is raw charming and motherly.....who? Yes.. that she is. "@Magda Seguin 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀 
59:51,1:01:26, SHES THE SAME LIKE UBABA LOL "@Lew464 OP had representation by old @Lew464 Stop !! He is guilty I wonder how she acts when cameras off? The True self always gets revealed Zonda really likes her @Jayden Bango So do I... "@Kay Kay Yes IILADIES ZIMLINDILE - SHE CANT WAIT TO GET DONE WITH THIS CRAP thank u 
1:01:51,1:06:20, "OP Thuli Mpshe has been so clear and hardly checked any notes. 1st class truthful Has Meyer appeared before the commission yet? She has a perfect memory But Agrizzi was recorded in his own home and that recording should not have been admissible in this enquiry or a court. "This lady seem to be legit "@clive oconnell she's just enjoying herself "Thuli Mpshe stood up on her ground "@Magda Seguin 
1:06:36,1:07:40, "When she said this morning that Dudu Miyeni said about Bosque that ""we will find something to get rid of him"" I knew this witness was on a roll" @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU That's because she is not a looter. Very impressive witness. Let's see the accused try to cross-examine her. This witness is credible and ethical. They will always do this to you because all of them are theive you are not like them keep up your integrity outstand waman you are and example Zondo has to take over from Buthelezi. @Kay Kay remember they wanted NDZ to be president? Take a guess why "@Dominic Przybylski Oh thanks. I thought she's part of the looting gang crew. But i was like @kay kay they want to put someone who is not going to chase them with the stolen money 
1:08:19,1:10:47, University @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU she must have been a very smart girl in her early years... noba umbambe red-handed she would talk you out and end up believing it was not her "@Derek Main I felt so as i started to watch this few minutes ago. She's not what is called in the legal profession Miss Buthelezi🤐🤐🤐 Head of Human Resources is a very important job. They need to be a moral honorable and Not Bias at all @KQ Proud American Woman An American here? Are you spying on our matters? @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU aphinde abesi slender nogal.... peeew! @Siya Dilimeni 😂😂😂 With such credible witnesses how is JZ going to dodge the bullets??? 
1:11:50,1:12:41, "You know the game @Siya Dilimeni .. Jeez "@Mark Kidd He'll say ""Apartheid made me do it.""" @Yolo More looooooooool "I think Dudu Miyeni only has a Senior Education diploma  That weave hair or bun on top of Ms Buthelezi's head.. looks very heavy Top heavy "@makhosi nobhatyi @Keith What? Only a spy mentality would think that way. If i’m wrong about your question My apology 🤝 30% + BEE Licence for stealing even more. 🚿 
1:12:51,1:14:59, is dudu coming to face zondo @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Khuzeka - soft on her ? Wena? "@KQ Proud American Woman ""No collusion!!""" They were trying their luck. BTW an open free society right? This is on Youtube Exactly No Collusion @KEITH 👍 spam @ kay kay they want NDZ so that they can do whatever they want that’s why they rush to put people in the parliament all out war in he anc 
1:15:04,1:16:33, Mzandile masina Zuma faction activists "@Norman Zwane Slanders mate LOL people fighting to stay out of jail Miss Myeni haha buthelezi does have a pretty smile though They practiced with BNP and Koroneka then scaled it up. RET! Then they needed idiots in positions. QED. Masina ANC will be collateral damage 
1:16:38,1:17:52, Oh gosh...where is Ms September? This sub-chair is making jokes now 😞😞 "@makhosi nobhatyi Masina was going to resign & not serve under CR 10 billion eaten @Kevin Allister Simon that Koroneka aunty need to come back she was not convincing. i think she duped us "Love Ms September @Kevin Allister Simon That's the pattern in BEE - give contract to clueless token then launder the money into their own accounts. for BEE DEALS A third of the GDP: R1.4 trillion 
1:17:56,1:20:51, *sigh* Adv Buthelezi... USIS'THULI KUDALA WAHAMB That doesn't sound right.. not made into law then it is unlawful. Zuma dumbest President ever It could even be more looted judging by the new AG Report that only 18 out of 297 municipalities had clean audits "@Jayden Bango aunty Tlatsana was a fake business person who I think learned how easily one can be used once you are given a iPhone she looks scared To count 10 billion at R1 per second will take 360 years. @Norman Zwane she was hiding behing a fingure When 🚿Zuma speaks ANC click their heels and start dancing. Law means nothing 
1:21:23,1:23:23, This 30%set aside whatever it is.. is invalid and should nullify any contracts. @Jayden Bango Hfigure was not bad either Dez lama Deza!! Black agenda i see here The two she mentioned are also implicated @Born Free Too right ASAP she thought he was white haha Like yesterday WoW!! policies and procedures are not important All Zuma people 
1:24:14,1:25:04, Wow! No wonder we have such competent employees in SOEs.[not] Des van rooyn! State Capture had become State Policy. Des Van Rooyen was a backbencher in parliament when Zula appointed him Minister of Finance YI LEGEND UTHULI Weeekend Special 💣MK veterans 💸💸 😂 MK veterans I see Well said @Kevin Allister Simon 
1:25:07,1:28:00, The radical economic transformers (the problem with zuma and his people was that they sought corrupt ways to introduce radical economic transformation. It only benefited them.. mxm) Des Van Ruin! Get Carl Niehaus in as well. "I saw those veterans at the Zuma meeting with the ANCYL at UJ a few days ago "Des van Rooyen. "" aka"" the weekend minister 😂😂😂😂" Hey Ms Myeni was at another level and no one could stop her.I wonder whether they have ever read the King's report on governance. "Carl Niehaus ""stepped down as ANC spokesman in February 2009 after admitting to maladministration of his own finances I like this woman. Very wise it seems. Well educated how did this Kwinana lady become a CA 
1:28:07,1:30:23, dont need BEE with people like her me too "@Magda Seguin we have a huge problem here @Michael Wild exactly. "@Jayden Bango cut and paste qualifications I employ on skill and qualifications not into BEE. @Felix Muyoba my heart bleeds A corrupt CA The CA and Myeni must go down together. 
1:30:58,1:32:33, @Born free You employ Zimbabweans ? "Also looks that the BEEE was cooked BEE is just a vehicle for corruption. "Born Again I employ skilled qualified people All BEE DEALS ARE COOKED myeni is zuma gf I have a problem with Zuma who seems as champion of implementing ANC resolutions now but he failed when he was a president now he is an expert 😳😳 I pray people turn around and defend right I don't need the government for business and it won't dictate to me. 
1:33:35,1:36:57, 🏅🏅🏅 They get 30% of revenue without having to do any of the work. I know my dad's architectural firm had to pay 40% to black partners who did nothing in order to get government work. Economy can't survive Are those Black owned company qualified? Or just because they are black only? That’s bias in my very humble opinion. When only for skin color or female only is the wrong way for success "Magda Seguin "All thanks to Mcebisi Jonas Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture will be followed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission then All Case Closed. "@Kay Kay His speech as IJ can be considered inciting a revolt Ja @Siya The CA and Myeni must be charged for the role they played in collapsing SAA.They deserve very long jail terms 
1:37:18,1:41:08, @Yolo More I tell you My hope is that BEE is proved to be a vehicle for corruption and state failure by this commission and that it will be scrapped. "I dont think so @Siya Dilimeni Magda. send utube link please. @Dominic so many businesses people are immigrating due to BEE We are digging this whole to get to the rock bottom only cover it again "Haven’t heard wittiness pleading Chair @Magda Seguin I'm retired now but had to leave the country to continue with my career in IT. "@Dominic Przybylski That's my hope too. BEE is corruption on steroids. However 
1:41:34,1:44:46, Friday before ✈️ @Kevin Allister Simon just search for NPA in the search bar @clive O’Connell that BNP guy was a total idiot. Did you watch his display at the close when he was pleading that what he’d done was in the interest of black people. SAA are busy buying aircraft right NOW. Is anyone watching? or are we going to see on this Zondo channel in 5 years time? "I have hope that SA will get on its feet again but I am so scared of the endemic violence @Magda Seguin Cannot find anything in the last week on youtube but did read article in Daily Maverick on Friday where she says NPA is in much worse shape than she had imagined. "@Magda Seguin Shamila will be riding on the same boat with Mkwebani soon BEE destroyed many businesses that employed many blacks. Group Five and many other engineering firms and other companies. BEE did not create jobs it lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. "Both the women at the NPA have flawless credentials 
1:44:58,1:48:17, This one was sanctioned because she went with the white cabal at SAA It is hot really for Ramaphosa @Born free BEE and AA destroyed the whole SA IT industry because there were not enough qualified blacks to fill the quotas. "So @ Yony Bren I must be a sitting duck to be raped and killed I ain't going anywhere.. my ancestors were here before the Zulus and Bantu. "@tony bren To be honest We were world leaders in IT before BEE. "We all have choices "I can walk safely here at night

Just last night a couple was killed in their own home in the EC "@tony bren ""You guys..."" So you're not from SA?" @tony bren Where do you live? Are you a South African?

Ya`ll act like you were born experts mxm People like Zondo and Miss Mpshe prove that BEE and AA are not necessary. If competent people of any colour are allowed to operate unhindered they will uplift the country. I stand on a point of Order.. what do you you mean Order? @Sthakathi Khumalo well said I have seen many very compitent black women lately. Why are they not in the cabinet President?

I am not sure. 😭my heart went out to Dr Dawa last Friday when he related how he’d lost his house and his inability to gain useful employment. @Gareth Davies He is the biggest Victim in all this nonsense! I miss Buthelezi already Dudu Miyeni is really a nasty somebody MYENI & KWINANA were full of it! @Magda Seguin Mokotedi and Thuli are they pair? 🤔 @Magda Seguin VERY Nasty You mean involved romantically? 
2:28:57,2:34:12, Thuli has a white fiancee Dudu Myeni reminds me of Grace Mugabe.

This is getting exciting. In the horror category @ Moahi Hlapolos. eish "Bullying in the workplace is rife in SA SABC must just dedicate one of thier 5 tv stations to state capture commision data is quite expensive 
2:41:42,2:42:56, Where is the evidence leader?😂😂😂 This is getting out of hand and the chair is enjoying it.😇😇 Now I understand what radical transformation means: It means that government should act without any regard for the law. The Judge is enjoying this Mgossy....

Not everyone can watch some off us are working "Tense is not the word My point is that it is only a politically insignificant minority who will have been exposed to this evidence. chair cannot believe what he is hearing Sometimes I watch the commission videos later on YT that I couldn't watch in full Hoo hooo there are emails😊.

2:54:56,2:57:44, So effectively Kwinane as owner of the company would be getting the 30% and then deciding how much she'll give to the members of her consortium. Pure conflict of interest. @mxolisi buthelezi alikhophuki ibele on this one? unbelievable chair.....but it happened @Siya Dilimeni ungenaphi ebeleni? Bring my cigars before uphawula ngebele la... "Zondo has a tendency to interrupt and mess up confidence of some of the evidence leaders "do understand why we shouldn't rush arresting people "I disagree with you to an extent ORDER @Noluthando Gosa 🙈 
2:58:08,2:59:49, I agree @ Noluthhando Gosa. Thank you @Gareth Davies. I’ve long observed him. He doesn’t do this to male evidence leaders nor Adv Hofmeyer Don’t leave any stone unturned showing the blatant corruption that 🚿Zuma started with his illegal 30% payoff for his brothers and Indians This like mafia. This Ms Mpshe sounds like a problem to work with. Ke tsebinki!!! bring egypt wealth to s.africa @Gosa most of these women evidence leaders are hopeless hence Zondo interjection Noluthando Gasa the chair like competence irrespective of gender and race. he did this to Mhlangu all the time because if his ducking and diving 
2:59:52,3:02:08, belong to us "@mxolisi buthelezi No mahlangu was terrible @Yolo More Our countrymen consider the respect for competence irrespective of gender and race as racist. Exactly @Anne M they cant stand women with integrity and morals @Anne M. she must be cross examined... ke tsebenki too much and boy does this lady have strength of character pity she not in Government Mahlangu is a 💩 who could not remember his lies. @Magda Seguin who are 'they'? hahahaha

There are very few people who don't spell my name wrong :) @Siya Dilimeni 😨 SARS and SABC are still to come. She is spilling the beans. So she and the Dr get sacked who were ethical The president is applying his mind arrests need to happen soon because the longer they wait the more is stolen or evediance hidden. This Miyeni and Khwinani were not even in the struggle. Greedy magogos... 
3:07:45,3:09:38, "Legality Liable ..!! They all are but NPA done nothing @roberto wilco Ethics are a sin to corrupt people. Domenic seems that way. stimple also got sacked. Maybe it is time for Judge Zondo to attach a trauma counselor to his team? They just cannot be left unaffected by all this evil corruption and crime. Last days are indeed upon us! anyone else notice Thulis horns and earnings? ha ha " SAA has just requested another R4bn bail out hahahahaha she is what we need in the corrupt arena 
3:09:49,3:10:49, Zondo's smile on Thuli must be called to order When is the big dog's coming forward stories jerr @Dominic Przybylski. I knew an engineer with the same surname at Rossing UranuIum many years ago. @mxolisi buthelezi After taking over the new aircraft....lol @rosalind gerber what are you referring to? When South Africa cant borrow money what are they gonna do then. the flag and scales on the back drop when she looks straight ahead the scales look like earnings 
3:11:04,3:14:05, "@Gareth Davies I did a three month contract at Rossing Soon as all the farms get taken south africans will start to have a food shortage. "I see the scales  The two common denominators in this criminal conduct are Meyeni and Kwinana. Now up to SAPS/Hawks/NPA/Courts. @roberto wilco go away with that rubbish here. We are discussing SAA... Thanks @rosalind gerber How can all of this happened for years now and no any arrest and persecution for this blatant stupidity? @magda sequin we could give her a halo too? "Ah okay. I don't know any Przybylskis outside of my immediate family 
3:14:06,3:16:07, ls adv buthelezi still in the room... is she an advocate heaven help us @Mike Meyer she's on Whatsapp Definitely @rosalind gerber 🤗 @roberto wilco When all the ANC leaders have farms like Zimbabwe we will all starve 1500 commercial farms now 300 in Zim Thuli cannot be bullied. @Raymond Fitzgerald We don't disrupt or disrespect our elders Clive i reckon they will want the wine farms first 
3:16:08,3:19:53, "SA maize forecast is bad Popsak farms sit a we are in business to get to the bottom of this corruption she is useless @SABC Digital News ? ? Beverly Hills to have a meeting in Umhlanga "The Unions are implicated in state capture as well Unions should be closed agreed so wholeheartedly to save SA unions must go fast. 
3:19:59,3:21:30, "Apart from state capture The tripartite alliance is the worst thing that happened to SA they are a bunch of Commies/Socialists....true "@Magda Sequin @Gareth Davies ...spot on capitalism created unions... Yes absolutely @Gareth Davies You need tripartite 3 so you can all pick each other’s pockets 💰 Commies then hijacked them.... 
3:22:18,3:25:19, Exactly what happened @MIKE LOCK True. Karl Marx didn't forsee the establishment of unions. There were no unions in USSR. Or China Cuba N Korea the commies area very clever SOB's.......we gotto be many steps ahead of them.... Communism is dream sold to the poor while the oligarchs live large "@Mike Lock They tried to downgrade her at work Blame the unions. Was management that fleeced these companies Your President started as union leader 💰💰 
3:26:09,3:29:41, and did nothing to help union members at Marikana. "Yes look what a magnificent billionaire the previous union leader Guarantee nobody will be arrested. Maybe a few whistleblowers thats it Zondo was never ready for Myeni😂😂😂 @MIKE LOCK there us a real strategy in keeping people uneducated hence the 30% pass rate Myeni was planted at SAA ZUPTA is on record as saying that he doesn’t need “clever blacks”. "Miyeno was being obstructionist in dealing with the witness true...sheepal are very easily led...true 
3:30:17,3:32:48, very sad indeed//// What???. and no Union members so Unions are only used when they needed. I'm very afraid for our future...... "Miyeni had no guts to face Thuli true she was probably with ZUMA All against BCEA To my mind.....it's either fight...or flight..... 
3:34:20,3:41:29, typical breakdown of a working relationship Could have been @ Raymond Fitzgerald...the SOE looters were always acting in accordance with Zuma and Gupta orders "Legalitiespolicies and procedures out the window And so institutional knowledge was cast aside to make way for theft whats airline can i use thats not state run internally Hand picking the pliable candidates Nantsi must come back. Vast difference because i dont want to lose my money if the airline goes broke and ive bought tickets 
3:42:07,3:53:24, Job descriptions of an auditor and CFO is a world apart @roberto wilco Safair & Kalulu she sound honest and i believe she is in her Q&A thanks anne Said. Nhantsi was parachuted in onto a burning platform. Perfect candidate. Qualified yet lacking experience. Easily manipulated. Rubber stamped what she was told to. Leaked @Kevin nantsi is clueless does not know a he from a she Language issue only. She knows she's been abused. What this commission is demonstrating is Black excellence as well as Black malfeasance. Interesting contrast. 
3:53:56,3:56:58, "i like the memory of these women Gavin Watson ain't black malfeasance.... DO NOT generalize!!! "Totally "just logged on  a lot SAA. News24 will have a summary "Gavin Watson was in cahoots with 'black excellence' @Mr Q Sorry he must have forgotten ANC is a broad multicultural church And a 'collective' 
3:58:03,4:01:16, she should be reinstated as CEO "When people told me at the dawn of democracy in SA that liberation movements are never successful at government Best to put the airline into liquidation Best to put all the state owned enterprises into liqiodation they are all trading insolvent "The Taxpayers of SA have deep pockets for SAA SAA is a mess. She was trying to stop mess @Neo that race card Neo who has been in government for 25 years "Well! If affirmative action only allowed for black people to be employed 
4:01:25,4:06:31, corruption and greed dont have color.. wake up call it a ppp mr q "@Neo Mongale this lady should be CEO As he will kick bums and turn it around She is very smart and ethical she is tired of all the drama and stress very very smart More overtime for SABC 💸 Gee lets hope the sabc doesnt go broke and we dont get to see this televised 
4:07:03,4:13:27, Its a train wreck but i cant stop watching 👍we need more like her. Just think where we could go as a country led by the Thuli Duo. Yes Gareth What a dynamic leader O "@Anne M News24 is the most trusted news in SA "What about the South Africans sleeping on the streets today @Neo stop it are you listening to yourself There are Americans living in the streets too

4:20:53,4:24:09, its getting late SA women very impressive at this ZONDO. They all top class. @Freddie van Rensburg i disagree. the lady from Koroneka was dodgy "The principal of the matter is @Freddie van Rensburg also the cash in transit one was worse....ms Viljoen The honest SA women. Sorry. Lot of crooked women have appeared. Ours have moved Dubai and Cayman Island 💸💸 "But in true reality shown is that we are a criminal paradise were they even come from overseas to kill they wife’s Kalandra Viljoen was found to be complicit in money laundering 
4:24:11,4:26:22, when will Ramaphosa face his charges of Marikana Sadly....we have become A Mickey mouse country......no one respects us any more.......the world is laughing at us.....very sad @Kwanele Kwanele when Jesus comes "@Clive O’Connell a lot is gonna happen in SA in the next 10 years.. I haven't given up on this country What about Coleman Andrews over 200 million golden handshake @Jayden Bango🤣 Eeeeeeesh...we sure need a couple of miracles...... Zuma said the ANC will rule until Jesus comes 
4:26:56,4:30:03, How convenient hehe I reckon we gonna suffer for many years to come.....the damage has been to great And they will for sure! Because poverty makes people believe in empty promises. True aFreddie Van Rensburg These people are compromising her evidence @MIKE LOCK I don't think a miracle will help us here. I just think we need to appoint someone who will turn the lights off and disconnect the generator. well we frighten EFF @Yolo More Which investigators? "Just on PIC enquiry 
4:30:03,4:33:25, They are also captured "@Alirio De Araujo @Norman Zwane .....let there be light...heheh Ann M the commission's investigators. @Anne M he is talking about the documents that disappeared of Thuli she gave to investigators "@Sthakathi Khumalo I have been following her 🙏 This issue of the investigators is troublesome How come they lose such important documents!!! 
4:33:36,4:38:47, Peoples....reckon the Big Guy in the sky...is gonna do things etc etc........watch an see.... @MIKE LOCK I take it one of the most difficult things in life is to cut your losses and move on. Whilst we have some money maybe we need to move to Zimbabwe. those investigators 🤔🤔 Some documents were not read into record in today’s evidence because of incompetence @Norman Zwane ......we gotto start scheming etc etc Best to get out of South Africa if you can. Zimbabwean cant even get passports and South Africa seems to be following there history. "@MIKE LOCK If I can sell my property to the those who are ANC hopefuls "Norman Zwane That is so true 20 dollars for cereal in zimbabawe and 15 us dollars for a toothbrush 
4:39:47,4:43:17, she went through a heck of a lot Even the crooked women that have appeared have been more sharp than the crooked men. Genuine😁 i am truly shocked at what has been done to these people. and she still stood up to what's right Incompetence!! @Norman Zwane ....I love my country...but....if i gotto go.....i gotto go... "@MIKE LOCK If we pack up first What chances for turnaround strategies and new boards and expensive new CEOs to actually succeed? So this Jarana was not that smart as is portrayed. 
4:43:59,4:46:52, "He had to finally admit that he is not the silver bullet that could turn SAA around @Dominic Przybylski They best be buying a few Quantums and start driving up and down the highways instead of trying to fly.Either that or all of us are up the creek! I don't think anybody can turn SOEs around within the current political context. I think Jarana was also influenced by the rotten apples that is still on the Board Why do you think he left in a hurry? @@Yolo More In seSwati lijaha is a young man but Lijahana is a small small young man- a boy in fact. i am truly impressed with this woman In fact that is what he said in essence in his press release for his reason for resigning They destroyed her 
4:47:08,4:48:58, The competent ethical people regardless of colour are all kicked out to allow for looting. Yes Dom UetvZumas legal fees are still being paid...terrible! @carol berry Just shows the world is missing out by discriminating against women. We have some powerful executives out there in skirts. I'm mighty proud of her. *Yet public sector destroys careers Jarana was captured As far as I know Jarana had no aviation experience. "@roberto wilco They tried Roberto but they failed 
4:48:58,4:50:34, So this is how Jarana handled the turn around strategy katana flew kites They must be compensated @Yolo More @Dominic Przybylski He was parachuted "Death threats jarana flew kites Zondo asking her for advice. Shows her respect Norman Zwane tjerrrr. Do many people loose their lives and their livelihoods and their dignity and the others still roaming the streets spending the money stolen 
4:50:40,4:52:05, "AND one name in today’s testimony will represent parliament important portfolio No he didn't @Dominic This government has lost all legitimacy. @Thembisa Odendaal If I made Jarana a kite he would have it entangled with the street lights power cables. A real lame duck. Even men's clinic would not help him to get it UP We deserve her views. He is brilliant This advocate looks ill She is brilliant @Norman Zwane 🤣🤣 @Norman you have got the diagnosis

4:58:59,5:00:10, Jiba is a gupta crooktoid in our opinion.made from the same cloth as Dudu Myeni We need to change an entire culture. It's almost impossible. Thanks Mrs Mpshe for being brave and standing to the incompetent corrupt board members. @Yolo thank you I did not want to be negative but I felt zero for jiba she's a skelm "I feel zilch for Jiba i am with you magda...serious so what is going to happen to everyone who is implicated in the state capture seriously "I feel her pain
