What happened to Makhosi Khoza? Why are people who stand up always so unpopular and choked by their own party? @Musa Bakiti It seems you are fooled easily.

56:51,59:08, Very clear that the DCJ has already digested the detail of Mcbride's evidence. This evidence is going to lead to many more having to submit their versions. @Ndim Mavuks Then they're idiots too.

1:08:27,1:11:20, Sowetanlive reports that the EFF has been found guilty of unfairly treating one of its staff members. EFF is not a friend of workers 70% of govt tenders goes to white companies Did you just make that up? @Myka'Al Daud .. THATS BECAUSE THEY MOST COMPETENT... PERIOD It's friday he has started smoking already in construction they will hire a white guy because the market feel more secure with a white guy on site it may be racist but it's the market which in essence is the society as a whole blacks need to love their fellow blacks The DA will be punished for having dealt with a stalwart of the liberation struggle Patricia De Lille "@Derek Main Kindly teach me here 
1:11:23,1:13:26, "ANC govt killed workers of Marikana This is more abt him crying than state capture EFF to pay for unfair dismissal of staffer BY BOITUMELO TSHEHLE - 11 April 2019 - 09:20 @Chris Welensky who is crying? it's like a security guard will beat my black friend but wont lay a finger on me because he knows I will create repercussions but he assumes my black friend wont because hes black even though the security guard is black himself The man of the moment do you see the source of this is mentality and we as whites cant fix it for you @Musa Bakiti No - Afrikaners come in all shapes and colours. 
1:13:40,1:16:34, You obviously don't know anything what this commission is about you can easily jump to conclusion @Matthew Adams That's definitely something they know a lot about. @Myka'Al Daud Ahh please get real. Your comments are nonsense. The EFF in the North West has been dealt a blow after it was ordered to pay a former junior staff member 11 months salary for unfair dismissal. Why do you say he is crying...it's derogatory..he has the courage to talk truth to power unlike the looters @Myka'Al Daud Cyril killed poor black people not us rich black people the commission has been so well timed so as to do maximum damage to the ANC. After that they are going for the EFF and then Musi. The whites are coming back... It is exactly this kind of discourse that prevent people from coming forward to testify.Whistleblowers must be respected as they get death threats.A bit of respect please 
1:16:44,1:18:43, The whites have always been here if you open your eyes... The reason the commission is doing maximum damage to the ANC is because it is set up to reveal the truth. The truth hurts. After killing blacks he was promoted to DP of ANC n the cowntry The CCMA this week found that Maggie Klaas' dismissal was procedurally and substantively unfair. "Klaas @Mathew Red Ants are ANC incapacity to govern with integrity I also have huge respect for the brave souls that come to testify. Most commenting here will not have the Guts. this government is about populism they regurgitate what the crowd wants to hear they are not men like madiba who would tell a crowd what they needed to hear "The EFF has been ordered to pay her 11 months salary totalling R102 
1:18:55,1:21:56, @Magda Seguin respect for a murderer? Don't start with me aunti! and that's the big difference between a leader and a con "The way I have been following this commission You are obviously overlooking the evil deeds of apartheid...listen and learn.BTW O am NPT your 'auntie' was madiba a terrorist yes he most definitely was that or his jail time isn't what made him great what made him great was his sentiments no SABC please give us a signal "Madiba was not a terrorist Robert McBride is a freedom fighter the ANC started an armed struggle due to to the systemic and deliberate killing of our people

The ANC tried everything in their power to stop the commission but Thuli was too clever for them. She made sure it would happen. watch a documentary here on YouTube called tainted heroes it's very long but enlightening as to how the ANC came to power and why they are communists @Jack Sparrow i differ Blocked the racist

Derek you seem to have a problem reading please ANC Resolutions "@Musa Bakitiâ€‹ you clearly differ "Stop believing lies "In her testimony at the CCMA Rhamaphosa is being populist at this point they are so exposed there is no other way then to tell people what they want to hear "@Ndim Mavuks I know the ANC are now trying to peddle the lie that they established this commission. They believe that if you tell a lie often enough "ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ you must be right ""comrade"" not communist at all" How are we going to get of racist apartheid apologists in South Africa.Forgiving them didn't work.

That gangster! That proves your low intelligence once and for all. Zuma was elected as president shortly after a rape case that's pretty much all you need to know about him and the ones that elected him as president in the anc "Read Chris @Ndim Mavuks Be honest - the ANC was dragged kicking and screaming to set up the commission. They tried everything to stop it. the same white racist courts that prosecute ransoms for social media posts but do nothing when genocidal calls are aired on the news some fantasy you need to live in to create such garbage criticisms

1:58:20,2:00:33, President Ramaphosa has announced a new board of the SABC regardless of the DA/ EFF objections. The former President of AZAPO Saths Cooper is among those who are appointed. the problem with SA is that qualified candidates dont throw their names into a hat. think how Dikgang moseneke would have been as a president Thank Mr Pretorious your line of leading was making me nervous that you are partial "McBride is known for his leadership of the cell that bombed ""Why Not"" Restaurant and Magoo's Bar in Durban on 14 June 1986 "@These we all know apartheid history...tell us a bit about Vlakplaas McBride is more than competent if you carefully follow his testimony at this commission instead of allowing the yeast of the Bar incident to bubble to the surface @Thelsa Apartheid is clean because it benefited you Will always remain a drunk & a murderer "Ramaphosa doesnâ€™t need any Zuma help right now

Nathi Nhleko was a law unto himself. The gall. Then again he's the same guy who wanted to force a firepool down our throats.
