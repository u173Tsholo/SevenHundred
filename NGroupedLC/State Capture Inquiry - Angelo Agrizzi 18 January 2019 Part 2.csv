10:28,14:44, "Welcome  many are left there..#ENCA "ya "Why do people want to make the chats a volatile environment  enca sound wasn't okay at all Amos molotsi this guy can sing very well "i hope sabc is not censoringand making us miss some of the ""action""...lol 😂🤣😂" "The commission is 'captured"" too via the secretary - how many people are not tainted in this country except me?" what was the media statement regarding secretary? 
14:59,16:17, hayi...that secretary... Hlaudi Hlaudi @Khalid Mather I see he will take leave going on leave ANC ON TRIAL such a mess Take criminal leave? is that like sick leave but South Africa its going to be hard to separate the guilty at this rate Have you ever thought what would happen if Agrizzi says they paid the Chief Justice also? I would pack my bags and leave Sata Afrika 
16:19,19:08, AGRIZZI must sing along Joyous celebration sings very well I want them to slap Dudu Myeni with a mean subpoena 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #Aubrey @aubrey...😮😮 dont jinx the cj...please... "Smith Mara why is Dudu Myeni not arrested She is such a thief :O "I think it would be wise for matrics to consider studying Law dmz...dud myeni zuma 
19:11,21:55, @Aubrey Moloi kikikikiki. and i wi be joining you. "David Cele wonder wat is Lindiwe ""Ginger"" Zulu thinking or saying now cos Malema use to talk abt her in parliament n she defended her" Zumas can't go to jail.. not even for vehicular double murder Ginger doesn't care worse he attaches invoices @david cele Lindiwe is the same whatsapp group as Nomvula/Bathabile. do you guys think zuma and the guptas are watching this.... "Corrupt ANC women 😞  implicated thando 
22:00,25:01, zumas have been enriching ppl for decades.. it will be hard for blacks to give Zuma up @thando wen he or she took leave todae or? "Remember the SIU was done with Bosasa investigation 10 years ago. The file is gathering (or gathered already) dust at the NPA offices If nothing happens after this commission then there’s definitely something wrong with our democracy.🤦🏿‍♂️ "It's time to exposed mayor  The law enforcement is still a joke. They bundled a simple case in the FS - vrede farm. They will not succeed with Bosasa "inquiry commissions are the new jail sentences in SA. someone lays a charge on you it was said earlier this morning dr khotso de wee 
25:06,27:41, ramaphosa function will make deal with zuma function! No one will prosecute Yeah Thando Nkutha VBS from his time at dept of justice I think we need to substitute ANC just for one term nyana. They need to go to gym. the only way to bring down corrupt high profile people is to also implicate yourself I am seeing.. we need to change our constitution. We vote for political parties that elect people to sit in parliament. therefore the party that wins controls parliament. No accountability at all..... @thando what headlines? Ramophosa son come in Remember Zuma saying those who point fingers are also corrupt Ayeye 
27:43,28:57, @Mo P The Anc is arrogant @Mo P I agree with you 100% Aye yeeee Ubaba kaAndile @AubreyMoloi too much. 500 000.00 oh...i thought we had some new juicy info breaking Now ubaba ka Andile must take his son to police station as he mention in parliament. can't wait to hear about Ramaphosa's son. ijo! ijo! 
29:01,32:41, "Dudu Myeni Zuma will be doing alot if heavy breathing and saying ""I donte rememba""" evry1 has smaller nyana skeleton . bathabile master KG inquiry secretary!!!!! to take leave 🤣😂🤣😂🤣 this government feed only old people "Andile Ramaphosa = R500 This must start from the President. @david cele. They are all corrupt. lol no it was a donation "donation  
33:04,34:53, they must close this investigation coz election are around the coner guys kungenjalo Kuzofiwa. Our problem in this country is old people that carry bargage from the past. Let young blood lead you are right aubrey elections will be interesting this time around 🤔 "I think the age of elections are coming to an end age is 3rd or 4th issue... u need to drain the corruption swamp.. "CR said it is a legitimate contract. From what Agrizzi is saying nothing imagine all the hundreds of billions lost by corruption actually went to SA fiscus.. so many people would still be alive 
35:01,37:36, bosasa is just one big cash cow for certain individuals "Remember corruption started with the arms deal "South Africa is a big cash cow for extractivists and mining magnates "Cr left and became a conduit for ANC in business "@aubrey "and his brother in law Patrice Motsephe made his money from dehumanizing mining  "@David Cele ANC is not dead yet "dts true mi brada all of them they mst step down if u cn check they exchange themselve with a top position  its insidious 
38:17,39:38, now they trying to kill activists at Xolobeni :( wired question to dodge whats killing us is the giving of jobs to comrades instead of qualified people weird hlaudi true "it shouldnt matter if you are da or eff Struggle credentials tsa masepa!!! 😞 so sad 
40:05,45:08, very hectic to say the least "They are tired of carrying bags of money via liquor stores. They now want it directly from the Reserve Bank @thando i would not disagree with you on that we need a gupta insider like aggrizi to spill the beans... @Aubrey Moloi Busasa is white owned private company and reserve is white privately owned do what do you mean Gupta's ran away I think its hilarious that an Oppenhaeimer implicates an ANC minister maybe 1 Gupta insider will wake up after this Who is enabling the corruption @IamAman Dempisi . Is it not the ANC requesting bribes? 
45:10,47:29, says alot i hope so andre...i pray ANC are paying the bribes where does Hlaudi fit now😯😯 for favors and SECRECY "the gov has signed a extradition treaty with Dubai SeaArk "@Aubrey Moloi Hlaudi's legal fees were paid for by Bosasa 
47:46,49:46, Hlaudi looking for money to start his pol party IamAman Dempisi​ have you proof "if the ANC cannot manage a simple municipality "cl4hisown​@aubrey "@peter staffen has Ramaphosa's son name not mentioned yet? IamAman Dempisi​ in your statement We will only nationalize during the time of EFF its always said your vote is your voice but after this i wonder if one has signed a deal with the devil. If we vote for other parties what guarantees do we have that it would fair any better🙋 
49:59,52:30, Buyani Masikane​they must close this investigation coz election are around the coner guys kungenjalo Kuzofiwa. EISH THEIR TIMING IS BAD very gud for opposition "@Aubrey and doesn't want to nationalise Reserve Bank Gavin Watson said it is for Andile Ramaphosa Foundation as per whistleblower. CR said Andile had a legitimate contract. Somebody is lying "@buyiswa you are killing us they are killing us "best time possible  all that money could have been used to remove our fellow south africans from informal settlements 
52:46,54:14, and pit latrines the suffering they go through everyday THE ROOT CAUSE IS THE TENDERS. YOOOOO and we must build a border wall too. "no moyani nxt ANC guys Iyophatha kuze kubuye jesu believe me🙌 i am sure comrades are hurting now by this man didnt SARS CHECK any of this

Was it not for his change of heart @thando nkutha wat did they asked about we wnt a young President and minister "South afRICA ke banana republic thanks to the ANC 
59:52,1:03:49, Insane in the membrane "Sure #Aubey Moloi @thando wat was mentioned about CR 17 son Drop them files Agrizzilicious 😛 @Aubrey Moloi 🤞🏾 and it's a hot mess! @Aubrey Moloi DD's change of heart demosnstrate that ANC want to change all wrong done to us. Lets give them a chance. this would be their last round how many last rounds are supposed to give them why dont they take the nation into their confidence and cime clean start afresh...new page
