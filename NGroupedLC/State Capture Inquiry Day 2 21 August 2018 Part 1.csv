47:19,48:51, Maybe a miricle is someone going to jail? There's even a logo üòê "EPG Laws of sowing and reaping will always follow those evil and greedy people who deliberately steal from the poor. Gupta has stolen from the poor. They will pay back . @Thiza William our worst problem is we have a Zombie nations which translates into entitlement.

49:02,51:04, this is not going to put anyone in jail...waste of time! like commissions of inquiries amount to anything! EVER! Stanley....commie mentality.....Commies not welcome in SA "@ Nosiphiwe we fought for this country and sacrifice our youth to be where we're. it's so insulting to listen to a peace time hero puppetry in motion 1. Arms deal inquiry - Millions spent - Zero politicians convicted desensatizing us to the failure of the ANC gov! exactly Akhumizi 3. Life Esidimeni Arbitration - Millions spent- Zero Politician convicted 
51:20,52:33, Tell me any president who's in jail now @ Peter Pot change the nation's thinking mentality and create an entrepreneurial strata which will lead the developmental state that promulgation of legislation after legislation to enrich the nation. @MIKE LOCK You are confusing this South Africa with apartheid that banned certain organisations. Communism and communists is allowed in South Africa. It's a new dawn - commissions that took place in the Zuma era were littered with political interference and unwillingness from politicians to act 4. Eskom Inquiry - Millions spent - Zero Politicians convicted all who are held responsible must jst face the music finix and klaar COMMUNISM FAILS! GULAG CAMPS COMING Ret is communism 
52:34,53:48, Right on Graeme.. Learn from the successful nations than thinking that South Africa is a special case. "No Commission I trust that this inquiry will help us to find closure We ban no political thinking true Lucky "5.

55:41,58:07, "my challenge is one. if we bring the advocate to represent treasury and her husband we fined few mnths ago for heading a bank that was part of currency manipulation i will take this inquiry serious when they Guptas arrive in the country @peter pott Which advocate is that and what would be the problem Where are we going with this testimony of sort.. or he is just layering the grounds for everything to comeüò© Which advocates Akhumzi? "Thinking is free Lol @Lesego Sibiya More of an intro @Sthakathi Khumalo @ Peter Pot what's wrong since his not implying anything but giving standard procedures as define through legislation....to me nothing in a conflict of interest which the judge and his best legal team 
58:25,1:00:04, stupid or less aware than you What a waste of time and money.... Blak N Eazzy Thanks bro.. let me listen carefully as I have just joined welcome "Commissions of inquiries just like the Apartheid TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Commission) are mechanisms used by the Government of the day to ""cool"" down the public and regain confidence in the state" Those jobs were created through the looting of state funds so they were never really jobs in the first place akhumzi! well done Are you going to employ them @thando cezula the case of Nombebe was cleared by all in legal fraternity to be no compromise at all. he benefited nothing as an individual and when the matter of Trillian was exposed the money was returned back 
1:00:06,1:01:43, these idiots dont even know what they are talking about...a whole lot of pontificate over nothing! "Those ""employees"" benefited from gross looting by the Guptas" "@Akhumzi Buthelezi yup...filthy thieves that should be extradighted dusgusting humasn exactly Botlhoko @thando cezula The reason for the removal of that station is not state capture. Send them to China.......see how they then love it... Then you're very ignorant Mzwanele 
1:01:43,1:02:45, State capture is still being dealt with in this commission "why is this guy speaking the white monopoly capital language of English hahahah and nothing will happen "But whatever reason 1. Arms deal inquiry 2. Marikana Inquiry 3. Life Esidimeni arbitrations 4. Eskom inquiry How many convictions did the above yield? Please at the end people must be arrested. I'm just glad it's gone!!! every true south african loves Afrikaans maybe because its english peoples TAX MONEY THAT WAS STOLEN 
1:02:45,1:03:48, Please point to a decision of a court or commision on state capture or looting that led to the fall of that station @thando cezula If you shoplifted a R16 2L cooldrink you would be in the tombs as we speaks. Big crime pays in SA. Nobody goes to prison. can we not entertain racists in this comment section this bantu should speak the ppls Language which is Afrikaans It benefitted from state capture. The money used to start that station was money looted from state coffers! get lost Fils your hateful idiot go travel you have your head in the sand ! DA never loved black people lol Shoplifting is not organised crime 
1:03:51,1:04:46, What ever we say about corruption of black government but the truth is our politician are scared of whites supremecy why do u hate the truth graeme Guys. Don‚Äôt answer Fils. He‚Äôs what keeps us back. Please don‚Äôt entertain him. no one cares dummy Wait wait this 'Boitjie' is about to shoot himself in the foot. DA must be allowed to cross examine. and Eff must also be granted an opportunity "sipho malangu I guess Blak black men are once again showing that they can not run their country effectively...really sad. 
1:04:47,1:05:25, The New Age was also part of the machinery of state capture @peter pott i agree "Thanks Thulani @thando cezula Are you done with pointing out looting in proping up the station? they should speak the ppls Language which is Afrikaans Please don't play the race card here...Bra's thansk Mike tell them losers 
1:05:40,1:07:02, "poloko i agree with you "I must say @thando cezula I am still waiting for a court or commission judgement. Please give me one. please @Fils de l'homme give it a break! Thabiso....spot on man No need for a commission! It's closed qha qwaba and that's all that matters! "onenation Men not women in Africa have tried to run countries but most id not all like in SA were corrupt and dishonest overlords nor leaders. @thando cezula Is that a court or a commission rulling? 
1:07:11,1:08:54, I love South Africa and i believe in our Unity in diversity no more race cards to protect the thieves in the government all humans are susceptible to corruption The banks didn't need a commission or court judgement to close down the accounts of the Gupta-owned companies but they closed them down anyway "Black @thando cezula You are happy that black people have lost their jobs and you can't prove looting "JZ lawyers must be very busy these days; preparing his defense on the Arms deal charges I'm happy that we're taking back our country from thieves and looters who're robbing us blind off our hard earned monies @Akhumzi Buthelezi .... go tell that to Juju and his merry mad men of the EFF 
1:08:54,1:11:15, Akhumzi.....you are the man... we really need to understand how did this happen???? the rules of the game. A few jobs will have to be sacrificed in the pursuit of regaining our rule of law and order! "whilst our eyes are being kept off the ball @thando cezula I hate looting and love black people "@Robert Russell You must understand that politics and politicians objectives is to divide us so that they can rule over us Mzwanele those jobs were never supposed to be in existence in the first place! What crime was found @thando cezula 
1:11:18,1:13:20, arts and education can play a better role to grow south africa better than the greed politicians who only push their agends not for the people they preach to love them while they need the votes You do crime....you do time.... Mzwanele you don't believe looting took place? Tea adjournment people might say its not about race but the whole world is looking at how black people run SA compared to whites and come to their conclusions. kkkkk you sit around if you dont have money for tea Khona what crime was going to be found when the chief looter Jacob Zuma had rendered the Hawks and NPA toothless... Please @thando cezula quickly check the reason for the license not to renewed and you will find that it has nothing to do with looting "Mzwanele owned ANN7 
1:13:29,1:15:41, I understand it has nothing to do with looting! But we all know Multichoice couldn't carry on with a company with so much mud on them And I really don't care what the reason is as long as that Gupta channel has been closed down! yes Yes yes ANN7 protected thieves and vilified those who were trying to do right by this country! "They were planning to control us through their media And yet you are fast asleep. true 
1:15:57,1:17:22, Called brain washing//// Their propaganda was so obvious though! ANN7 would have a panel of 5 people all speaking one language without a single dissenting view who? you@Sybil Stephens lol i never watched it @thando cezula I am glad that you have come to understand that there is no link between looting and the closure of the station. Can't quite decide: is this a cargo cult prayer meeting or the verbal construction of a Potemkin Village? My stolen money! both @David Basckin Mine too... 
1:17:35,1:18:30, ours mine too "Most South Africans are fast asleep I want the Guptas to o to jail but we must not lie. Correct...tax payers etc don't dismiss alternative news media. we will end up seeing only what the puppet masters whish for us to see (MSM). almost there "Yes Our money well some of us do "On behalf of all hard working South Africans 
1:18:31,1:20:01, Only attorneys win in this case. @Sybil Stephens say that again "Nothing wrong with alternative media Look at the world around you. Everything is falling apart. "they talk alot but do nothing cheers @thando cezula "BULLSHIT "How can anyone govern a people do you know the global poverty rate has halved in the last 10 years! 
1:20:32,1:22:09, True @graeme armstong "why i hate Politics: they divide The only way to get SA on track is to use Lycurgus style of governing. (Spartan king) "politics doesnt do that What's your alternative @Akhumzi Buthelezi if you think the government is there ot solve your problems you are wrong Graeme Armstrong where ???? if anything they just make probs "all they should do is protect life

1:42:42,1:44:27, eff is promoting `victim culture` graeme armstrong who is picking race here its accountability stop being cry baby victims I am without fear! Tired of tip toeing around the facts! Only in AFRICA that Liberation parties lead by Black Leaders dont emancipate their people but act as stooges on White Capital to oppress their own ‚Ä¶.is South African political landscape a living testimony of Marx about state being a tool of economic and ruling class who use it to exploit the masses... who does it help! Nothing but a soft bigotry of low expectation to not spe3ak out agianst it! "And again i say what is closure? 
1:44:46,1:46:21, Knowing what went wrong and why if Zuma doesnt go to jail theres no closure for me I agree 100% @Black N Eazzy What happened to the Eskom inquiry? lol let's just wait and see Right on "Zuma took money for pit toilets and gave to one family @Leon Mabiza if you listened instead of trolling you'd know "ya and cyril says it will rake 12 years to get loos

1:47:36,1:48:30, its accpuntabilty and leadership OLIGARCHS "ANC will never investigates WMC lol he was saying i should relax WMC is alos a lie imagine the whole proceedings of state capture just because of Zuma. He must be arrested State capture is an attack on blacks. Why is ABSA not investigated for apartheid money? Mckinseys involvements. seems he needs to relax 
1:48:52,1:49:46, more to come relax @Leon you are seriously brqainwashed WMC is the top 5% that holds 95% of the contrys wealth Life esidemeni! Lets talk about that murder! Zuma only ate 20% of the pie. WMC controls 80% and they loot out country everyday through tax evasions. Everybody knows that. Leon........you confused Bra.......not about race....no race card here Bra this just the brief introduction of procurement Leon Mabiza that has been sorted out long time ago even the PP had to pay the costs WMC made up by guptas to distract from thievery 
1:49:47,1:51:48, waist of time and resources the money is gone Exactly! It not about race but what we do in Government must be done in private The misleading WMC concept.... Those UJ counselors who ate student's money. When is being questioned? Steinhoff? Wake up people! Gupta Bots are here in full force malema is accused of tender irregularities @Leon Mabiza it looks like you are one of the corupt why you work for public office but you need it to be private Reality bots are in full force @Sindiswa Moolman @Mahlasela Kilson What are you saying? 
1:53:02,1:57:09, what i want ot say is the government does not have to have anything to hide as they are working for the public Nothing in government that is not a risk to national security should be private. Right to information held by government is a constitutional right It is embodies in the PAIA Act You can NEVER say that anything is private in government Africa always wins while africans always lose @graeme armstong what are u saying ? must be close to a snack break @ graeme armstrong no one is better
