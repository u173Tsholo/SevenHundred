2:24:05,2:25:45, at least he used his corrupt cash for education unlike some people Smith has hearing problems now At least it's not amnesia "There are no loan agreements here Did you repay the loan?? "when Angelo came back "borrow money at the company dont bring your kids into this "These guys likes loans 
2:26:20,2:27:40, Why didn't you borrow money from the bank. Why loaning from Bossasa? Kanti Smith was friendly with Watson and Agrizzi???? Educated people language.....a bribery is a loan agreement.....stealing money is misuse "your salary can afford school fees So Aggrizzi is registered as a financial services provider since well he`s a loan man is Agrizzi a loan Shark? 😂😂😂😂😂 This sounds like Mokonyane's car story yesterday Advocate Notshe is on the ball I never thought this guy was corrupt remembering when he was chairman of scopa I really liked him 
2:27:51,2:28:27, same story as Nomvula excuse Ask him how much he was earning at the time Notshe. Drag him my Adv Wolf in a sheep skin Why did school fees have to be paid immediately? Where did he get a job for Aggrizzi’s son? How much did borrow I would have loved to see AGRIZZI dance This guy is lying Loan with no interest. Loaned from the bank for my children's fees. No no no 
2:28:27,2:29:06, If its ANC then its definitely corrupt DCJ will come in now.

2:29:26,2:30:43, This is a very difficult question to answer. what were the terms of this loans? Why give Agrizzi your company account instead of your personal account? These people earn more per month than many people earn per year......And they cannot pay their children's school fees......RUBBISH!!!!!! it was like comoufluge yes true that mpete Their kids are studying in the UK These politicians earn a lot of money to go around borrowing money from loan 'shacks' how bribe can turn into loan bathong ntate o 
2:30:44,2:31:40, "Yes favors = bribes I'm sure you could have gone to a bank. which university is this ? Why are @ANC children studying in the UK??? not for Aston Martin "If it was a loan and he doesn't quite know the amount Yho R500000 loan with no interest. Luck Vincent why not loan from the bank or credit card blank check loan.... 
2:31:48,2:32:38, "everything he says is cancelled out  BECAUSE @ANC have messed up our South African universities university abroad when our children here are being taken from pillar to post by NFSAS Kwaze kwamnandi! you borrowed half a million? yhooooo yhooo is he cracking "500k given plus no interest Conflict of interests or possible one.

"look the face now imagine a bank giving a loan on trust. people are getting money out here yoh....... 600k from individual :dothefive: Forget it Smith......You are toast!!!!! 
2:41:38,2:42:13, the bus is coming he going under the bus why not going to the bank Smit is lying. Totally improbable "Did you repay the ""LOAN""" A whole Chairperson of a Portfolio Committee cannot notice a conflict of interest. earlier he said Gavin was his friend not Agrizzi. Are the diapers ready for Smith? @MYLISA NKUNA they're munching strong! His audited loan amount happens to be a convienient exit door/get out of jail card. "That's why they don't approach financial institutions @Lindani Moyo let me go get them 😁 
2:42:17,2:43:05, hahhahahahhahahah This guy is finished Difficult to defend Lies. It's a shame. "@Skosan Just wondering if Mr Smith provided security for the debt. What if he dies @Richard Peffer? Was the person loaning him the money not worried about that? "I waonder if the full amoutnt was mentioned in his audited financials Exactly K. Morule....My point exactly. Why was he borrowing from Agrizzi if the big boss was his friend? pass the buck Nothing untoward about getting a loan from someone working for a corrupt company. It's like these ANC people think we're idiots. 
2:43:08,2:44:23, kickbacks "From an accounting perspective it's incorrect to record a personal study loan transaction as a ""LOAN"" in the company business books!!!!" Y ddnt he borrow from Gavin? And wen dd he start a relationship with agrizzi? The meat is starting to fall of the bones🤭...no point of return for Smitoto! "ok his done now @Lady T yes it must be cold drink money😂😂 @sibusiso mbhele 😂😂😂 They've finally put the real squeeze on him... So it was a Loan for his company if its in the Financials? 
2:44:25,2:45:58, @Derek Govender he keeps referring to the fact that this transaction is recorded in his Company's books....Trying to push the narrative that all is kosher. what was Agrizzis memory of the loan? @Kgotso Mpete trll me when you find a company that offers such kholdrinks please😁! What a smart way to conceal CORRUPTION @carmen but it's an accounting flaw "@Lady T i will definitely tell you @MULISA NKUNA they think we're dumb shem but their lies are catching up with them! "But why does Mr Smith have to keep on borrowing money No interest on a loan of R600 000 over 8 years. Must be nice. 
2:46:16,2:47:11, New book is out “The Rise & fall of the ANC Youth League” should be interesting read @Kgotso Mpete please do because the thirst in this pandemic is real 😂😂! Can anyone in this chat room give me a Smit-Loan?! R500k-nyana?! Y ddnt he borrow from his friend Gavin? Y Agrizzi?

"@Lady T agrizzi needs his money now more than ever PAY BACK THE MONEY @mixdd1 exactly my point @Carmen James... surely someone here has the funds! Lol 🤣 "This guy should write a book too...

Hehehe @Prns Chrmng Chairman of privilege committee. Insider trading. @abc surely he will hv lots of time in prison to do that "What bothers me @Lady T and @Derek Govender 😂😂 All these madalas at this State Capture Enquiry are a big embarassment.... 
2:49:47,2:51:14, Lady T written by Rebone Tau who pulled out of the current youth league task team stealing from the Government is treason against the people of SA. time to hang some. "@Ben Fraser they're in for a long haul because too many skeletons rattling.If they think they'll get away with murder @Solly Tau thanks amd will check out. "carmen "unfortunately no one will be in prison  Always having CASH FLOW PROBLEMS..... Is there anyone in the ANC that isn't corrupt? his cornering himself 
2:51:36,2:52:37, @Antoinette always... I dont trust politicians that are not financially responsible and Agrizzi had all the money Aggrizzi won't ming coming back for a kill again😁.We are behind you Agri if you reading this😛! and how did he buy the shares Chief is hungry Yaass Mr Notshe...drag and flatten him along with his lies. Rural boy is having no time odd with all these assurances of collatoral/ shares and abilities to pay back in 8 yrs that there were no agreements whatso ever. 
2:52:40,2:53:20, They had to cost a little if they would move up to such a bug amount. Angelo must come back @Michael Wild he will come with another fairytale. "Now i get it why S.A doesn't develop true but you can only lie so much let him wear the orange uniform so that he can eat the food from bosasa :dothefive::dothefive::dothefive::dothefive: "This is just a ruse and a complete smoke screen to appease public opinion. Nothing is going to come of it. No accountability wherrrre is katy and leahty 
2:53:45,2:55:50, "Typical Spot on Mulisa @shabangu theres no more money to buy ppe hehehe "@nigel "no point in threatening Agrizzi will end I think they must speak into the mics properly... these guys own mansions and big houses in surbubs where an ordinary person cannot just walk in their streets due to boom gates in their suburs sound is low 
2:55:58,2:57:24, or maybe the old man from last time broke the mics.. So far only Agrizzi is out on 20k bail yet he blew the whistle who on this group has not been to Johannesburg CBD an seen what dump that place is the rest of SA is heading same way guys sound is always a problem "most of these politicians houses are situated in areas of millionaires Maybe this is one of the few who thought of plausable deniability when getting the cash... The most shocking thing is that these corrupt politicians see nothing wrong with their actions. These folks should have used bitcoin. @Muller Pretoria was a beautiful city its no different to jhb cbd now 
2:57:26,2:59:22, if it was me I get the loan for studies but my kid will pay it back in 8 years. So the tough English and preparation of Mr Smit just disappear Yo Joburg is the realness son... if you can make it there you can make it anywhere... a dump indeed "EURO BLITZ 1056 CC is located in KENSINGTON ''@mixdd 1 They feel entitled chair loves his lunch Judge Zondo He really loves his lunch @Malonsta Knight Lol Zondo can't keep away from that cheese sandwich 
2:59:42,3:01:09, These guys needed to use Bitcoin only. :yougotthis:What's for lunch? Nandos "Cheese sandwiches for everybody Not cheese sandwich ..... chicken licken The respect I had for this chap is now gone forever @Mr Green 😁 @a b c heartburn 😬 Yeah I hate cheese... but Zondo probably doesn't lol
