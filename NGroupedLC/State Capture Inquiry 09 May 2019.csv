29:40,32:31, DA Dead on Arrival ANC Leads Are we still here? ANC leads not by example @Misfit Toys Eh? Those are in Goverment in waiting can continue with their WAITING barry white voiceðŸ˜‚ Corruption is cheating. "@Thando Nkutha 
32:47,34:40, who'll call a boy juliass anyway Corruption is with everyone in that PARLIAMENT including CIGARRETS party Yup! DA don't know what they are anymore so voter is bound to lose faith. The results are not yet confirmed We waiting for finals "@Misfit Toys @Thando Nkutha They we more focused on discrediting the ANC than pushing their manifestos sath afrikans have been left with an hobson choice of a lame duck ANC Only 27% of results in. 
35:49,39:48, ANC stole the results Results as 9 this morning: ANC: 55.04% DA: 26.04% EFF: 8.23% FF+: 3.21% IFP: 1.58% ACDP: 1.09% Is this man the Mandela cran? back to the drawing board of a failing Eskom and no service delivery. jip... BOSASA the hawks aided and abbeted the Guptas to escape Nothing is gonna change... that is a promise People chose corruption 
40:32,42:50, "Not going to comment Gangster Ace will become next president soon. Only in South Africa has corruption become a common and acceptable act among the citizens ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜­ @Thando Nkutha yes and now ANC needs o fully rid itself from corruption and focus on burning issues People has spoken respect ANC African National Corruption maby we should consider buying GENERATORS... malema best Joyce 
42:52,47:27, for about 30 years of freedom..nothing has changed just that those in power fill their pockets more and moreðŸ˜§ðŸ˜­ The IEC is suspicious ...how can people be allowed to vote more than once?ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ Big trouble if anybody voted more then once "@Thando Nkutha he cant do it alone better the devil you know thsn the devil you dont know Every instotution is censored by the government ..hence they will never be fairness in SAðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ True ANC though "@Thando Nkutha yep he needs to be more practical than making the right noises with no action 
48:04,57:56, economic free and dom front and backside "We will forever remain stagnant as a country for as long as ANC rules we hope ANC will make change BLF is leading with their arrogant leader "Facing recession in SA will never change "Top 3 parties leading at present:ANC ANC voters are in need of more suffering and abuse "The UEC did a great job "The full results are still a long way off 
58:36,1:20:34, @Misfit Toys dont say things that you cant substantiate "@Misfit Toys thats my point one two one two "@Misfit Toys these are issues of national interest and it carries lots of sensitivity with it "Mr Mamabolo explained that the amount of people voting twice will not impact on the results The IEC has a mechanism in place to trace who voted twice and where.Everyone has been so emotional and paranoid even spreading fake news on Twitter. "Sowetan just published a photo of voters in booths facing a wall "I watched all the IEC press conferences throughout the night KFC for tea 
1:26:21,1:31:26, Majority of SA is demonstrating faith in the ANC Well The ANC had better deliver that faith because this is their final and last chance to do so. "@Val Speirs I agree. If ANC doesnt step up this time I Just want to see people being arrested after results are announced Roger that The wheels of justice must turn and the corrupt must be accountable and punished. People are really finally being educated on what to expect from their votes. "It's a jargo "@Val Speirs Yes. And that's how we'll test CR and team. And also 
1:33:12,1:42:15, morning FF+ surprisingly getting lots of votes... land issue working to it's advantage Yes C R will have to be very Sulligent and selective choosing ministers with integrity and intelligence. dilligent The ANC will have to govern with transparency in that all Government entities must publish the financial aspects costs and procurementsabd Audits for the public to see. elections have humbled some yerrrrðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ All i need to know is who will go to jail soon No-one should be a President or a minister or public servant where there may be a conflict of interest. "jacos 
1:43:12,1:51:51, "jacobs "@Thando Nkutha When you vote for a party that made ""mistakes"" South African's are very conscious about their votes What happened to the EFF?is it that EFF followers are not voters @Thando Nkutha Exactly. And thats one of the many factors that are giving ppl faith in the ANC once more let's resume as in now... "@charu rangka EFF has as much followers as voters You reckon ANC will strengthen significantly after this? "@Thando Nkutha My blood is black 
1:52:58,2:02:28, "I'm just looking at things objectively. And indeed EFF is growing. But as things stands Can't wait for the video feed to resume... "@Thando Nkutha Oh i get you. Yes "my blood is black @Thando Nkutha in what way? Africans will never change i weep for africa.we tend to value corrupt people and look for a reason to stand against the one that stands for the truth No sound! "@Thando Nkutha He says all the right things The ideas of cyril will be the ideas of anc periods he has no say of his own 
2:04:12,2:10:31, Thesame party will produce thesame people "@charu rangka True. But the advantage of State Pres is that he chooses his ministers "u can say anything "@Thando Nkutha haha. 1 that switched me off Juju is when he pushes the Land agenda "In other words And who do you think he will choose as a minister?do u think it will be an outsider? it will still be part of his crew am not SA but an african somewhere "@charu rangka I believe that ppl that CR will choose Our Professional community is corrupt to core "Like the Zwane's 
2:11:23,2:18:34, That is ur blv but ones beaten twice shy cyril belongs to d anc he can never be dff "Mr Ramaphosa  I just weep 4 africa politics "@charu rangka Lets wait and see. Only time will tell. But the fact is Who is today's witness? "@makhosi nobhatyi Well said. We like to complain too much. We get a Pres with Standard 2 Transnet Executive Peter Volmink Hopefully the EFF supporters have seen through Julius Malena and his hoodlum party. The supporters are the party lol 
2:18:58,2:23:49, Thank you @nicky abrahams "If the ANC do not deliver on its manifesto rather march to the Presidents house How are they winning with this happening too? "@The Truth the reason we complain is because yes "Some opportunistic individuals see opportunities to come between our grievances from the ground uses us to get ANC after failing to deliver What ? What are you talking about? The opposition been fighting.. are the elections rigged thatâ€™s that question @rohan barnard He didnt publicly stand up because he didnt want to ruin the chances of taking over and fixing the mess. ABC's of politics I don't think any amount of rigging would make the difference. "@Jessica Francis No 
2:24:54,2:30:30, "@Rohan barnard CR was a not going to make impact alone where Jz surrounded by his cronies "After Nkandla  Aficans are not politicians they are people in business with conflicts of interest and serve their own interests. "@makhosi nobhatyi but he never was alone. Did JZ really have that much power over the people? Look at everyone testifying here Last chance for the ANC. "@Thando Nkutha there could be more reasons to it @Val Speirs Certainly does feel like the last chance for ANC. CR has his work cut out for him. Winning was the easy part "@Rohan Barnard there is wc and NEC which is lot of his support are It's due to scarcity of resources that make Africans mostly to look up to politics as a quick source to aquire easy wealth. Our natural resources are being given to the highest bidders as investment. 
2:30:44,2:36:41, Yes. South Africans will not tolerate any more corruption. "@rohan barnard Believe me "Vote counting @ 34% "DA "I really hope CR runs this country as the business it is. I am going to be extremely honest "@rohan barnard Thats going to be the test for CR Bathabile Dlamini... She has done nothing but cause chaos with the SASSA debacle The DA needs more power punch and a clear manifest. "@Thando Nkutha The reason there's 1 face on the ballot 
2:37:07,2:41:11, "Mmusi failed to rule on de lile matter he admitted that *face aka person Aunty de lile "We need honest "DA lost some to FF+ Race should not be the criteria. A party can have people of colour that represents what South Africa is.. known as democracy. "Looting and corruption is eminent ANC is represents for all understanding Julius malema fighter for the country to be economic impowerment 
2:43:14,2:51:12, "@Thando Nkutha Nope "I'm 29 Julius Malema wants to nationalise all private entities.. that would be the absolute ruin for SA. look at SOEs they have looted all the money and brought SA to her knees . "@ Thando Nkutha Is he a director or manager "@Thando Nkutha Some of ""the ppl"" you refer to Volmink "As for the disbandment @Fuad Abrahams manager 
2:52:32,2:59:03, "CR was the only hope to bring back dignity and correct those mistakes were happening for the past 9 years "@makhosi nobhatyi Absolutely yes this is true about ND Zuma she was captured. "Cyril will only have an upper hand if ANC gets +60% votes. Thats the only power he'll have to fight JZ\ND factions currently within "@ Thando Nkutha ....... Women must kicked Bathabile out of executive Many sections and organizations had\have faith in CR. Let's just continue to pray for him not to dissapoint "john  
2:59:20,3:02:46, @makhosi nobhatyi Who do you think should represent women after Bathabz Congratulate comrade president matamela cyril ramaphosa victory is certain "Yes What about Mme Thandi Modise? "State Capture inquiry represent the ANC lifestyle Let me go and eat my banana "@ The Truth there are many women who is capable to lead the movement True. Politics of individuals within the movement is a dangerous thing ZumaðŸ¤— 
3:03:17,3:06:02, who won? they still counting votes but it looks like anc will win again even after telkom eskom the guptas and all the rest Let me switch the Eskom thank You "@anthony gray Daubern No one yet Cyril still has problems half of his party hold him down #Kapn Krunch unlike hf verwoerd who killed our peoples eskom and telkom are companies pw botha was a killing machines ok 1..............EFF............1..........EFF......................1..........EFF..... so no hes not the best choice as a result of association "@Thando Nkutha Absolutely. Out of those three 
3:06:13,3:08:40, two wrongs dont make a right buddy Malema Juju my EFF 89.9% I predict.......Deal is R1000 "The Truth I am a born free who wasnt even alive at that time so I cant say if your statement is even true #Kapn Krunch we must look back to 1948 when apartheid was implemented your parents should had stood up and speak that black life matter ok Malema JUJU 89.9% predictions "@makhosi nobhatyi JZ was in a corner. He knew he had neutralized the NEC in 1948 my parents weren't even born yet and my entire family was in England Hai Mmusi must call the bus owner to come drive it himself now haha 
3:08:41,3:12:18, stop living in the past its pathetic you never went through that struggle #Kapn Krunch we will always vote anc until we are no longer growers of sugarcane we must act as producers of sugars and learn mathematics unlike verwoerd who did allow us because of the colour of my "@Epica S Epica S Are you awake yet? We voted yday. EFF is at 8.9% now kapn My grandparents where killed during apartheid should i forget that. vote ANC but dont cry to us when our tax money doesnt reach the people that's on you sunnyboy There were certainly South African whites who were apposed to apartheid and joined the movement against apartheid. People who have never suffered tell us Blacks to move on that's pathetic #Kapn Krunch why should i cry to you this is my land that you are residing in it was taken by your parents in 1913 the land act of 1913 
3:12:45,3:15:12, "@Andrew Mboweni as a born free myself no it's not your land go look at history "I was raised in the right way these people cut off their nose to spit their face "My only skepticism with CR Benni Tandi my sincere sympathy but who were your grandparents killed by the terrorists or who?? #Kapn Krunch i am very angry if you have to blame black leadership barack obama was a leader but because he was black he was not respected the problem is the colour of his skin he was black @Kapn Krunch you are spewing nonsense here. The land also doesn't belong to whites either. Go read your history go on walk around like a victim all your life see where that gets you 
3:15:33,3:18:27, Barack Obama was the best thing that could've happened to America. Trump is undoing all his great work We know during the war years that the terrorists killed many of their own people and intimidated them. "I don't hate white people this platform is for building south africa for the better looking into the leadership africa want and we cant keep learning from the white colour we too are leaders and we as blacks matters Barack obama the man who destabilized Libya causing the migrant crisis the same man who tried to invade syria "@Thando Nkutha And he's family wuld be any better to what the Guptas were to JZ. CR needs to pay attention to this Barack Obama was the worst US president ever not because he is a coloured man but because of his policies and the trillions identity he contributed to National Treasury. He was selected not elected. the same man who will be locked up on the spot in several countries for war crimes namely drone bombing of innocent civilians Barack Obama is better than Trump 
3:18:32,3:20:54, Of course black lives matter and their must be progress in this regard. #Kapn Krunch let me teach you history of south africa SANNC it was the umbrella that was founded to protect a black life by pixley ka isaka seme when your ancestors were enjoying life in my land Andrew MboweniâœŒ I learned all about the history of south africa after I left school the anc was funded by the communist party that's why we are selling all our mines to China and russia the same reason we were the only country who bought Brazil's meat that was riddled with listeriosis which no other country would buy because they helped us in the struggle Obama incurred trillions in US dollars if debt to National treasury which President Trump has inherited and has to fix. Kamp KrunchâœŠ "#Kapn Krunch your ancestors took everything from my ancestors and left me with nothing expose me suffering and separated me to alexandra  "The day there will be peace in this country is the day  
3:22:00,3:26:13, Stop the hate speech in order to move forward you must look forward. the age of conquest is over @Elmarie Rorke Say that again please! The day.... we are all free now we all have equal rights now I didnt inherent land I have to work for it and pay off my own property over a 15 year period like everyone else "@Kapn Krunch we are all free look you cannot undo the past. Must move forward. the reason south africa is so unequal is because the schools here in the suburbs work and the schools there in the kasi never see the tax payer money that is meant for them I dont live in sandton but many of my black friends I grew up with do 
3:26:31,3:30:36, "The only day we will move on and look forward @Val Speirs You say that as an absolute done deal or are you leaving room to attempt to correct it? Because its stolen very simple explanation #Kapn Krunch this system which we are trying to destroy started in 1948 by verwoerd who was killed by dimitru tsavendas because of his system you are trying to destroy a system that doesnt exist anymore by voting for and enabling corruption? figures @The Truth Could never have said it better. Must we need to plead? Why is that not obvious? systemic racism in south africa has a name it's called bee that's what systemic racism actually is "@Thando Nkutha @The Truth I find like I hear both of you but your approaches are different government dont create jobs people who have jobs and pay taxes create government 
3:31:12,3:32:23, entrepreneurs create jobs @Normane Zwane.. what must I correct? I was not part of the apartheid . why should white be better on management than us why should all the black leaders be blamed why should a white man blame us why why why what is better about being white that i cannot be rubbish "It's 2019 @Kapn Krunch we are tired of those songs..we know that.. I am now 27 and I have never experienced apartheid in my entire life yet I'm still paying for it that's the only injustice "@Kapn Krunch can only descrobe this as willfull ignorance. i think most will agree that 66% It's not about race it is about merit. Eff second biggest party in RSA 
3:33:03,3:37:01, "@Val Speirs I give up. I concede you were not there the only way to help our people is to stop corruption and make sure our rural and township schools get the proper funding to educate our people "@Norman Zwane @Thando Nkutha It's ppl such as these Nazi's making nonsense here #Kapn Krunch you cannot teach me about government we have a black government that is teaching you how to treat south african who live in it why should white life matters than ours we are leaders *racialize the only thing our government is teaching us is that corruption can be ignored if you convince people everything is racial "#Kapn Krunch you must stop your nonsense we are busy building a better south africa and you are busy talking nonsense as your are the heir or beneficiary from your racist parents I am speaking the truth it's not my fault you cant handle it @Kapn Krunch You are incapable of speaking the truth 
3:37:25,3:39:21, you who calls everyone racist is just achieving the dilution of the word till it means nothing and losses its effectiveness "south africa belong to all who live in it blacks and whites enshrined in the constitution by president nelson mandela because botha  you dont have the back bone to hear it "@Kapn Krunch First deal with the lie you're living you would rather tip toe through the tulips what lie am I living explain "@Thando Nkutha Unfortunately we seem to be dealing with people who are bent on abusing the 'peaceful' transformation and treating us as cowards for that that's right you can't elaborate because you are mind numbingly thick @Thando Nkutha do if I was a black person I would be offended if I need a quota system to be employed. 
3:39:51,3:43:21, "by working for the advantaged and spending on the disadvantaged @Christian W but that strategy (quota system) was there during apartheid..not all whites were educated.. us the rainbow nation the 10% who got to go to decent schools with the right amount of integration can talk about these things all day long because we arent stuck in a past we didnt experience @Kapn Krunch read history and politics ensure you understand why fidel castro learned his support to south africa in the struggle against apartheid as it was very punishable "@Thando NkuthaThe peaceful route was a choice we were all forced into.I believe it was the best option. We are ridiculed for it nonetheless Jacobs showing his face only because the ANC have won. Last chance Jacob but you belong in jail. "@Kapn Krunch The lie you live is u know that the white minority r mostly advantaged "@Kapn Krunch The lie you live is that you choose to ignore how black ppl suffered and the hands of your ancestors cyril ramaphosa is a great leader and a tested leader that even white failed to produce within themselves we voted him and he is here to lead south africa we mandated him we south africans 
3:43:45,3:45:53, @Val Speirs lies disillusioned about this fact it's true Felix. "@Kapn Krunch So based on those 2 lies @Thando Nkutha It pains me everyday I read the white Jingoism in the social media as I cannot understand why they keep stoking the fires of racial hate. I fear how they push people to the Malema camp @Val Speirs nonsense did you have a domestic worker or gardener until you came settle here and became a master over us bloody stupid "@Val Speirs it is not true Africans were tribes living in mud huts and wearing animal skins and loin cloths when settlers arrived. Read the history books. "The Truth  
3:46:06,3:47:19, bigger then these two problems that I dont dispute is the victim mentality populism has given to people telling them to sit back because it's their turn to benefit that lie does alot of damage @Val Speirs why did you leave your continent (europe) to come disturb us here? guys my screen is blank is there anything wrong? this government is populist tells people what they want to here madiba told people what they needed to hear "education was the system used by your ancestors to invent robbery and humiliate my ancestors in the name of education  It was the white settlers that implemented farm schools and education "@Lew464 Yes "@Andrew Mboweni hey 
3:49:08,3:51:27, the government of the day is led by blacks under the capable leadership of cyril ramaphosa the peoples leaders not verwoerd and stridjom or malan or botha or de klerk who understand life in its full "Val You sound like you haven't heard anything @Thando Nkutha I always want to forgive Mandela as there was no map given him. Whoever had taken the first step was going to struggle. It is a done deed though and YOU nd I owe our kids. It was white settlers that designed infrastructure and built it ..yes with black labour. This is all part of history. "The Truth  Education started with European settlers. @Val Speirs education was there only that it was not documented but even then paintings on the rocks were enough..if you ancestors couldnt have come we could have evolved more..so?\ Whites were the first black civilization @Val Speirs yes we will get our free education so prepare yourself to pack up and follow theresa may or donald trump here there is no space of racist descedants of verwoerd or botha 
3:51:31,3:54:11, "@Kapn Krunch The ""victim mentally"" is revived by ppl who continue saying ""forget the past @Val Speirs even if jan van rieebeck could have come we could evolve in a different way and get industrialized.. if whites did not come the blacks would NOT have evolved at all. @Lew464 no man @Val Speirs BLOODY RACIST APARTHEID FOLLOWER USELESS so a lie is emboldened by people being unable to stomach the truth how pathetic is that No I am not a racist at all just talking facts.. historical facts. "@Kapn Krunch It's like telling a rape victim 2 jst move on with life #Val Speirs this is my country and i know you are filthy rich from our minerals and you see us less superior this is our father s land bloody useless education of apartheid nonsense 
3:54:14,3:56:41, perhaps its time to step cottling people so they will become strong @Val Speirs historical facts my foot! I am not an apartheid follower just a historian. @Val Speirs Historical Facts please go read up on Mansa Khan Musa "@Thando Nkutha His humility before his comrades was wisdom which doesnt make much sense I know "Andrew Mboweni  @Lew464 our forefathers had all minerals before Jan came here "@Val Speirs jan van riebeeck arrived at the cape in 1652 with his wife maria de la quellerie and troubled my peoples at the cape because of this colour superiority

3:59:03,4:01:16, @lew your people came to steal it from here @feli muyoba.. @Val Speirs Europe was in the dark ages when africa was thriving like de beers and opperheimer family who were milking blacks to entertain you this is the time of black leadership and we will defend them in all expense unlike my parents who lived to serve you "@Thando Nkutha Tru bru there was that. I hope his hope on Cyril was not misplaced. The ANC I hope gives him the space to unfold and play his hand "With over 85% of votes counted in the Northern Cape the DA has failed to wrestle that province from the ANC.
