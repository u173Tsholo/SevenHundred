"@Lorna Kavanagh aii this white arrogance @Mosimanegape Bapo why do bantus in SA have such an issue with caucasians? "Fils de l'homme

1:02:52,1:05:27, "I hope this commission gets to the bottom of this "@ Norma Zwane; I have read the terms of reference and they really circulate around the former president and the Gupta family @Peet Venter you must go to the europ police station liberation comes with education so thats where the starting line should be @jenelle chetty land I just saw Peniaza Lizufi talk crap on TV Zwane is a gupta stogie Zondo is a dagga smoking judge yes but education is fundamental for the future 
1:05:28,1:07:31, These Bantus have a romantic connection with racialism Zondo need to be investigated he is a confilicted man @Mosimanegape Bapo do Bantus have high IQs? @Kingsley Mathe is your view that there was no corruption? or are u looking at this saying everyone at that level is doing this? @Mosimanogape Bapo I want you to kill me as you said you want to do. Why are you backing off? "@Fils de l'homme we have the highest steven bantu biko Zondo has been captured by dagga smoke @Jackson what he needs to investigated

Peet i think he is backing off because you are old already and can die peacefully by yourself Kwaaaa @Jackson Mpala what's this guys name "@TheChannel; in short "@welton paulse yes tell this old racist "@Kingsley Mathe the reason they do it like this is to avoid social unrest if a political leader seems to be persecuted "I was always wondering why Zondo loves food too much @Welton Paulse I remain white. 
1:09:50,1:11:51, @Jackson Mpala u r a racist What happened to ANN7? @Fils de l'homme; who has given concrete evidence against Zuma since the begining of this inquiry? Mosimanegape Bapo he doesnt realiz we dont have to listen to them as we were forced to do in the apartheid years. "@Kingsley Mathe it is not about Zuma only ? when is advocate Thandi Norman SC leading evidence "@Monique Jones "@Kingsley Mathe unfortunately they will not go to Prison 
1:11:57,1:14:28, @welton paulse @Peet Venter is of higher quality than u We wuz the kangz "Is there anything special about being white?

1:14:30,1:17:35, only black people who benefited from apartheid and think they are fancy vote DA DA is the most useless political party in the world @Kingsley Mathe No we dont but the inquiry gives to ppl the idea that there was a problem n Zuma will not have an argument to mobilise ppl @Thando Nkutha you can ask for yourself. I wanted to know what happened to it since ENCA stopped streaming online 2 years ago "@Jackson Mpala private school "@Monique Jones @Mosimanegape Bapo if Caucasians didnt come u would be in jungle @Monique Jones why did u do it? "@Fils de l'homme 
1:18:08,1:21:16, "aha! EFF @Thando Nkutha why? So you can ask me why am I interested in SA news? "@Kingsley Mathe @Thando Nkutha I'm far away. Should be asleep but as usual I have a little insomnia "@Fils de l'homme the state capture inquiry is the waste of state resources. the fact of which they go such a long process is an obviously and that need all this commission of inquiry while the country is under crisis. Today they are talking about Guptas and dudzane Gupta @Fils de l'homme that is what the HISTORY of a White person tells u 
1:21:31,1:24:00, @Tshepo Mahlatsi nobody missed u so go away @Thando Nkutha I know all my neighbors and you aren't one of them. @TheChannel kuluma what on earth has injustices of the past to do with criminal behaviour... @Tshepo Mahlatsi I understand ur pain stop referring Tsepeso Tsekwat. where are you since our CO study at Mvumi hispital tz.? anxious to here from you. @Henry Mmbando u need to improve ur vocabulary and sentence construction Zondo has a nose 
1:24:00,1:29:21, I said I'm far away and should be asleep. That would give you some idea @Thando Nkutha 🤔 This all anc doing openly in parliament @Thando Nkutha it's pitch black outside so no I'm not in SA @Thando Nkutha currently I'm in Cali @Thando Nkutha never been to Oz "All of mine are white "question is @peter pott do u still smoke ur pot? 
1:29:34,1:32:07, "@Thando Nkutha I also don't spell neighbor "Fils "@Thando Nkutha I use a ""Z"" instead of ""S"" like in Sanitize or Utilize" @Thando Nkutha we don't queue up but rather line up "haha peter being indian myself i still state catch 5he culprits and jail them don't let anything get away but so do CARTEL'S economic LOOT @Thando Nkutha I don't know how big a hectare is but I know how big an acre and how long feet are lol Fils! we have few international airports too. live if you so wish @Thando Nkutha that's not relative to this convo

G'nite or G'mortin I'm going back to sleep No love connections can be found on a YT or IG or FB or Twitter chat/DM It’s tea break ?? who is testifying next? all rise "I'm very happy with Malema's announcement that whites will also get land because SA belongs to all who live in it. I've never owned property and can now take part in ""illegal"" land occupation." Hahaha @venter 
1:59:30,2:05:06, This is coming to serious now These banks are acting with impunity! we are not safe. I thought they will detail that trail of money being looted but they colluded to close account based on unfounded media report Msholozi will say this guy is misinformed... is captured @sakhile mtshali define impunity Sakhile that is depending on state agency which failed to investigate Guptas and arrest them while they were here only when they left the country now act as if want to arrest them Sakhile Mtshali i think you should listen to the testimonies again. you miss the part of bank client confidentiality. "there decided to affect 1000s of jobs based on unproven reports Stephanie Martins this is commission that is probing transaction follows @sakhile mtshali I thinnk you should testify with all your evidence. 
2:05:38,2:07:55, What do these graphic illustration about state capture say to Zuma? Does he even understand when they say enablers of state capture. Waht a shame my former president "Hello my Bantu "@sakhile mtshali  "Yes "Sakhile money was stolen from us as poor people money that was intended to used for service delivery had being used for Gupta account "@Nelson Musoliwa you and me are a 3rd parties as a result we are not privvy to that info. If the Gupta owned companies felt that the banks colluded they should have approach the courts. Not approach Jacob Zuma. this slide sound similar to the one used to proof what happened after arrival of Boers in Africa😟 I'm yet to see evidence of follows of billions allegedly stolen by the Gupta 
2:09:05,2:11:47, Sakhile wake up. there is one house in Dubai worth $46.000.000 "The Guptas did take the banks to court Sakhile Mtshali some of us see it. Where is the evidence? @sakhile mtshali Im sure the Guptas also wonder what happened to all the money they looted from and subsequently burnt to build Duduzane's house etc in India and the UAE.... "But Sakhile is right "@makhosi nobhatyi @sakhile mtshali u huys have simple minds. if u dont see the picture being drawn than no body can help u Only after a court case will the evidence be shown in public. 
2:11:59,2:14:31, "Lets not be emotional Well then the corruption of the Apartheid times should be exposed. "@Fils de l'homme where is the evidence? i ask again @peter pott what is your point? "Zondo is a great jurist @sakhile mtshali just to be clear.. please define evidence "my point is why is steinhoff accounts not closed @peter pott I ask what your race connotation is all about 
2:14:43,2:16:44, "show me bank statements "@peter pott are u guys listening /watching the witnessing guy or u just fighting over-nothing ? BORING!!! @sakhile mtshali just watch the commission..... plenty of evidence. If you cant see it then turn it off and have some lunch "nonsense "Evidence is with ANC they must come and testify This guy and his colleagues have been studying State Capture for years and in many countries. What he has to say is very interesting to me. Mathe! we need not go that far! Just use recent accounts we read of in our newspapers. No one can answer question I posed 
2:17:04,2:18:44, @sakhile mtshali people provided accounts under oath. It can be used in a court so it can be regarded as evidence 😔😔🗨 "that is a lie "today show me the evidence of State Capture! @peter pott if we are serious about rooting out corruption and state capture then we should go that far @sakhile mtshali provide evidence to the list why is this guy talking ? @sakhile mtshali are you saying there is no state capture? 
2:18:50,2:20:58, @sakhile mtshali Estina Dairy Farm! mathe! lol! they have destroyed the records my man! are you awere the PP found no wrong doing in Estina? @sakhile mtshali eskom Brian Molefe 30million rand pension pay out for 18 Months work @sakhile mtshali yes the captured PP... The one who is a spy... the Zuma lacky nkutha!who is everyone? @sakhile mtshali ....which PP found no wrong doing.... the captured one by any chance????? "The Estina dairy case is bumbling "Lets not be emotional 
2:21:01,2:22:52, This mtshali guy is one who has benefited somehow Non of you can provide evidence that will stand in court. the journo that leak the emails is not testifying "lol! Our current Public protecor was appointed by JZ..... Tom Moyane @Andrew Mc Farlane; National Prosecuting Authority has asked for a postponement of the matter for three to six months as it said evidence was still being gathered for strengthening their case. Why was Duduzani running? we want that basted here the govenor mcdonell case So was Thuli "@Gambu "Those emails are irrelevant  
2:23:03,2:24:42, "I think it is important to be consistency with the matter at hand the Gupta's were handed the country and its finances on a silver platter. the elected politicians are the ones at fault together with those who continue to vote for them. Agree 100% Food parcels.. @Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona on point Flashy cars! big banners! Local Artists at rallys "@Trevor Rolfe 
2:25:46,2:27:32, Mathe! I agree I can prove that Bantus have no sense of the future The NPA was captured... they have no bite to their bark. This Thando person is blinded by fake news I can prove that Bantus dont think about the future I can prove that Bantus wil not imporove the lives of S.Afrians in the next 10 years "here. is another question. in the absence of Guptas now I can prove that Bantus only think about food and sex "@Fils de l'homme 
2:27:37,2:28:37, Don't generalize on your narative. We should have the Guptas behind bars by now if there was evidence fils! you never answered my question on steinhoff? Eskom is using emergency procurement procedures and its costing them a lot more due to the lack of proper management Trevor Rolfe I greed with 100% when it comes to bite to Guptas and Zuma broke I can prove tht Bantus have no sense of No sense of future "@sakhile mtshali There are prominent black leaders with integrity... @Kingsley Mathe Bantu is a disctinctive word which separates u from Nilotics 
2:28:51,2:29:46, @peter pott No I dont smoke ignore the morons. WEEDS LEGAL!!!! Wooohoooo!!!!! @ Sakhile plse call her State protector Guys let us not entertain people who are racist.. "Fils! lol. you don't know @nhlayisi owen magayisa Integrity is a white thing n not black @Thando Nkutha you are being childish . you are failing to prove proof and getting emotional @peter pott what was the question 
2:30:03,2:31:36, @nhlayisi owen magayisa amandla whenever Bantus need an expert they will look for caucasian "@Fils de l'homme @Kingsley Mathe The bantu have no plan for the future Fils! you don't smoke you said lol @Trevor Rolfe did you go to that school where the main war cry was Agelop Agelop? all click on Fils de ľhomme and report it is a Gupta. trying to turn people against each other. @Fils de l'homme Thats RAcist and not true at all! Not sure where your from but it seems your upbringing has skewed your view on race. "@peter pott No I dont lol 
2:31:42,2:33:33, I did "@Fils de l'homme "Just listen to these banks @Trevor Rolfe u know that I am right @Fils de l'homme.. what have you smoke again.... Fils! they are tolerant though. to see people who invaded their space and smile daily to them. this "@nhlayisi owen magayisa nothing lol @peter pott we also built the land 
2:33:34,2:35:43, "How can say there was money looted when the Banks dont have that money "the madala is promoting tourism now.☺☺☺for what they are paying him @Fils de l'homme blah blah blah! "Fils! can't be built @Trevor Rolfe u just dont want to be adamised but u agree with me We cant hear what was suspicious transactions that these companies where involved in. @peter pott without us there would not be water "Sakhile they will start to ask the question on why 4 ministers went to Dubai in one week including Zuma for no real country reason. the answer they carried cash "ALL govt officials should be forced to only use public institutions like hospitals 
2:35:48,2:37:13, Judge Zondo was about to write something but maybe quickly asked himself why they brought this guy here "@Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona u r right that will come out later Bantus must understand their limitations Fils! Lesotho mountain provide water unstoppable to us what is the crime @Michael Wild @peter pott r u the only one who is unaware that SA has water issues ? And by taking 20% ftomeach contract like new trains that don't fit. but commission paid outside SA. State capture - in what form does a state exist and what would capturing it entail. Is it the capture of the person of Zuma or a generic state? 
2:37:21,2:38:52, #Shakile has a point the former PP' state of capture report makes a lot of allegations instead of findings..... the very report suggested that we should have this current inquiry which legal it too is Fils! there is no water crises here. management crises it is. an investigation exercise - but it too appears to be making allegations instead of answers the PP thought will be found in it. this Inquiry is overrated There is no proof of Gupta involvement there @Michael Wild @Street Cred that is why white ppl have a burden to help Bantu so that they can improve "@Fils de l'homme "@peter pott gee Not paying Tax. moving it out of the country starts to weaken the country too. I think Kaufmann is undermining our thinking capability; Countries in transition can invite the investors in a transparent way through their legitimate channels - FDI. 
2:38:58,2:40:27, ALL govt official should be forced to only use public transport. "What is worry is we hear no detail what was laundered block fils "Not semi desert  @Street Cred u r right we need each other @ Fils de l'homme hence your brother begging to be killed Like he said I think he is not aware of and/or studied our current matter regarding STATE CAPTURE; ZUMA and his cohorts misdirected public funds to fraudsters for his indirect benefit through his son "If there was something We would not have any problem if Guptas were here as investor without using the powerful STATESMAN - apex of our governance. 
2:41:44,2:45:17, "We know that Trevor Manual intervened in the appointment of Des Van Rooyen U guus know that Bantus have no sense for the future "SAOE can perform very well if we deploy competent people not thieves "@Fils de l'homme Bantus only think of the sex n food Sakhile mtshali you are brainwashed and your argument is baseless and wasting our time @Street Cred u fuuny "@makhosi nobhatyi are you not aware of the meeting between CR did you know that Fils de Homme had a very troubled childhood? 
2:45:47,2:49:50, @makhosi nobhatyi what is wasting time is listening to these banks lie that there was no colluding Zuma goes around and mislead student that there is no state capture ALL govt officials should be forced to live in squatter camps. It is the fastest way to improve living conditions. I'm yet to hear a sound argument to prove Zuma wrong on his definition of the state "Thwala! those are adults university students @sakhile mtshali likewise am still waiting... @peter pott is leadership what are you waiting for @Kingsley Mathe "Sakhile 
2:49:57,2:52:49, GUYS WHO IS TESTFYING NW ? @sakhile mtshali can you prove the ANC government has improved the quality of education for the poor since 1994? Its no enough to accuse him of handing the state to the Guptas without proving it beyond doubt @sakhile mtshali concrete evidence in the existence of state capture "@Andrew Mc Farlane  It's easy. No country will invest in SA due to weekly disruptions in work and burning of properties. That's what he's actually trying to explain "@sakhile mtshali this people did all this thinking African are illitirate @Street Cred is have not heard or seen evidence so far. If we can take Jonas to court he will not be about to prove the meeting too place 
2:53:02,2:56:03, "mtshali! and you can look straight into the eyes of a white boy who irritates you and tell him FU "@James Sthole @sakhile mtshali and what do you define as normal? Someone who has open eyes and ears? Someone who can rationally think about information? "just when is the gentleman going to be interrogated...?! he has been talking non-stop "@sakhile mtshali if you consider the testimony of Mentor as well as Jonas "@Andrew Mc Farlane my mother was earning salve wage as a domestic worker @sakhile mtshali where is your evidence? "@Andrew Mc Farlane what evidence sir ? 
2:56:22,2:59:31, @sakhile mtshali your testimony my brother.... many African states that were people take adva ntage i never accused anyone of State Capture @James Sthole ??? @Kingsley Mathe of course. Living on a closed island may help... @sakhile mtshali but at the same time you are denying that state capture exists... you have not shown conter arguments to the testimonies "@Andrew Mc Farlane "Are you suggesting i prove that it was not capture @Andrew Mc Farlane? that is easy @Kingsley Mathe just state what you need help on and I can assist 
2:59:37,3:12:31, ALL govt officials must be forced to buy their food from street vendors. It will grow the economy very fast. "@sakhile mtshali prove that Eskom @Andrew Mc Farlane by explaining what you meant by Living on a closed island "@sakhile mtshali you have the time and resources to watch this @Ewald Kruger he must be in the minerals dept and was left over after Zwane left I shall return when he is done 😀 @Andrew Mc Farlane or because his family received a house all is hanky dory. Captured by the free house. ALL govt officials must be forced to only drink tap water. SA will then have the best quality fresh water. "can he also tell us 
3:13:18,3:19:05, I think our country is unique so we will have to work it out on our own There you have it!!! The link between state capture and inequality! "I work in company and need to report any gift over R500.00 to the compliance officer. if I don't I am fired. that could mean anything like sports tickets SA = freebies and corruption "I agree with you michael schebach! we then agree that state was captured prior to 94 for inequality ran deep between color lines? we know before 94 many things where run bad. But wil "The research shows state capture and weakening of property rights go together. No surprises that as state capture becomes stronger we in 2018 and have new rules to prevent going back and should also lock down Goverment right too. 
3:20:19,3:28:09, louw! Is that the reason why land was captured from African ancestors? was motivated such move? pott! was that now before 1652 or early 1800 nguni and bantu stole land from koi koi and san people - how far back do we go How far back are we going to go???? Greg...as far back as when it is to the benefit of the local African "according to the history ive read and to my understanding land trade was done back in the days and yrs before our grandparents were born does the Nguni Have rights to the land or are the Koi koi entitled to the land... technically Loooong time before my gran was alive... id say at least two to three generations ago... I really do not know maybe the world should have exchange of prisoners - all africans to africa and all europeans to europe - really???? phew!!! 
3:28:34,3:32:31, @Greg Stewart 😞 Rolfe! let's live it to both nguni and koikoi to clear. What we know is that those of us with brighter complexion were not part of this continent why? Duduzane went to Dubai to hide everything on February he disappeared with Gupta 😂😂💦💦😂😂 ZUMA IS INNOCENT lol @Jackson Mpala and you are MAD 
3:32:35,3:34:11, But yes he is inocent @Jackson Mpala please explain how Zuma is Innocent SOME OF YOU SHALL TASTE JAIL BEFORE ZUMA Jackson Mampara WHICH COURT HAS FOUND HIM GUILTY "zulus Concourt The only thing Zuma is innocent on is been born a thief...that s his parents fault. Innocent until proven guilty 
3:34:23,3:36:55, of corz Jacob Zuma is innocent the and have been asked many times what he did wrong and not even rhamaphosa can pinpoint a single failure @trevor 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 he was found to have broken his oath of office to protect the constitution of our land zuma told students that he doesnt know about state capture it is an attempt to discredit him - hawu??? and he has never ever been to court on a single state capture charge and Jacob hardly knew the Gupta s it's all a lie lol THIS IS THE GATHERING OF THE ENEMIES OF ZUMA yes mampara even nkandla is a lie there is no such place it's all lies Jacob is a victim and his son lives in a little apartment in Soweto not dubai I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE SO CALLED STATE CAPTURE 
3:37:22,3:38:58, Then you can believe what you want Jackson may I ask u a question what level of education have you got lol dis you get past grade 3 like Jacob Zuma is going to to no prison oh jackie jack?? yes zuma will deny state capture coz he can't spell state capture Or he is a BLF member...
