time,-15:08,message @Teunis van Ree 😂😂😂 "@Kelly Jurgens Exactly @Elvis Malakoane We are the unemployed 😂😂 môre almal And the pensioners trying to save the unicerse via our keyboards. "Zuma thought be could play games with Zondo universe @corrie ferreira Goeie more 
-14:50,-11:02, @M Place Didn't Zuma say he was attending a funeral today and Zondo say it's OK? or did I hear wrong? Butternut will soon be at his own funeral @Aubrey De Bliquy Yes that vile counsel advised Zondo such-how did they get the affidavit while at the funeral @Aubrey yesterday. He should be back today. There’s a bereavement and not that his attending a funeral. "@Vusumuzi G Khambane Thanks "@LESLY MOTLOUTSI Zondo will not agree-they will go on review and fail @Vusumuzi G Khambane Many thanks for the clarification Was it that funeral of the Head of the institute of Chartered Accountants he attended? I did not see him there unless the cameras avoided him. 
-10:49,-6:47, hallo @corrie ferreira 🌷 Hi Teunis van Ree GM all. @Aubrey Lol!!!! Just pray for Zondo. It is because of times like these that men of strong moral integrity grace our bench. if Zondo recuse himself the whole commission is likely to be doomed given the loopholes that might be created if he not present particularly with this key current witness Mr JZ @Heather Durr waiting eagerly. hope Zondo carries on. we can't have this commission collapsing because of one man. hi @Andre Gerber 
-6:30,-3:54, Gaan ons iets hoor vandag @LESLY MOTLOUTSI That is one of the points they need to consider ZONDO IS A COOL AND CALM PERSON NPA must charge those who committed fraud and corruption and leave Zuma alone "Schabir Shaik was diagnosed with a teminal illness....yes I think the commission is nearly finished its work. If the recusal fails Zuma will just be recorded as a hostile witness which will just make him look more guilty. @Corrie miskien otherwise postponement zondo is far smarter than zuma or that slimy lawyer Zondo is cooked meat today. Zuma just filled another affidavit 
-3:40,-1:08, wiNdoda Zuma kushintsha izinto mekungena wena mfanakithi ngiyakuvuma. "Zuma is quite smart nie alweer nie "Last kicks of a dying horse  you are right Courage and strength is another factor he(Zondo) needs @Aubrey De Bliquy But osalayo he is guilty "DCJ must continue "Today Zuma have Covid "Zuma playing games 
-0:47,1:04, Zuma is actually the reason why South Africa has not been moving forward...nothing in his life moves forward. . . now we are stuck here because of him. neh man. Zuma is capturing the commision covid is a scam it has more in common with medieval superstition than science. "@Philip head of intelligence but to me why fight back for taking the stand on the state of capture?there is alooooot he is hiding @JOHN TYERS true that. @Kelly Jurgens you have a point Volume please Nazoooooo "20 
1:23,2:50, Blesskop is smiling Ha Umsholozi Madoda....... They should sentence him today...and end the commission... @Phillip Thabo Letsoalo Zondo can ignore this alleged affidavit filed by your corrupt hero dont you people have work to do. @M Place agree!!! @Mashudu he is part of the equation but he was also fighting against NWO. @M Place Zuma is not the accused and this is not a trial. You sound like the Queen of Hearts in Alcie in Wonderland. LOL OFF WITH HER HEAD!!! Alice 
2:51,3:45, let's it begin "JZ forgot his mask Milton Taju wish people are u talking about here "Just in time Zondo must reinstate Pravin Gordan to come and testify... Is there no sound or is my PC on mute? More ALTA.. It was on mute. LOL Zuma's legal team got their tails up. It will soon be between their legs..... 
3:47,5:14, @Milton Taju don't you have work to do? I see a Skelm on my Screen. If you think this is only a domestic issue. Watch the rand if all this goes south today. This is a pivotal moment as it may prevent our slide to a Zimbabwe-like outcome. Morning all you lovely people! "R10 this is one of those groundbreaking moments. Taju phuma kithina asizele wenala Bru ok "talking conspiracy about Covid and complaining only about everything The father of radical economical theft 
5:19,6:19, adv.Musi Shikhakane is the sharoest tool in the shed.Go Musi go Zondo will not recuse himself """Waiting for Zondo!!!""'..." And here we go....... @Milton Taju I believe the commission is not there to solve problems that's my view 3 ... 2... @Milton Taju The commission is just part of a process of accountable government under law without which neither Zuma not Malema nor CR can save what is left of this country. CAMERAMAN I DO NOT WANT TO WATCH THE MOTHER OF ALL CORRUPTERS 
6:19,6:58, @Avis Yetti who you going with? "I would like to comment today as "" Nkosi Motolo"" because I think it's going to be very hot on chat show today." I wish DCJ dont recuse himself ... 1... "With 14 children and a ""love child"" he sure has a lot of bank accounts to try and hide stolen tax payers money" hi guys Sikhakhane will throw tantrums if he loses to a white opponent😂 Where are Zuma's teeth "@Avis Yetti I presume yo are talking about the same Musi that copied 
6:59,7:29, "Um haa advantages of being a former Head of State Stop laughing Zuma! Back from the mid week funeral Advocat Musi Shikhakane is the sharpest tool in the shed. hey @Pastor J.J "uBaba just sent a ""Please call me"" 🤣" "Social distancing goodmorning everyone 😃 @Pastor J.J Hi yes 
7:30,8:11, Rest Zuma Rest He will not recuse himself and Zuma must take the stand thereafter.
