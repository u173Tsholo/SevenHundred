The project to audit 300 000 houses in just over two months means they did almost 5000 houses per day if they were working weekends as well! That is over R4m a day. How big was this team!

44:29,46:39, "@Thando Nkutha Cr's mistake was to try and strike a balance between the two factions within the ANC EXACTLY what I have been asking myself since he mentioned it the first time. Judge not picking up on that?? @Bongumusa Mabika ​ ...300 000 houses in just over two months How big was this team! Are things live again "@Terence Makgalo @Thando Nkutha he is not above the law by virtue of being ANC SG. is it CR duty to arrest or charge him? "if you have politicians in power just fogt about rooting out corruption We would see Skhakhane here and not that other counsel @Tavhanyeni Tshkovhele. I don’t think so Hawks and NPA should be working hard! Mr Nxamalala...no one else

But on the other side they messing up the state "@Thando Nkutha you may be correct @Tavhanyeni Tshikovhele Ohk thanks It’s not him @Malinti Pika. Why use a different counsel and not Skhakhane The ANC do not have a Dustbin for their corrupt ministers they have a Recycle Bin. is he still on when is he going to stop listening to himself thus guy should be the President! "This is a part of clean up 
49:26,50:39, I suspect Mr X is somebody who was the MEC for Human Settlement judge wants a nap even the judge is yawning "Mr X is Ace am afraid. lf all this comes out be true it will mean that the divisions btwn the ruling part will multiply simple because Ace must therefore be fired and his supporters will be provoked. @Thando Nkutha i though SAPS & HAWKS were responsible for that "@Sindiswa Moolman lol i just come of a nap because of the tape recorder that is still yapping away Ace was all-powerful in the FS 
51:15,52:47, "@Thando Nkutha but we dont know that he doesnt fast track The real problem is that we have a government that transformed from a revolutionary movement. In a revolution you shut up and do as you are told. Now we have inexperienced politicians. This is so sad ppl they pay with their blood so that we could all benefit in this county .today we talk about ppl who eat the hard fought freedom for their benefits "give this guy a bells This person through his attorney mentioned that he is still involved in politics and in government Born free you right there @Sindiswa Moolman - this person is Mxolisi Dukwana. hope he has a major bodyguard crew.

Mr Magashule He looks very distinguished with his white hair. "Ace said he will sue Peter Louis Myburgh when his book was published but they had the book yestersay outlined so he is detailing everything and naming now tin fine detail 
59:05,1:00:07, do bantus get blonde hair as they age? @Fils there are many senior black people who have white/ grey hair 🤣🤣🤣🤣 @ Born free the Judges are no longer wearing those long white wigs so the dye their hair nowadays..😂😂 CR is not in a hurry to act watch the space next year lot of people who will be fired he said he will sue mr dukwana too..here he is sitting with no response from Ace's legal team.. "jacqui if all the persons that are in some way or other are conected to coruption just go away or disapear the unemployment will be halved imeadiatly hair is hair man..jeez 
1:00:20,1:01:34, is the bantu capable of running a state?

Who is Thabo Manyoni? Ace is in trouble here I must say manyoni was bloem mayor Asbestos causes primary lung cancer and mesothelioma which is cancer of the lining of the lungs 
1:03:35,1:05:39, the witness leaders head are nicely polished SON OF MAN...aka fils se l'homme..this is a witness he is testifying I think the color or texture of his hair is not as concerning Thabo Manyoni....Sandile Msibi(the late)...have experience with these crooks who is jimmy tau Thulani Bukani he has got no chance to charge the guy Ace must just forget Asbestos also causes cancer of the abdominal lining.....a class action against the asbestos mining UK bosses was succesful in SA once manyoni warns them about corruption was expelled i am confused about the lack of names been given or not as in mr x why not just say ace or cr or jz we need to know all the ceooks and not the alfabet "@Thulani Bukani Ace Magashule won’t win anything as far as I know 
1:05:40,1:09:20, Magda I understand that but that is when the asbestos is disturb like drilling cutting sawing it the dust particles than filtrate your nostrils and throat and eventually end up in your lungs.. The witness is telling the truth Provincial govt employees can attest to his evidence "In 2008 the mining "me for one have seen corruption first hand and bore the scars of their ability to ""get rid"" of whistle blowers" "Asbestos roofs were never removed and i thank you godfrey...it is still there hence my question why the BIG PROJECT I worked extensively in the advocacy for rehabilitation of asbestos in SA...the ANC dropped everythi g and people are still being diagnosed i know of some old mines that stil have stores with asbestos roofing painted black i have been the contracter that have done the job for several buildings as well as repairs and did ask the qeustion 
1:09:33,1:11:29, the colour of his hair has nothing to do with all his statement. let's listen to what he is saying and use the correct methods to find out if his allegations are true or untrue 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ where is the money of gysers were suppose to be installed to all houses in FS gone to drain Zwane must account as to why the Ace asbestos projection was allowed but he is off course also a Gupta lackey at the time..he was Miniter of Environmental Affairs exactly Magda people are still suffering yet we listening here to millions that was supoose to eradicate this hazardous issue.. "Yes The level of corruption skyrocketed during Jacob Zuma's tenure as president .. Are these people who looted the state rich now? 
1:11:36,1:13:29, I am no doctor hey direct your question to our ecpert here Magda I am pretty sure she can extensively lecture u and give proof I had so many projects includi g against fracking in the Karoo.I eventually left SA due to the insidious corruption of the ANC @Danie - yesterday Mr X's attorney asked that his client's name not be mentioned I dobhowever know of cases where ppl died due to extensive exposure to asbestos at their work environments... I will not answer to insults... asbestos is a deadly substance yes i know a few miners in asbestos mines dead some years ago long before death was due asbestos grows in the lungs the children that play on the dumps get sick serioulsly when is. Ace coming 
1:13:37,1:15:14, gum gum gumuley geepeex1 this is worrying you hey This week we are cleaning Free-state I hope Northwest would follow those who know something should come to the commission and it is of use how???

1:15:16,1:17:48, the witness must get high security protection from the commission. Hey you will never know. Too much of death are happening now. I suspect this Mr X is Zwane @Magda Seguin. Mr x Zuma I am going to confess. I AM MR.X Rand and Ace enemies Hope so @makhosi nobhatyi. That Mahumaphelo was with Ace and Zwane in this looting aaaahh Pastor.... you live at Nkandla ? removing and abolishing abestors roofing is well known fact l don't think that we still have asbestors producing factories in where in country noooo 
1:17:51,1:20:26, I love their cool SA accents!! Hahaha... @Pastor J lol All money gone to Dubai What is the best place to visit if you come to SA?? @Sindiswa Moolman I felt the urge and need to ensure the speedy conclusion of all the speculation until we all find out via the evidence about who this Mr X is. hahahaha Thank you Mxolisi Dukwana for representing us well at the commission particularly the officials who were thrown under the bus no asbestos is a crap material what about nuclear ie plotoniam so for one substance is ok today will be crap tomorrow I am connecting the dots now why they were all meeting at hotel in Durban something they were planning but media caught them as surprised @ Sindiswa Moolman
