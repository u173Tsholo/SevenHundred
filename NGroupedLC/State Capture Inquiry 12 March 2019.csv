37:42,41:10, @Norman Zwane just a proverbial statement and not literally involving a gun @Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly I 'honestly' thought it would work. Just watch her and eat your heart out knowing what you are missing. "@ Norman Zwane Ayiboo! Ayanda she cannot recall about the letter. How on earth can someone prepare a letter for you and you just sign and not read to see if its correct or not. Now you come here you can't recall anything. "We want Moyane here to account @Felix Muyoba Very proverbial sir. No chance of me ever being Lekau literal. "@Perverted Pervert Perving Pervertedly You love dark chocolate Mpofu not gd enough

49:33,50:44, @Norman Zwane. You mean his acting now?😂😂😂 his at the movie? Wait till the real crooks come to testify...I wonder what you guys will say then...The Guptas are in hiding and you are blaming minions Zondo cut too close to the bone and the crook cracked. Many more will cry and shed crocodile tears... have I missed anything exciting? This is pure comedy😂 Liar Liar did not know that men can also weep like little babies Where is the saintly Matshela Koko? @Desmond Masilela I think it is the effects of the cameras and lights Des. 
50:59,51:55, You guys are bloodthirsty...The Bosasa captured ANC thieves are comfortable but you are less vitriolic to them Can Koko come take the stand @zinchy da guy iz denying being alerted of any fraudulence Men are human too...stop being misogynistic and sexist 😂😂😂😂😂😂 waste of time @Norman Zwane 😂😂😂😂. His not used of cameras and lights @Magda Seguin: We were equally critical about them! The whole country was up in arms! Where have you been kanti? just in time for a comedy show 
51:56,53:34, Ia @Magda Seguin I don't like the word 'vitriolic'. I think that he took all the pressures of his ESKOM job home and his wife could not deal with it and divorced him that is why he is emotional... he is not a crook in any way @Yin Yang well educated but a THIEF "You don't know me Can you hear they busy laughing at this guy comedy @Norman Deane get a dictionary *Zwane oof 
53:43,54:47, He is not divorced Indeed the truth shall set him free! Unbelievable!!! . these Crooks crying Croc tears. 5 years of getting bribes and stealing lenja @Desmond Masilela Ya it is. I once started waving at people I did not know at the airport when the caneras and lights started flashing. I only realised later that Nkosazana zuma was behind me. Ufun indlela yokushaya iyvalo😂 @Yin Yang.The truth shall set him free @than do cezula I watch so ce the beginning.. Don't insult my I intelligence 
54:57,57:32, Koko and his ilk destroyed people's lives @Norman Zwane 😂😂😂😂😂 SOUTH AFRICA IS A COUNTRY OF COMMISSION OF ENQUIRIES This guy didn't suffer at all! Some people focus on minor people who were manipulated while the thieves and Guptoids are free a d Sri are all He was cushioned in between piles of payoffs and cosy positions Many don't understand what went down and the psychosis of state capture @Magda Seguin: It's all about connecting the dots! The small guys matter in building the puzzle #Yin Yang.. 
57:51,59:09, If you are a real man you have to trust your koko Cry me a river! crying again What is a 'strong' man?...an abuser? Take him out Yini yona i #Yin yang? the small guys are the only ones who will be prosecuted the big boys walk away with their millions @Norman Zwane 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I can not believe this really. waving to ppl you dont know... come on bra you killing me ppl keep on asking me what am i laughing. When all the lights go out as is happening in Venezuela you guys will understand the full impact of what Zuma did to SA 
59:19,1:02:15, @Musa Bakiti I think the wife denies him some 'koko' too. Hope his not going to cry again Zuma and his whole cabinet rhamaphosa deserves all hes getting he sat quiet as a mouse when all this was transpiring IHe has a black wife and she cannot take his koko anymore Come clean! Reveal all! @Desmond Masilela To a novice like me that is what Cameras and lights do. Everyday Eskom reports that 'there may be load shedding' @Norman Zwane.Ya i understand "@Kapn Krunch I know you wanted to say it. Spit it out: ""and a big mouse too""" 
1:02:37,1:06:13, so he still has so more hours to shed those croc tears I think Me Hofmeyer is acting like a prosecutor...she went so far as to insinuate guilt Why is Zuma not subpoenaed? @kapn krunch you don’t have knowledge how does he behave in a meeting so I believe Ramaphosa was questioning other decision and was not happy with Zuma response at parliament but defeated by majority @Magda Seguin You try and see how many appeals he will lodge. South Africa media are weak .How possible all media houses could miss all the mess . "Some men on this thread are rude @M @makhosi nobhatyi You don't have knowledge of that either - you're just guessing what Ramaphosa said at meeting. It suits your agenda to think that - where is the proof? 
1:06:18,1:08:50, hi Guys. just login now. I read that this guy cried. what was the reason? @Norman Deane my question was rhetorical Well said @Magda Seguin - and often off the topic of discussion @Eslon Eslon. Emotions The chair just squeezed him hard@Eslon Eslon "@Eslon Eslon Judge Zondo upset him @Neil Fraser True This guy sounds like he is not too interested in his own testimony "@Albert Noah 
1:09:00,1:11:41, Eskom is inthe pocket of Ramaphosa and family as Bosasa in the pocket of Zuma and family and Bidvest in the pocket Helen Zille "This man is not at Eskom anymore @Eslon Eslon His mom did send a note that he is sensitive @Norman Zwane hahaha no man! @Norman. You are being facetious "Derek main welcome I am? Yes it's obvious 
1:13:17,1:16:00, i dont think he is answering the question.. @makhosi nobhatyi The entire country knew long ago what Zuma was up to because it was widely reported in the media especially with regard to the Guptas. The only people who didn't want to see it were the ANC including their leaders (Ramaphosa as well). lo bhuti "@Norman Zwane @Norman Zwane not funny at all..This is a serious matter but why would people still vote such a party with corrupt individuals "@Derek Main with a nose that huge Eff✊🏿 come May 19 eff will nationalise eskom in my lifetime ! And never compensate! 
1:16:05,1:18:21, Wallace u have choice Zuma is a psychotic narcissicist...he doesn't care about people's lives @Magda Seguin Fecetious. Not funny I concede. "@Norman Zwane As I said I am blocking @Norman Zwane he is totally I appropriate...go play elsewhere EFF is the party to vote before Karima Brown destroy it I think eff kids needs to understand how to run the country. "@Derek Main He was born that way @Norman Zwane Who is he? 
1:19:07,1:21:29, @Derek Main exactly...who is he after all? @Derek Main Him who was there when Zuma messed up. 9 wasted years... "@Norman Zwane In fact I see that nobody here are shocked that people died on Gupta mines And the rest they say is history - all that was predicted of Zuma came to pass. Only the ANC fools couldn't see it. The ANC has a lot to answer for. the ANC elected Zuma as president after a rape case that for me is nuff said "@Wallace 
1:21:55,1:24:43, The ANC kept Zuma as president after he was found by the Concourt to have violated his Oath Of Office. The ANC at that point was truly broken! rhamaphosa gave Zuma a job after all the corruption not exactly the right path Spot on @Musa Bakiti "What we must all remember Zuma put people in the position who will say yes boss if not you are fired @Eslon Eslon The entire ANC is responsible for this mess - why should we vote for them? What happened to collective responsibility? ANC NEC members moved a vote of no confidence on Zuma twice. It was defeated by his acolytes. this guy is just story telling.. if africa had justice Zuma would be in prison his family and friends would be stripped of their wealth @makhosi South Africans have short memories...You are right 
1:24:45,1:26:58, @Mzalwane Mzala So the majority of the ANC were happy with Zuma's behaviour. because leaders get away with these things the next leaders arent even scared The ANC at some point had around one million members. Brian Molefe has a LOT to account for...he was totally captured @Derek Main Ramatlhodi gave us some insight how Zuma went about his business. From what I gleaned one would have needed real balls to wreck the Zuma train. I do not however condone the silence pact. even Mugabe still is walking around with his millions untouched @Mzalwane Mzala That's one million fools too many. "@Derek Main @Norman Zwane Yes - we know the ANC doesn't have balls. They were too happy feeding at the trough to rock the boat. 
1:27:01,1:28:38, who wins the people or the leaders who are still rich The only problem with JZ is to work with Indians if he worked with Afrikaaners he would be a hero @Eslon Eslon Where was Cyril for the last 7 years? Winter is coming and Eskom is struggling to keep the lights on...At Nkandla they probably have generators You can even read the guys eyes that his a liar. Cyril rhamaphosa was given his billions by trevor Manuel 🤣🤣🤣 "@Thando Nkutha yes it is "@Derek Main I think the TOP 6 were weaklings @Desmond Masilela That's an incorrect assumption on your part. 
1:28:45,1:30:32, he couldn't even make billions himself @Mzalwane Mzala I will definitely take on any ANC apologists who try to sugar-coat the destruction the ANC has caused SA. Try to defend it if you can. Musa Bakiti well said . Zuma is guilty of working with Indian and Glencore poeple in Eskom they we no longer eating. he is the result of an African enrichment program @Derek Main You never again insult me as that might haunt you. welcome once again this Afr24News today get ready to brew your mind ANC Trash! Nowhere in the world has liberation organisations assured proper government...They are in it for their own interests...their motto is 'it's our time to eat' Look auditing firm kpmg was appointed to follow the suits if not they must jump out 
1:31:01,1:32:30, Waiting for Hlaudi and Mr Maleka. anc officials have openly stated we did not struggle to be poor "@Mzalwane Mzala I'm not superstitious. Where have I insulted you? If the cap fits watch a video on YouTube called tainted heroes and see the truth All SOE's in SA was destroyed by Zuma "@Derek Main His relieved now. @Desmond Masilela very much so YEBO Adv Maleka tea please 
1:32:53,1:34:47, "@Eslon Eslon He could have spoken out and made it clear that he was against what was happening. Since he didn't "#Mzalwane - So Am I wrong? @Derek Main...he said so right at the beginning of his testimony...he said it three times I have no respect for someone who doesn’t respect people and nation what Zuma did reminds me how mugabe did with Zim. Uma rands goes down always defend his acts saying they will pick up rand if it fal canada do nail who/ @Magda Seguin I was talking about Ramaphosa My adv Maleka If Maleka was a car he could be Toyota corola briliants 
1:34:53,1:36:24, Apologies @Derek Main "Is only a fool who doesn't see  Top story: Dome People in South Africa appear to demand EFF member slapping security official of Parliament. They forget Is the one who beefed up by ANCorruptions members{ witness} @Derek Main Those who seek public office must have sterner stuff and be ready to bat against an onslaught. There can be no excuse for these guys. They became crooks and need be judged as such. Yose Human 😃😃😃😀😀 @Magda Seguin no problem @Norman Zwane Agree with you there Eyyyy!!!!! Oak... "eish 
1:36:28,1:38:03, The Guptas have SA nationality...They are hiding in Dubai as the Indian authorities are also investigating them @Felix Muyoba. 😂😂 Whats up bra? the witness So many public officials turned a blind eye to what was happening. Toooooo many!!! "Yes agree with Moira T - No elections in May "@Derek Main I hope this one will not be another Afrikaaner @Felix Muyoba . What is wrong with the witness?😂😂😂 But i know what you are thinking and I'm thinking the same. @Musa Bakiti looks like he is 
1:38:33,1:39:51, @Derek Main Shamefully I must confess to have voted ANC in the past. Never again!!! These guys took us backward whilst claiming to be delivering progress. @Eslon Eslon You mean the WMC media? No - I don't recall that. @Desmond Masilela then we are on the same page..no comment "My favourite advocate Suzie mr maleka He looks white not like afrikaaner @Norman Zwane Same here and never again. @Felix Muyoba. Lets leave it there bra. we are on the same page indeed. @Yose Yabhibhidla mean you're blaffing 
1:40:15,1:44:15, headline: Grandmothers in KZN to thanks the Truth Organisation EFF for discovering corruption disease within ANC body Guys seriously I'm also stuck who then is the alternative skelm to vote for @Afr24News Channel Maybe it's time the EFF started looking inward. #Musa Bakiti - I’m a proud White / Afrikaner / South African born. #ItsOKtoBeWhite "@Derek Main Squirrel-Hippo-Face knee FULL WELL what was going on! "@Yose Human you hatred towards Zuma should not be generalized to Zulus as a whole ..and you are no different to people that cause divisions in our country  @Moira T Ayi wena afrikaaners are not white.Orania people are not white. "We are not scared of Zuma 
1:44:23,1:46:36, "@Eslon Eslon I must have missed that. Never thought Zuma was ever opposed hence his exit line:""What have I done?""" #Musa - and you are not human! @makhosi nobhatyi I am with you @makhosi nobhatyi We've waited for too long for the ANC to do the right thing - no more. @Norman Zwane Two votes of no confidence were moved in the ANC NEC @Yose Human your generalization about the Zulus shows how shallow your thoughts and views are. You cannot be taken serious period @Thami Zungu you are right my brother Generalisations are not in order @Nkululeko Zondo I am with you there my brother 
1:46:40,1:48:45, I applaud the those who have been ignoring the racist comments being made by person. Let's keep ignoring him and don't give him a platform to speak his racists comments. the same commission we are watching is chaired by a Zulu what do you have to say about that @Yose Human ? "@Mzalwane Mzala I thought that was quite bold at the time EXCLUSIVE: Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson paid a R5m 'bonus' amid job losses @ Yose human your comments about zulus reflect negatively on your character it's not ok to be derogatory to a nation because of a minority "Derek main I do understand I was feeling the same but after Naserec conference I feel hopeful and confidence that things zizojika "Norman Zwane "@Yose Human The level of self hate is the reason why you always single out ""Zulu people"" as an object to express your hatred. What is really there for you to gain in all your expressions of hate?" @Norman Zwane Ngoako explained that his acolytes were many in the NEC. People were ordered back from Mzwandile Masina's wedding in Cape Town to come and bolster his defence 
1:49:10,1:52:24, @makhosi nobhatyi So you're happy to go along with more promises from the ANC. They only promise but don't deliver. Not falling for that again. @Eslon Eslon I am certainly not denying it. I'm just upset it resulted into nothing. @makhosi nobhatyi The only reason Ramaphosa is doing something now is that he realises the ANC is in serious trouble. It's a matter of survival not a moral fortitude. Yose is a despicable troll - always has been - always will be. A hate-filled loser. "on a more serious note now ..for the first time in my life I am not sure who to vote for  @ Musa you guys are now being childish are we really going to play with hiv & pretent it's something to wish on your worst enemy..do you even consider your family members when uttering such irrespo "@Yose Human awusiyeke kancance ndoda ngezinto zakho We are yet to hear DA SCANDALS WHERE THEY GOVERN N IFP BUT ANC is well known mahodu "Ramaphosa has huge job 
1:52:41,1:55:02, @Mzalwane Mzala I was saying as much to @Derek Main. I just found the weak lambs who easily toed the line disgusting. It is them that made me feel that the ANC is beyond redemption. They still there. "Two weeks before (AGO) - formerly known as Bosasa - was placed under liquidation @Derek Main true that "@Norman Zwane @Norman Zwane They are now in a weaer position and a number of them have turned their backs on that regime. @yose human you might be a bit naive to believe ramaphosa is a saint They are in a weaker position @Norman Zwane They are no longer in the majority "As a matter of interest: Anybody in the Know

"@Funani Manzi Before I waste your time let me own up I think Ramaphosa is waiting till after the election and Ben Ngubane @Bumbano Enzelwe i agree..we are just hearing who stole what..thats all.. can we Expect Some Arrest or it jus a Time consuming 
2:15:28,2:18:35, @Norman Zwane... Makhosi Khoza was willing to throw away her political career. eventually it happened but CR was conscious of his political future as deputy president of ANC @Sthakathi Khumalo Mtungwa nami ngizo beka indlebe la ebandla. impilo yona isekhona. Okungu Koko lokhu kucabanga ukuthi kukhona impunga yehlathi. Kungekudala kuzovela obala kubhushuzela kunqunu Nobody will be arrested......even Zuma said regarding SSA......do not disclose as he will open things they all may regret. just started watching @Eslon Eslon Actually for not willing to throw his political career makes him subject to compromise for me. i rather like the sort of life of committing only to things you can just walk away from. If you arrest all the guilty........you may as well empty half the country Chris zuma need to come to the commision including u "@Magda... Spot on 
2:19:05,2:23:00, "Guys i think we must read and know things before we judge or make decisions EFF on Oxford Union: Ramaphosa sold his black skin to white mining owners for shares just to protect them from slave salary. that bring us to Malikana massacre to impress white people {UK} @Chris Bard I read an opinion that suggested that a Corruption TRC may serve us better than trying people in courts. Do you buy into that option? Republic of Corruption..... Only Hotels and restaurants gain from theses commisions African National Corruption (ANC) Sipho amen @Funani Manzi Do you believe in the concept of collective responsibility? @derek yebo 
2:23:33,2:27:51, @Derek Main i for one dont believe in that..some anc members will tell you that you are on your own.. "till now Zondo must tell us when is he going to supoane Zuma here In a collective responsibility everyone has his/her role to answer I wonder what is in that envelop!!!!! @Funani Manzi So why do you not think Cyril should not be held collectively responsible for Zuma's destruction of SA? those sealed documents have explosive info "@Felix Muyoba So when it suits the ANC Desmond Masilela​I wonder what is in that envelop!!!!! Must be the subpoena for Jacob Zupta 
2:29:00,2:31:31, "@Sipho At the TRC hearings @Thelsa. Lets hope so. Is these a guy from Standard bank? Joshua Doore I think those are the funds that was transfer to ministers. All the ANC NEC members under Zuma's leadership must be held accountable for this state capture "@Derek Main That 'collective' nonsense is the same as 'its an allegatior ""I have appealed the ruling""on""" @Welton LOL! 😂 😂😂😂😂 Joshua Doore... 
2:31:34,2:32:54, This guy is white and is going to recall everything unlike afrikaaners @Welton Paulse. what is Joshua Doore? Not even one person will go to jail Remember Zuma was not responsible for this country they were no collective decision that was taken by NEC because premier league were controlling everything with zuma and Guptas.Ramaphosa was a observ @Sipho I think all ANC voters should be held responsible for subjecting SA to Zuma's criminality. @Musa Bakiti The 'uncle' in the furniture business News hour: SABC Digital News is trending online live streaming 1830+ watching State Capture inquiry this comes due to South Africa want to know who to vote this coming election "@Norman Zwane Or ""we can't suspend implicated persons that have not been found guilty by a court of law""." ANC were scared of ZUma thats it 
2:33:04,2:34:38, @Funani Manzi Say that again? this nonsense about collective was directed by 1 person Ramaphosa is leading the renewal why oh why didnt they do anything then? if the collective did something SA would not be in this situation @Norman Zwane 😂😂😂😂 Uncle J @Funani Manzi Why did all ANC MPs protect Zuma time and again in parliament? Arrest Zuma then all dominoes will fall @Derek Main I'm going to wake up and replace my 'crap detector' so that I never ever miss rubbish like that again. 
2:34:57,2:36:32, little time wasted on commisions It is risky for some people to keep on asking why others did nothing to stop something in the PAST. That question can be asked of them in some crimes against humanity. Go for the head of the snake of corruption Arrests and suspensions of parliamentarians should by now have been made @Norman Zwane Yep - we've been burnt once too many times - we can't allow it to happen again. Zuma has a sharing spirit unlike Ramaphosa he only share with his family Indeed @ welton Derek are you ANC member? @Funani Manzi Not a chance - I'm too honest to be one. 
2:36:43,2:38:28, @David Jacobs NEC had majority of Zuma supporters that's why they couldn't remove him easily Zuma is the skelm "@david jacobs Whilst that may be a popular thought "Musa Bakiti They are the same cloth @Eslon Eslon What about parliament? They protected Zuma from any sanction. @Derek not all the ANC MP’S were following that mediator @Norman Zwane i dont think its a thought Zuma is the main man "Anyways "@Funani Manzi According to the vote counts

AWEH @ Tobo @Afr24News Channel TROLL 
3:04:05,3:06:51, @Norman Zwane​@Mzalwane Mzala I I hold only one vote AND it is not going to the ANC. I hope I never over estimate my importance.-YOUR VOTE IS VOICELESS "@Felix @Yose Human I heard senzo Mchunu praising Ramaphosa what do you mean? @Cassius Mngomezulu If you insist I concede it is. For those who are still looking for political party to vote for remember that Narius Moloto will be on the ballot paper for the PAC dont think so "But Senzo Mchunu is in CR's camp so should we watch Matamela yes @Thando Nkutha. I would do so because this one is going down like VBS 
3:07:27,3:12:00, @LoneSouthAfricanBear in your dreams!! Is the PAC president not Mzwanele Nyotso? DA leader Musi Maimane is promising better life for all there is encouraging South Africans to put this country forward{DA manifesto} @Ntombethemba Manase They made a deal in court for Nyhontso to act as deputy for six months. OK Mzalwana. Yes lets vote ANC hello Lets vote ANC @Matodzi Netsianda Only if you are happy with self-enriching criminals running our government. 
3:12:33,3:15:09, Malema voted as first political member who straight forward talk without political speech that goes around to confuse news viewers. @Matodzi Netsianda You may even win but as for me NO! As I am not a born free my vote is for the liberation Movement. 1. ANC and if it ever change it could be AZAPO etc NO for a change because Matamela is waiting for his term to act not these few months of completing Zuma term "@Mzalwane Mzala and they're still liberating you @Mzalwane Mzala Respect! @Matodzi Netsianda Matamela is already working to fix the country. I vote ANC lets support him @Norman Zwane Thanks 
3:15:27,3:17:34, @Jack Sparrow Maybe you ought to respect @Mzalwane Mzala decision. hello @Norman Zwane vote for thieves and you're complicit "Vote for ANC stop zuma Those who fought against the national liberation movements (NLM) continues to hate them. I never listened to beneficiaries of apartheid and I will not start now. "@Mzalwane Mzala ""They liberated us"" - that's a tired old excuse." ANC has a mature open transparent leader who's busy repairing and bandaging the country from further bleedings @Mzalwane Mzala I fought for the NLMs. The current ANC are not them Who was there when the plunder was happening and said nothing. 
3:18:13,3:21:33, Even those who pretend to be the best and forming their new political parties they are the products of corruption Which ones? "MANYI "@Jack Sparrow I wont be voting ANC (my choice) "Zuma's convoy shows no sign to resign watch it go to Afri24News but before leaving SABC Digital News please click like Guys the ANC is renewing forget about the Zuma shenanigans @Derek are you telling me this white guys who are testifying are implicated because of they were not saying anything? hello @Eslon Eslon Yeah...new buses going to the same destination as far as I am care. 
3:22:08,3:24:41, @Norman Zwane People like you are rare here @Eslon Eslon Not so fast - the rot runs deep. Yes thats why they are living a R2M life whereas they are earning R80K Lifestyle audits right there! I don't trust Malema and his double standards tendencies. The superior logic with no discipline and maturity is meaningless @Eslon Eslon Me neither "@Funani Manzi Yes I am - if they did not disclose corruption Me also n me too l dont trust Malema 
3:25:38,3:28:10, Yes he is having double standards Malema IF the EFF will rule this country-this country will be a graveyard "African political monitors: Every President in Africa is\was in corruption cases exp: Malawi Muluzi @Cassius Mngomezulu how? l.think by that time Malema was a puppet they used him He was angry with Zuma because Zuma used him to ascend to Presidency but later dumped him "When the Gupta curry started to heat up in the public domain "Malema is also used by Mafia Malema and his battalions are political hooligans in the SA political arena 
3:28:24,3:31:20, Yes thats why he is renting a cigarette mafia house @Mahosi😂😂😂 Grand theft SA brought to you by Zuma and the Guptas Now beware guys Malema first bunkrupted Limpopo Gov and now VBS now he is heading to Gauteng @Bridgette Kekana In certain quarters it is whispered that the cigarette smugglers have Malema in their tobacco boxes. "Those who go out of Anc form parties or join parties are opportunitist not representative of people Taxpayers money... eish transnet @Zwane😂😂😂
