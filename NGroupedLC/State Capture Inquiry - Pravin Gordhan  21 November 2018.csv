time,8:41,message morning Third of the Gordan lecture bn "he looks tired what now SABC?? what??? "he is shaken by malema "Hayi I dont think he is shaken 
9:13,11:19, "eff is playing mind games on him I never seen him shaken at all "He is not shaken at all Third and last day for PG in the hot seat haven't heard anything I have never heard before guys Malema is confused he went to court when PG was fired now he is against pg EFF have nothing meaningful to say or to contribute to the debate. Most of the comments in the last two days have been mindless "He wouldn't appear shaken obviously if they have anything tangible they must bring it to the commission Gordhan must clarifies the allegations that he was involved in fund raising for the Zuma's re-election in 2012 &we all know that the Gupta funded the campaign 
11:21,14:27, "Real thugs are committed to their duty this is boring. """How can Pravin be part of the corrupt ANC and not be rotten himself? Why do you say the ANC is corrupt and then say Pravin and Cyril are different? They are the same The commission is an opportunity for the EFF to put their evidence on record. They should bring it to the deputy chief justice. THIS while Julius was part of the corrupt ANC? He must think we are dumb "His family has been portrayed as holier than thou they wont they rather stand outside and grandstand he never produce the facts since gordan touch sars ...malema know the true that is the reason the fighting the guy "Even his inner circle comrades are shook. His defense has only been the WMC media. they know Julius has dirt on him 
14:43,16:57, it is boring because it is using alot of taxpayers money..every body involved should be prosecuted that is true then what was wrong with this IMC? PG is really having problems with black leadership really Too much conjecture about who knows what. The truth will prevail. Bring all/any evidence to the commission. This commission is more like a chat room of friends. Do you believe that the deputy chief justice is bias? Juju is a confused and inexperience politician if Floyd must not be involved with Brian saga why Cr be involved with ANC corruption if not proven. He tjatjarag too much My screen went black "When acusations were levelled against some family members no commissions were established but were instead labelled thugs without evidence. Enter Gordhan 
17:01,18:25, SABC go and borrow a little bit of money from China and sort yourself out. This live feed is horrible kangaroo court indeed Kangaroo court? So what is our best mechanism to come to the truth? Nugent Commission is effective period. someone please speak to ANDILE from BLF to stop this thing pg is fighting "So this Commission lead investigator provided pro bono legal services to Adrian Lackay Paraffin Kortaan must come out clean. zuma and bathabile did say should any member of the anc reveal his\her dirty laundry they will reveal their dirty laundry 
18:34,20:06, The commission reminds me of Malume Joshua Doors interview with CNN saying he doesn't have evidence but jiki jiki 2018 he knows something!! lack of competition leaves us with this rubbish live feed. @Thato M did justice Zondo not address this? the feed is BAD agreed Lucky Dlamini Sunday times stream is clear hey and lacks stop start sequences PG FIGHT AGAINST THE EVIL OF ZUMA PG tries very hard not say anything positive about JZ. NUCLEAR DEAL Is this old white AH the one who helped adrian lackay pro bono 
20:12,21:13, @Neslon i agree with you. ZUMA IS BAD "amazes me that everybody is coming out now @Leshope Gerald did Justice Zondo not address this? "He admitted on CNN ANC is bad The whole ANC is rotten to the core "@Zeno of Elea it was wholly inadequate response one would expect from a Deputy Chief Justice i dont think there is one part that is great 
21:25,22:35, @Sthakathi Khumalo I think he said he has no smoking gun. Not no evidence. ZUMA WAS WORST THING HAPPENED TO US Zeno of Elea meaning?? @THABISO MOGORU i agree with you Can anyone inform us why is this commosion being held at Tiso Black star building? @Zeno of Elea The fact that Zuma and the Guptas got rid of him illustrate to me that he was unwilling to cooperate with them the anc is divided into two parties within itself "The ANC does not deserve the countries vote anymore. Our problem is They are asking him a bunch of easy questions. What a joke. corruption to the core. 
22:40,24:14, one snake two heads @Thato M How should he have responded? He said he has reviewed what he has been given and ruled accordingly. He said if there is more info he will readdress. @Zeno of Elea Zondo's response on the matter will draw him unnecessary criticism. Zondo took sides of the lead investigator without allowing the complainant to fully ventilate their concerns blacks all over the world are paying attention to what is happening in South Africa and the continent. He tries to teach Judge Zondo some English too. "The Sun üåû does not hide behind the Clouds ‚õÖÔ∏è forever someday it will come out  @Thato M that is not true. He ruled after getting both sides and said he will reconsider if more evidence is brought forth. Pravin seem to be avoiding to be cross examined by not implicating anyone but state affairs as they were.He is economical with the truth thus far until proven otherwise The devil you know is better than the devil you do not know. I vote ANC. 
24:17,25:12, "@Zeno of Elea our Constitution requires evidence to be led on both sides of the plaintiff and defendant Prescott Smith and what are white people doing??? Continuing with colonizing the continent?? @Prescott Smith who are blacks? the mandate of Gordhan is to tries all by means to implicate JZ and this strategy is not going to work since judiciary inquiry relies on the principle of res ipsa loquitor. "@Zeno of Elea which evidence was led You cant implicate people with smoke guns hebana! @Thato M this is not a court case. It is an inquiry. Findings from this might lead to legal action "when you look at how the parties act  PG FACTION IN THE ANC WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING 
25:13,27:12, "they act and speak about the country as if it was ten years ago  the ANC is broken into pieces. But who do we vote for???? @Zeno of Elea what are you saying? An inquiry is a rugby game to you "the presidency  guys we need to do research before we listen to people @Thato M I do not follow - re the ref to rugby "so there is some truth to the whole Defending the capitalist agenda "@Zeno of Elea I also do not follow your logic on the legalities (oaths "This state capture report 
27:12,29:37, guys the IMF has warned against expropriation of land without compensation. "This man is pap @Thato M this is an inquiry. Kind of like a grand jury in the states or other inquiries around the world. The investigate if there are grounds for legal action. dave east IMF must go to sleep we are expropriating land "@Thato M If there are grounds to bring charges the IMF is a white institution that lends money and is against land expropriation in South Africa "@Zeno of Elea thanks for the unsolicited legal treatise. Make your point then @Thato M I am trying to understand your position. Are you saying this is not a legitimate process? "exactly @dave east  
30:53,32:53, "is it possible that pravin testimony is the same story "@Zeno of Elea going circles. I was simply pointing out his hypocrisy in dealing with those alleged to have done wrong & how media runs with that narrative "Frans Phala Intresting point yes Khalid @Thato M I see. I misunderstood you then. I thought you had a problem with the process. Sorry "Mpofu will take him to taks Just wondering how Solly Mapaila st al plan to defend PG if they are not standing against BLF and EFF publicly. @Zeno of Elea no stress. i wonder if the KPMG report will ring some truth regarding sars 
33:05,36:01, pity we wont see it a group named the free market found ation was founded in 1975 by 6 white men has said expropriation of land without compensation should not go forward PG FIGHT AGAINST NUCLEAR DEAL...‚Ä¶.. "IMF is the way to go @dave east wow.. why he's on nene issue we already know that he must tell us his own testimony here it comes "Thando Nkutha I saw that "Mthobisi Zuma Nxamalala akanabo ubufakazi lomlisa 
36:18,38:20, Gordhan now goes into the heart of Zwane' shenanigans - the man should have long been in orange uniform by now.... This man is on his way out. He will prove to costly for the ANC in the upcoming elections. His daughter Anisha and uncle Ketso Gordhan business dealings will be his albatross. another group called AFROBAROMETER founded by 2 white men takes surveys has said South Africans dont want land I m not expecting any Zuma surname to support this zone I comm why is there still classified information??? "Manufactured facts that have no substance - you are now clinging on straws chief by implicating his family on feeble claims.....shameless He knows branches and structures of the ANC will be meeting to deal decisively with these matters and calling for the ANC Intergrity commission to investigate while he recuses himself. Days numbered Countries nearby countries must be ready to help should our approach to land issue fail the opposition is cracking the ANC soon or later they will be on the president 
38:37,40:54, "Thando Nkutha‚Äã Battle of two factions bro ANC broke south africa the land issue is going to fail. african eomen are not voting for the EFF...malema said so WOMEN "@Thando Nkutha he is leading the question of the commission Guys is ANC UNITY calls real seen zuma filing affidavits in court to oppose cr decision on moyane "The pace of his speech is telling. Remember this is the chief witness @Aidan Bain your forefather broke Africa Even Baba ka Andile Ramaphosa lols 
41:44,43:34, PG admit that he was a sponsor to Guptas circulating TENDAS TO GUPTAS "Anisha Gordhan my forfather and the ANC - But we need to move on and US fix the past "Who is testifying after Joshua Jamnadas guys im advising you please do not listen to any of these surveys @dave east what surveys? huh "@Aidan Bain we move forward in our terms. We inherited a broken system under the guise of a rainbow nation he from the future 
44:24,45:59, lots of EFF and ANC paid trolls here PG admit that he was a sponsor to Guptas circulating TENDAS TO GUPTAS crime #2 circulating Tendas to Guptas of #1 failed to disclose the 66 emails TO Nana @Obaid Ally agreed! but my sincere hope is that Zodo can help us get to the truth. "There are trolls here zeno look at AFROBAROMETER i have made a video about them. they are founded by 2 white men and are going around saying south africans dont want land "DCD Group which Anisha Gordhan sits on the board provides services to Kusile "Guptas were influential in Eskom expected mentality of ANC and EFF supporters. thick as bricks "WOW so there was NO NUCLEAR DEAL 
46:35,49:20, Anyone been to Pelindaba lately? PMG is also involved in this Fraud they just so f'ing dumb. why did Zuma supporters conceive children ever? Pretorius and Jamnadas are confusing Zondo...!! @Louis Eloff no why? I see JSE top 40 & all share index & seeing lilly white boards and Exco's But despite that THE GUPTAS handled the state well FOR J Zuma other wise this could be the disaster @Thando Nkutha üòÄ what ar ethey saying? Pelindaba where the pigeons have 2 heads "Molefe was smart 
49:22,51:02, Nuclear area @Knight Wolves United FC what are you on about? @Louis Eloff what about it? have u been there lately? lol Wouldn't credit Molefe without mentioning Manuel and Ramos? whew! @Louis Eloff I can arrange a drone to go there in the next hour or so. While the Guptas were in state they took some of the money to sponsor they business through PG i.e Trillion and others Why you think Hartbeespoort dam is dying? Hi pravin are you here again 
51:23,53:09, Nee man you need to send something biological why do people always tag me man sies "Let it die PART OF THE STRUGGLE !?? HAHAHAH üòÇüòÇüòÇ This conclude everything you need to know about PG that Guptas gave him some allowance and ASSETS The commission does not have the teeth to bite therefore this process is a waste of state resource and taxpayers money. Let's allow the law enforcement agencies to execute their mandate. guys this advocate is close to pravin i just researched it malema is right The water is connected underground. once its contaminated a name change wont fix anything 
54:10,56:29, Molefe knew something about Nuclear funding. He was clearly targeted. So sad the country missed out on a 9.6 megawatt electricity plant. It would have paid itself out over 20-30 years But otherwise they have improved South Azania economy during their reign in government state "challenge is that setting up nuclear will take bread of the table of minority coal mine owners 2010 has bring lot of corruption in STATE "but he was not in cabinet on 9 December 2018 PG is really not giving the deep details as to the events that took place Tendas issued fraudly in 2010 South Africa will industrialize further because of joblessness. Factory workers and unions are here to stay. Molefe should apply to question Pravin and to give testimony. His view on nuclear is interesting. Pravin says Molefe could be right because he was schooled by Manuel & RamosüòÇ. 
56:52,58:39, "@Louis Eloff will lead to a mass exodus "How could it be self funding though  this is a waste of time....TRC .....da wil com There's a lot of health concerns in that area. just Google it you will see. nuclear damage cant be fixed "Gordhan is talking about fear when cabinet memebrs @Trucker I guess that is one view. "@nkutha "If there were no funding models finalised for the nuclear build PG just stop wasting people timeüòèüòè‚úã 
58:44,1:00:18, @Louis Eloff so what needs to happen then? "@em D "ANC should have sacked Pravin long time ago Declassify and expose the truth to the public. @em D but that would mean we should allow a private company to build a nuclear power station here and sell that power to the state...(grand scheme) PG really is waisting our timeüòè You 100% correct Thando @Louis Eloff üòÄüòÄüòÄ you are joking. "@Thando Nkutha I think we are getting close to a hydrogen energy matrix soon too 
1:00:32,1:02:16, @Thando Nkutha absolutely "I wonder why SANs are anti Nuclear energy "Apart from difficulties in managing nuclear waste and terrorist friendly "He told the Judge to connect the ""DOTS"" Lolüêµ" "Haha "@ Khalid Mather the UK is building more nuclear plants with South Korean companies The London trip were he was recalled We thank the Guptas for thanking over the J Zuma admin(for he was Ghost) but we regret THE FRAUD DONE BY THEM TO THE STATE TO BENEFIT THEMSELVES THROUGH PG "@Sthakathi Khumalo in the new stations there is no considerations for even weaponizing the waste 
1:02:18,1:04:56, khumalo you shud.get a job in the London palladium telling jokes Here come the truth "Oil  We thank the Guptas for tAking over the J Zuma admin(for he was Ghost) but we regret THE FRAUD DONE BY THEM TO THE STATE TO BENEFIT THEMSELVES THROUGH PG those guptas owned Jacob and his son and even his wives We have the massive coal reserves. Which countries / economies have the highest Co2 emissions? "secret forces drafting ""memorandum""." even the youngest wife that's why she is pregnant lol I See the anc splitting 
1:05:06,1:06:09, @Kevin Davis same way Anisha Gordhan is owned by Stephen Koseff this is Zuma s highlight the intelligence report lol "Khalid Mather Just think of this in the long run May the peace of ALLAH be with you I'm just worried about the DCJ coz he seems to tbe agreeing with whatever Gordhan is sayingü§î thato lol take your evidence to the commission all of it all zero pages of it MALEMA HIS CORRUPT "Gordhan reallly likes Twitter Blackpoison Bp Pretorius and Joshua confusing him!! 
1:06:16,1:07:30, So PG and His close friends were the only one clean the rest were corrupt LOL IS THIS GUY BRINGING INTELLIGENCE REPORTS FROM TWITTER? IS HE SERIOUS? atleast the truth will come out trucker zuma has a opportunity to cross examine but he wont "He is such a coward "@trucker "@Kevin Davis not until you submit yours. Wait not until Gordhan provides something concrete to the commission "Folks there is no Intelligence report that is TWO pages Viva President of United of Africa Commarand Julius Malema 
1:07:40,1:10:50, zuma will only say after all this nobody implicates me at all so I am not worriers @Kevin Davis ZUMA DOES NOT HAVE TIME FOR GAMES. HE WILL COME WHEN INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE IS PRESENTED. I am embarrassed by minister pravin gordhan thato lol you are dead the emails the intelligence report and all the meetings will all be unchallenged trust me really all the witnesses are lying lol even all the money he received from Roy Moodley he says was a gift that he forgot about lol "Yes thato if a tone believes they are false and even a large amount of minister said they are true they are entirely to give evid2nce with there version but wait for it malema calls pravin a dog. pravin has never spoken bad about malema at least in public. who is fooling who ? 
1:11:14,1:11:52, THAT IS TRUE malema "@Kevin Davis what is a tone nobody I repeat nobody besides the guptas have said so and the guptas are refugees lol Gordhan has smurk on his face and its really annoying malema looted Limpopo Finances through his ill contracts with ANC when he was ANC youth league President till SARS dealt with him now we cnt say malema is Smart LOL DID THIS WHITE GUY REALLY CALL THIS EVIDENCE? i didn't realize thiefs can take so long to go jail i think two or three for testifying for corruption is enough but this noooo as tube get hold of saa 
1:12:02,1:13:42, viva EFF WMC!

If he were any of the African leaders "@Kevin Davis time wasting. I'll tell you fro free 
1:15:34,1:17:17, @Kevin Davis therefore your argument and rationale falls flat. Over 8 departments already confirm to have given Pravin‚Äôs companies tenders since 2009 when he was Finance Minister. @Tharp M only knowledge you have is white so were going to court when the commision wraps up? @Peter Sant were you meant to tag me or nah? thato but if one reads out the emails and the person or persona mentioned in the emails say they are not true then they have every opportunity to give there side and cross examining the reader however zondo he is wasting time and gov resources wen this will end let the thief rot in jail finish I think this should have been dealt with in court if nobody does then the material.is regarded as correct hope that explains that 
1:17:26,1:18:38, yes @Thato m yes @Kevin Davis you are still on emails. Chief. You need professional help.

It's not a news source. "@Thato M I would rather get news from Twitter than ENCA. Also @Thato m why always you attack white people? @Walter Spatula Give me the real sources and stop wasting my time. "@Kevin Davis no you wouldn't be can't they just do tea what what while addressing waste of time "Probably too late but at least all the Cadres chicken's are coming home to roost. Never in recent history has so much dirty laundry been put out to air. I'm enjoying all the ""popcorn moments"" üçø" @Thando Nkutha Horsesh!t. Twitter is the source of much fake news.

1:21:29,1:24:33, @Walter Spatula Stop running your mouth and give us the real sources. @Thando Nkutha Then you will forever be misinformed This commission is a COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. It is serving it's intended purpose. That's why a whole full grown minister can wave a two page fake Intel Report in front of a judge. Its so shameful @Trucker There are no real sources for fake news. That's why it's fake... "@Peter Sant becacuse you are here claiming moral superiority when the banking @Thando Nkutha You mean BFLF? going back 200years there is enough wealth inthe country to steer 56million south africans ...if not we must nationalise...just look at on financial inst "@Trucker What can I say?

WE MUST TALK ABT RACISM UNTIL ITS RESOLVED. DODGING IT WOT SOLVE IT "Can PG please name that ""Person"" he mentions was so devastating between 2009 and 2017" Eh.... war President who? please say the name sir "@Ewald Kruger hypocritical. We didn't do that for other families. The commissions isn't the be all and end of dealing with the issue. Pravin must be dealt first PRAVIN WASTED 3 DAYS ONLY TO TELL THE COMMISSION TO CONNECT THE DOTS!! there we go he has just implicated zuma 
2:09:37,2:10:36, Racism is rife throughout the world it starts with our kids.... they will resolve it... but we must give our kids a none racial upbringing... the existing racists you cant change them "THE NUCLEAR DEAL WAS THE BEST SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEM "Are there we go He must mention name please "AS A BOT @Thato M‚Äã@Ewald Kruger if you are insinuating that the then President would've sight over all SOE deals üòÄ Tell me why waste your time here if you can't grasp what's being said??? Pravin is wasting time and the commission's money "@Ewald Kruger this is a political terrain 
2:10:53,2:12:01, Nuclear..... lol Julius made money from the Nuclear deal Why is this JD spending the valuable time instead serving the nation - putting the puzzle together @Ewald Kruger just put your points across man and engage. We will name call when we are done on materiality of arguents PRAVIN IS A WASTE OF TIME *arguments @singhashon have you been listening to the testimony of PG??? nuclear deal never happened... still on the desküôÑ and SA is running out of coal Thando think of evidence and testimony he laid bare how rules were flawed in running the government by the administration he served under. The comm is not gunning for one act by one person 
2:12:51,2:14:17, @Ewald Kruger explain the rationale that a political contestation must be taken to the Commission as Gordhan alleges? Please tell me on what basis this should be done "@Thato M‚Äã@Ewald Kruger just put your points across man and engage üòÄ I made my point "There was a State Capture. The golden question is ""Who are the players of state capture??""" @singhashon I hope you heard that the nuclear deal never happened! including him.. chair what could they have done to prevent it "@Ewald Kruger and that is supposed to a logical @Edward Buta ASK PRAVIN. "em D  jail the thieves 
2:14:22,2:16:45, "I thought ""State Capture"" was a surecase thing and clear evidence was available that's why Zuma was oust... why are people being asked to come forward with evidence ü§î" "Key moment "Can someone that will reveal it all @Thato M yes Pravin is a wizard who sees everything Thando @Thando Nkutha my point exactly. The entire national spend "@ singhashon but you have ideas of who made money in the ""DEAL"" WHERE do you get that from so we can also go read it up?" "@Thato M‚Äã@Ewald Kruger and that is supposed to a logical @Ewald Kruger what are you saying? What are you arguing? Say it. Let's engage 
2:16:57,2:18:44, the media told us that we should march against Zuma... there is clear evidence of state capture... 9 months down the line nothing has happened... was it just propaganda to oust Zuma? intrested i think Pravin is not naming names because if he does.... there is a gun waiting to be offloaded this state capture inquiry is a clear sign that ANC will not be governent 2019 "@Ewald Kruger don't tag my responses @Thato M I am interested to listen to Zondo. lol Pravin is a frontman fo the Ramaphosa cabal/faction it's not different from the NKDZ faction/cabal "@Ewald Kruger great 
2:18:56,2:19:53, EFF WILL COME BACK MARCHING IF HE TELLS ALL lol Pravin Gordan is a criminal... finish en klaar biggest lie and manipulater must be fired so dat he can be let out the truth "Mpho Mashigo I would imagine that the people who suspected didn't have the necessary proof - only heresay only those disillusioned will think that this fake inquiry will work no one will be implicated and s.a will continue as business as usual "sorry The ANC failed to prevent state looting because it was divided and senior members were directly involved esp the head zuma with guptas. The aim was no more transformation but personal gain "and that the ones who had proof 
2:19:58,2:20:57, PRAVIN IS THE BIGGEST MANIPULATOR "This whole things reads much like aSteven King novel How did Gordhan reach the R100bn losses he purported to have caused the country without citing financial flows or atleast one contract? Pravin is right ^ Was it a thumbsuck? "I AM A BOT I AM HERE TO SHOW U THE TRUTH ABT YOUR COUNTRY "I think where Zondo is going Pravin is to say pravin should be ashamed to use duplicity to hide his agenda 
2:21:23,2:22:25, INDIANS WERE TRANSPORTED HERE TO SLAVE IN SUGAR CANE FARMS BY WMC ‚ô• Zondo üòÉ "@Mpho Mashigo That's what I was thinking about also WMC!!!!!! It's been so long. @Keryn where's proof of his allegations? We must just take his word for it? Unfortunately Anisha Gordhan is heavily involved and he didn't disclose this. His words are empty rhetoric! "Pravin is not a hero he is anti-hero yey... Pravin fired Dudu Mnyeni for telling the truth in the SAA enquiry... she said Pravin has shares at Bidvest and it's a supplier to SAA making billions a month at SAA and the Indians improved their lot considerably since then... per capita they are the wealthiest people in SA despite apartheid. "@Ewald Kruger I see you are sidestepping. When all else fails 
2:22:49,2:24:14, But why do not we hear just one instance where Pravin warned or acted against state capture within ANC stages at all. Why is it not because he was also its role player as well WMC!!!!!!!! @Wilhelm5381 in your view blacks and Indians were treated the same? Muppet! The Question was what did he and the ANC do when they discovered state capture. ANSWER is Mantashe's Diagnostic Report a few weeks before the ANC elective conference. So this was all politics that was not the question pravin WMC!!!!! wmc? Pravins Nephew has a business that leases planes to SAA... the Same planes that use to be owned by SAA but sold of... wake up people... PG is the State capturerüò°üò°üò° Vote ff+ for a prosperous and corrupt free south africa!! 
2:24:21,2:25:19, your mother is a product of WMC... what bull... ANC must boot him out. He is not a man of integrity! Kettle calling the pot black @ Lufuno Mudau I think he didn't hear the question lol although we heard it lol Thing is Pravin wants to distance himself from the rot of ANC But he too has contributed to State of Capture RACISM IS A PRODUCT OF WMC this will be the norm if ANC is elected back into power "SAM The country owes pravin a massive debt of gratitude GERMANY IS TOPSüëè 
2:25:42,2:26:36, Viva FF+ coalition with D.A @Mpho Mashigo Floyds brother has shares in 4 companies that provide coal to Eskom.... from the earlier ZUma days PRAVIN HAS DONE NOTHING BUT GIVE US A LECTURE @Walter Spatula for enriching his daughter over millions of people. Afriforum and DA will thank him. futsek Arrest Pravin Gordan mahn he is the one who captured the stateüò°üò°üò° wake up people EFF and ANC are fighting each other through populism we know where this has happened and we know that it ends with violence why don't the blacks purchase black monopoly capital a d brand it "@Thato M Nope "THis is not even a lecture since a lecture is substantiated with facts 
2:27:01,2:28:44, @Mpho Mashigo it would be really nice if it was just 1 person who captured ... easier to fix @ Mpho please bring evidence EFF is playing games @Walter Spatula a criminal standing for another criminal. Your logic is amusing! Pravin Gordhan endorses Cyril Ramaphosa yet the current president is the most secretive state man we have ever had. This man's ethics are unquestionable "Jesus It is political error to think that EFF and ANC can deliver to the masses of south africa Pravin testimony is not so direct as expected by many; he simply stove to exonerate himself from ANC mudslinging but he shared light on state was incompetently run 
2:28:47,2:29:26, "Anybody with a brain can see that @Kevin Davis  ANC Intergrity Commission must move with speed to deal and look into the allegations of a multi millionaire daughter. Lack of useful facts and names. EFF ARE THE FUTURE "Pravin Gordan gave Ivan Pillay R24mill hand shake at SARS. stole R72bill at SARS... now the want to ""Privatized"" (Steal) SAA..." lol LOOK AT OUR VALUES Diagrams at which compounds? "@Thato M Fake news 
2:29:32,2:30:41, EFF it's worse lol Can't wait for the cross examination. Hopefully we'll hear more legally useful material and not politics PLEASE DONT PRIVATISE Vive la difference Notshi... "@Walter Spatula political contestations aren't fought in a Commission "True "EFF IS THE FUTURE lol 
2:30:53,2:31:47, lol Failing by pravin to share light on his own flaws or weakness on state capture leads one to think that he is here to build his own personal standing in the society PRAVIN IS ALSO ADVISING THE COMMISSION "Under cross examination playing victim won't help... Public Protector is investigating you Pravin... you going down... pravin your words are rotten as like your integrity "True notshi lol what will the eff do if they lose there tobacco smuggler WHY DO PPL VOTE FOR A PARTY WHO STILL HIRES 70+ YEAR OLD PERSON 
2:31:58,2:32:53, EFF and ANC fights simply give FF+ and D.A opportunity to effectively fight corruption A practical manifestation can simply be named right folks. TELL us who's now attacking the commission? Hey this guy Corruption will never end in this country HOW CAN A CLEAR MINDED PERSON VOTE FOR GRANDPA "@Lesego Pitsoane ""Whiteness"" is not an insult" "Juju o tlo mo tlhasela gore it's wrong to associate whiteness with riches He talking politics in a commission.

PUBLISH ALL SUPPLIER CONTRACTS AND INVOICES AND LETS SEE STATE CAPTURE WENA üò°üò°üò° The fact that he is addressing these factional issues here are testament of the balance of forces within the ANC. if you vote ANC 2019 you are also an enabler of corruption "ANC WONT LEAD NEXT YEAR pravin said he never had a meeting with the guptas that's what he said a d he never has nothing ever changed So what must we vote for Sam? cant wait for Dali to question PG "What evidence
