Is Dr. Ben still an IFP Member? How can replaces a suspended with a suspended #Eskom is a circus It’s not about eating curry but it’s about what it will make you do... mbalula ate curry but it never finished him 🤣 when is Ms Memela returning I have a crush on her legal counsel Ms Mbanjwa Dr. Ngubane is ANC😂 "meet the new boss remember the fee state dairy case..the choir went to india.overate curry..had to run back to S A

"@Bandile "@Bandile Hadebe the war room is not a place it is the name given to a small group of high ups who were tasked with getting Escom back on track It seems there is no love lost between Ngubane and Tsotsi . @Nemabubuni Geoffrey 😊 Did you see #AdvGerrieNel representing the first accused at the bail application of the 3 policemen accused in the Julies case. Gerrie Nel would have fun here 
41:29,42:41, I heard him saying that chair . He is changing his evidence Mr Tsotsi..

And you have a soft spot for the ambassador - we see you😝😝 it is very hurting to see hie people like Ace were playing a big role in facilitating this corruption but it is hard to catch them right-handed... this is very concerning
