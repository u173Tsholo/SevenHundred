So under Mbeki the main drivers of the jobless growth was largely due to commodity price boom. This is usually spinned incorrectly 
1:10:19,1:12:11, How can african women be fighting FEMENISM in south africa against black men when we men arent in control. patriarchs control land jobs and money and white men do this we black men are poor? Greg now u start fighting while temperatures r cooling down "this state capture bull doesn't matter when black people are still suffering and the minority still own everything sowwy These peoplle should be extinct üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Greg u like fighting man hahahahaha From Tomorrow the scrutiny of the EFF thuggery begin...PG off the radar now the real corruption gets serious attention right @lee 
1:12:13,1:13:52, "Waste of tax payers money. This commission is much a do about criminal bullshit. when one minister is in handcuffs nah - humour lads - thats it All land in white hands must be expropriated without a cent. Viva #BLF viva are there any african women here @lee royal it matters mhlobo wam because remember the 50billion budget shortfall last year was highly politicized. The SARS commissioner who rained in the large companies in gone now "No the EFF and BLF is a miscourage of the ANC "@Thiza William Jeez When Juju is asked about the new expose. Unlike him to refer to the journalist in a humble manner as sisi 
1:13:59,1:15:25, "the land is the only true form of wealth not only in SA BUT IN AFRICA @Vusi. Even if I bought it from a black man? At the price he wanted? @SAWIE @dawie botha R450 Bil to 2 trillion 2015 i will never accept a dime for the land my great great grandfather fought tirelessy for never woman I feel like I like this guy. Everyone switch to the investigative journal Daily Maverick expose which runs an excellent driven evidential journalism 
1:15:28,1:16:53, @dawie botha You just nailed it! Its true! "people can start appreciate what mess apartheid has placed SA under. it looks better under whites SAB WAS SOLD TO ENGLISH WHITE MONOPOLY CAPITALIST FOR R1 TRILLION let ANC keeps corrupt cents i will keep my land. All of it must be taken Greg can u give ur young sister Ayeye EFF!!! Hi Thando @ Dave talk to me 
1:17:07,1:17:58, "under apartheid SAA "@Thiza William I was there a Daily Mav offices last week Dave lost his voice "@em D it may matter but legacy wise we need land like it or not we cant be working for white people for ever the private sector has more money lungaisani are you a black woman @Sam how much did u buy that land white monopoly capital - black majority corruption - which is better? No land for setters here in Africa we are soon expropriating chief.... @noko yamebetlwa )$ 
1:17:59,1:19:34, yebo dave why We are all black in this chat WMC is just a bedtime rhetoric by confused black nationalists "@Thiza William Theirs was that "Sam Vanguard COZ THEY WERE SERVING ONLY WHITE PEOPLE N WERE NOT CAPACITATED FOR 55MIL CITIZENS Sam u got for free it was going hand by hand hahaha lungisani How can african women b fighting FEMENISM in south africa against black men when we men arent in control. patriarchs control land jobs and money and white men do this we blackmen are poor? CC @lee royal true. But also a treasury DG who is hard on big business is very important. Not some cat who is a puddle and soft on business who avoid tax. 
1:20:38,1:23:23, @dawie botha You think both EFF and that crazy group of BLF (about 20) are a miscarriage of the ANC? "qeustion to ""land looters"" ie eff why is niger and mali cityzens runing away from their own farms to europe if african depends so much on ""land""" CHAIR IS VERY MICH AWARE OF MASHONISAS LOL KWAAAAAAAAAAAAAA If you get something for free you don't appreciate its value Vusi. I understand and agree with you. What was done in the past was wrong. But what are you going to do with the land after you get it how so thando This chap from treasury is impressive yes he knows abt Mashonisa even my boss at the farmer used to do mashonisa to us @em D Do you think tax money can help the whole of SA ? most black south africans think that if you own land you rich or going to be rich that was the lie most black zimbabweans believed and now Mnangagwa is saying we want white farmers hahaha deplorable 
1:23:57,1:25:43, @Fick bring it here u will see what I will do with it man I used to stay in the farm with ur elder I will use it @lee royal I think tax money is one of the transformation tools available for government. There are others of course. And I understand that you are angry. you have a valid reason. But after you get your appropriated farm. who are you going to direct your anger at then? "farming is delicate it's not going to orlando stadium and watching soccer it takes knowledge Mnangagwa is a timebomb "silly question that always annoys patriarchs control land money and jobs . what do south african black men control for black women to fight us for? Sam Vanguard but that is wrong though. We want to participate in the economy when we seek land for shelter and sustain a living among other things The EX has follen 
1:25:45,1:27:10, workers at farms are black to work on a farm and run a farm are two distinct endevours Sam u never done farming bra Black were doing the job Dave east are you obsessed by black women? I wish as many SAns as possible follow Fuzile illustration as is vital for society to know why they are in such economic level.Think of surplus and deficit please "@em D THE MINORITY OWN SO MUCH LAND @noko yamebetlwa ok then from your perspective hahaha Noko it is true that there are knowlegeable black farmers but are there any money lenders who are prepared to lend them as the goverment are just helping themselves and loot the bank who are supposed play with private property you will become zimbabwe and wallow in poverty 
1:27:12,1:28:41, help them Fuzile made a mess of everything "@Nelson Musoliwa He lives the treasury strategies. I know myself @lee royal I agree with my leadership. But today lets focus on this one because its also very important. black south africans should be clever not to take heed this expropiation bullcrap we all know who will suffer Was he fired or did he resign?? guys its a serious question. if we ss men dont control anything why would our women be joining femenist groups to fight for womens groups but not for pan Africanism we must learn to be patience because farming is not predictable. it's not like getting a tender today and get paid tomorrow even though the site establishment has not been identified. poopoo time
