time,18:48,message The witness has both Zondo and Hurley around his finger. he is controlling they should also have a body language specialist in the commission to see weather this idiot is lying Roy Kirtsen we all can see he is lying!!! "The witness knows his story  I thought this was not going to take long.....Nyathi has verbal dihorrea Martin you that 100% right "No wonder nothing happens in government """Everything I did wasn't actually me 
19:23,22:44, collective irresponsibility witness has an attitude üò° this person is arrogant Sounds like he did no work at all. Arrogance won‚Äôt work here he must answer So arrogant! "As Shaggy once said Dodging questions and showing arrogance Zondo must put him in his place 
23:18,25:38, Gupta @Craven Morehead - hope the syncing is better here üôÇ ! THIS MAN HE IS ARROGANT BECAUSE HE HAS GIVEN A CHANCE TO DO SO Looks a lot better the enca stream is horrible @Kerry van Schalkwyk yes it is. The lies are the same though This man is acting guilty as sin. A bit hot under the coller Sir? @Peet Venter Very Hot! üòÖüòÖüòÖ "scratching you head does not change a lie into the truth 
25:44,29:50, what an embarrassment to have a person like this in a senior government post. He has nothing but contempt. The fire pool guy is so arrogant because he knows he will walk Scot free from this whole thing. He is protected by Ace and his gang. "Apologies @Marcus Mmola this is not a court of law clearing your throat so persistently is an indicator of lies. As a police fundi you should know this but his style is working for now @Marcus Mmola It would be such a pleasure to see the judge walk over to witness and give him a snot clap whenever he wastes time or doesn't answer a question properly... afternoon fantasy. hehe NO GOAL THIS GOALKEEPER 
29:55,32:34, This Nhleko is ducking & diving & Judge Zondo is being too accommodating. Zondo knows who pays the bills The Chair protecting Nhleko @Alvino Theunissen how is Zondo protecting Nhleko? "Does anyone know who was in the ""reference group""?" by not letting the ADV completing his questioning and hurrying him up what a bla bla bla cover up I think the chair is doing well in directing the proceedings no guess whose side the chair is on? 
32:35,33:53, Deflect all the time!!! Again with the stupid jokes.....eish Clearing throat is a sign of not telling the truth as his throat starts tightening up. The police service is a joke Correct @mohapi mphatsoe He's trying to creat rapport between him & Zondo & then pull the wool over his eyes. I sincerely hope Zondo can see through this!!! Zulu to Zulu jokes??? Agree @ Kerry van Schalkwyk joking time is gone longtime ago 
34:06,35:26, What is this chit chat about really? Body language says this guy is lying his ears off it's all a parody of truth..... Never forget the trillions that have been defrauded from the South African Tax payer. i can go to the circus @ Hein de Wit ha ha ha. yep you got that right He continually will not answer the question in a straightforward way!!! This is really irritating now & I'm getting angry. Time for being civil is over - answer the bloody questions Was his water blessed by the so called Doom guy? 
35:41,36:45, trying to get Nhleko to tell the truth is like trying to draw blood from a stone @Mohamed...he is not actually intelligent but diverting it @Gift Mazibuko - absolutely agree "DCJ is very strategic they cover each other trained by the Chinese Principles of ANC compromised the organization. This things could have been avoided should they interrogate their political appointments and the manner in which decisions were made. And we have not even started on the Secure in Comfort report yet nobody will go to jail 
36:47,39:52, unprepared lost time and money Zondo comes across a scared of him Why can this commission not deliver interim reports so that the NPA can start prosecutions? parody of truth.... "It's also very frustrating for the evidence leader zondo is protecting him @Cerebis It's frustrating. I wonder how Nugent would have handled this commission. @Dominic Przybylski Jip! He would and did issue interim reports in the SARS commission. 
40:55,47:01, "The Media i.e SABC Lol now he sounds very guilty these characters are paid millions tax money.... "they all belong to one organisation  "what a comedy actually it's very sad lives for lunch You can hear that even Zondo is bored with this long-winded testimony! Zondo is not a cadre. He is only doing his job albeit lethargically 
47:15,48:57, "Africa guys The nonsense on this platform questioning the integrity of DCJ Zondo because people do not understand legal processes is shocking this is just an excuse to waste public money More friendly chats RESPECT ZONDO........he is on top of his game Can we get back to work? Really Zondo this is wasting time This is really a comedy of errors! They spent most of the day sorting out the pagination instead of getting on with the testimony! Now they are talking about food!!! I can't anymore. really??? This is a commission not a court 
49:03,52:04, "Why is Zondo trying to play nice with this guy @Mpotseng Lebentlele - I agree but he needs to be more assertive now & enforce Nhleko to get on with it & answer the questions directly. it's a tactic to get him clear no shame useless to watch further @Gabisile Mahlangu how would you expect DCJ Zondo to behave next he will be accused of not being fit to be a judge as did Lucky Montana @Kerry van Schalkwyk I hear you and trust me he is about to corner him i believe "talk  Perhaps Zondo should be wearing black leather with chains and a sjambok and give the witness a whipping every now and then. 
52:04,55:06, @Mpotseng Lebentlele - hope so üôè "carefully  "it's useless I wonder how many trees this commission has used up with all these files? @kerry van Schalkwyk you have your own perceptions of how DCJ Zondo should conduct himself care to share this process is not just to punish but to save a state from capture... it should be done accurately to a microscopic levels. sad... "The land of thieves and reports and cadres  Why hide when nobody ever gets prosecuted? 
55:43,58:10, lock them away they still the money and try to reconciling. ww want economic freedom . lock these people awy am I the only one that thinks this guy is an idiot? @Bophelo Malapela - I think he needs to be more assertive with Nhleko who has been ducking & diving to avoid answering to the charges. Just swell up and explode on custard. Nice This process is even better than that of the court of law @kerry van schalkwyk define assertive @Siseko ... that's exactly why he is giving long winded strange responses He seems to have avoided doing any work or taking any responsibility at all... Now that's not a crime but surely this kind of person should never be a cabinet minister. "@Bophelo Malapela - if you don't know what assertive means 
58:19,1:02:20, watching from Namibia akore ke nulle ka sesotho sa heso lenna hobane le yona ke puo :virtualhug: "@Mandy Phillips but all what he says will then be used against him in the court of law... No matter how long is his answer @Kerry van Schalkwyk it wasn't necessary to patronise @Bophelo Malapela like that. @kerry van schalkwyk from your meltdown I get the distinct impression you have no clue why nhleko is before the commission What law "2nd report indicates a revision of 1st report. Then obvious question is ""Why has the report been revised?""" @Bophelo Malapela - not at all. It is merely a question of him guiding this witness to answer the charges succinctly & directly. Nhleko is skirting the issues & we the tax-payers are paying for it. 
1:02:37,1:05:41, @Mpotseng Lebentlele @Bophelo Malapela - I won't dignify those comments with a response. Le ya tena wa tseba he must just say he doesn't like to read It‚Äôs nhlehos own problem is he refuses to answer questions as that might comeback to haunt him MC bride is going to eat him So did you ask that question Mr Nhleko? Bivouacked on the brink of reason Nhleko is here responding to allegations made by McBride against him he does not have to give answers we like Mr just jumped into the pool coz his master was about to fall 
1:05:50,1:12:31, @Kerry van Schalkwyk i agree hence its ok to put your argument across and still be respectful. I'm confused. Is this an inquiry or a court proceeding? Has Nhleko been charged with a crime? Humor me please? Let‚Äôs watch and learn. The fire pool has no relevance here No way can he defend this smoke and mirror decision he took at the time yes. impersonating a minister "@Mpotseng Lebentlele - agreed & I was not being disrespectful @Hubert Maphumulo that's called murder. He executed directives from his boss and made reasons as he went along. They were not going to tolerate any resistance to their masterplan "@Bophelo Malapela McBride won all those allegations 
1:13:30,1:20:15, lost the subject "McBride came to the commission and alleged that this issue of reports and werksmans attorneys was State capture All in can conclude at this point is that we deserve better public representatives than this guy. He hardly seems to have applied his mind to these matters while minister. "Does he realize the diff between the truth and his version of the ""truth""" lol anc get taught from early to lue and deny and the president will do the rest Dramat and Sibiya lost their jobs because of this renditions nonsense. Sibiya last week won his case in labour court & wants his job back He knows exactly what is truth and what not but he will never admit his part in the masterplan "@ Bophelo Malaphela you stated very well Lie and Deny everything......cause there is just too much at stake for these Commie ANC Cadres.....true ne 
1:20:21,1:23:25, he must stop duck and dive McBride was accused of doctoring the second report he also must answer Isn't it winter down there? DCJ fresh shaved That gas bubble from Nhleko was a lie coming up @Bophel McBride is coming next month Hey @Hubert Maphumulo we have Trump here. Absolutely no leadership and no morality My fear is that only the small fish will fry.........they will be the Fall Guys etc.... "I am aware It seems he plans to bore everybody to the point where they no longer ask him any more questions without the danger of dying of old age while in the same room. 
1:23:42,1:28:05, "@ Bophelo Malapela McBride will come as he promised but minister must tell truth coz they traumatizes people as we see poor evidence to all cases it‚Äôs because of this action by minister The Commission will NOT get him to admit to anything. He will duck and dive to frustrate and tire them. Agree both @ Wendy @ Makhosi So what were the renditions that this learned gentleman is speaking of Unlawful operations of allowing Zimbabwe police to kidnap Zimbabweans & take them to Zimbabwe where they were killed This is the same guy that said Mr Zuma need more money for Nkandla Rendition of 3 Zimbabweans back to law authorities in their country """All conditions for SAA rescue plan have now been met @venecia Moore he had to sing for his supper
