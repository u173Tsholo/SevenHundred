This guy can decieve us without fearas at all "corrupt people Are we going to adjourn at 3pm again 2dy @Bronx Wavy Absolutely. They must amongst many others be prosecuted to the fullest. 
4:41,5:10, cal Brian molefe fo help Isn't it a little strange that other people have a memory but he doesn't? Perhaps he needs a brain scan or psychological help. am wit u bronx...... but he can remember tht who was trained to b a spy when he was 19 yrs old mxm stupid tactics 1k only the rest is not interested in ubaba kaduduzane anymor "I was looking forward to this week thank you pastor and kagiso beloved?! hahhha but he can remember spies

It pains me that my life as a resident of SA was in the hands of this lumatic "White people still owe us why theirs so many complains theirs so many ppl who hv been here "Your problems never go away I think we need more mental hospitals for those who support this man 
6:47,7:37, innocent is Zuma's Xhosa name We back! Zuma should know how a guilty person behaves afterall he was an MK Interrogator. @Bronx are you a fan of Julius Malema? I do not know what is to interfere Breaking: Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has just announced that the Dept of Water & Sanitation is in a state of collapse @goolamv . I believe u bro. everything about the EFF is fake. phumzile tell us you don't like money? He is now part of his legal team👏👏👏😀😀😀🔥🔥🔥🔥

8:54,9:39, is really cracking and is getting angry @Bronx are you a fan of 'superior' logic & ideals of Julius Malema? He understands but his problem doesn’t go away 😂😂😂 😂😂😂 Perhaps he should spend a month at Valkenberg for psychological evaluation. the vultures are circling ubaba😂 Wahi hlamarisa.A vanwi pfaleli "this is waste of time and money for this With a surname like Beakus I think not 
9:43,10:33, “Listen properly.” lying can only go this far😆😅😁😂 @#Sibisi we need answers dude yes henk he's cornering himself SOUND SABC Let's be clear there are no differences between Zuma & Malema 3rd repeat Zondo Puppet or not he has alot to answer for.

11:14,12:00, khuluma baba Speaking of oneself in the third person is a sign of narcissism His legal team has noticed that his answers before lunch were self incriminating "Tebogo....if there was no differemxe "This Commission is to establish how Zuma and Malema are both low IQ delinquents. Peas from the same pod TRUE BRONX......THEY ARE USING HIM AS A SCAPE GOAT...... Could it be that JZ is feeling the heat "ya neh fmr pres thabo Mbeki has said "" you replace me with nothing""" 
12:01,12:24, Agree with Simon "He thinks he order the commission now i just wonderwhat his going to say about des van rooyen. i dont know this fellow😀 "@#Sibisi if Zuma uhamba nabo ejele Intelligence Report mayifike.

12:58,13:23, I just love DCJ's patience. Can we move from htis #Hogan issue....I thni we have heard enough and we are getting nothing from Ubaba indeed @andre My point is Zuma must not worry about what have been said about him; let him disapprove their evidence but stating what he knew to be what actually took place This man is angry...He does not want to go through the details because he answered the question he didn't want to answer😂 "@makhosonke kunene you and me both.... that's why Pretorius is going through the ""process"" so much. Zuma is going to have to try and subvert the ""process"" then" Parliament is becoming like axtavern with physical threats a daily occurence with the EFF now they didn't coach him enough!!!! Remember Bab Zuma this is a Judge uzakufaka kwemnyama itrongo

He’s trying to wiggle his way out of this. Notice how he sips on water whenever he is cornered iyhooo here is my 2cents - His lawyers probably told him he will have to stand up for himself now - because they (lawyers) are being restricted by DCJ Zondo. hehehe @Ntokozo we do not care about his Zuluness or anger he must just answer the question 
18:00,18:26, I believe most of us are lost in this commission "tell them baba  Zondo is treating Showerhead with kid gloves !

It was discussed at lunch and this was so preplanned. This is no different to what has happened in trials already examined or not he must just tell the truth story end there 
25:59,26:32, which one is the black guy? "they must subpoena him correct Zuma knows how this will end....just playing along BUT ZONDO COULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS DELAY... TRUST IT...ZUMA IS F**ING WITH THE COUNTRY I'm waiting to c malema to Zondo his lawyers are now desperately trying to get him out of testifying... @Gerald Beukes there's more than enough evidence against zuma Now ZUMA had no power they are trying to discredit this commision. 
26:33,27:13, they are going to flunk out 😂 innocent until proven guilty otherwise who can tell me now Zuma knows very well that Gama is being sued by Transnet for R166m that he and the Guptas stole through Trillian and zuma fainted Zuma is scared of telling the truth 😀 @Pramodpatel Pramodpatel. 👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼 Welcome to South African politics friend🙏 "CHESS GAMES What is Zuma afraid of ? 
27:14,27:38, Zuma we want true wena madala @ Noor Davids most definitely - there is lot said about him. He needs to give his version so that evidence can be corroborated Free lawyers aint sounding free... @Gerald Beukes 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 shaya !zuma my president Zuma is being judged with or without skhakhane All those people who implicated can't lie all of them. Unless JZ is saying they are part of the plot to remove him he has to respond to what other witnesses have presented. it is not his version only that matters. it's a comparative scenario. 
27:42,28:03, He is giving up the opportunity to prove himself innocent - only conclusion can be that he is guilty. Too much evidence makes a guilty man scared. no evidence against zuma wena Geze hlekisa uza phuma utshaya i feel that he is afraid of contradicting himself Zuma elchapo Free My Black President.!!!!!!!!! All evidence against Zuma is hearsay. No documents with his signature. No videos no recordings...…..NOTHING there what in Africa 
28:03,28:18, They want to save Zuma at all cost....where is Gaddaffi money? Gerald. what planet are you on? This commision is one big joke This liar is making a mockery of the word Oath "Sikhakhane uses flowery language that really means nothing remember every chapter 9 instution and all the arresting authorities are watching and listening to every word and everything is now on the record i zuma refused to provide a statement Guilty ...guilty...guilty... "Zuma is clearly lazy to read Put him in jail if he refuses to testify. 
28:21,28:37, "ppl listen to the last seconds of the first sessions ul understand wats happening here live zuma alone ......his giving them the correct information and he won't go to jail "if you're not guilty "Pretorius has been nervous the whole time because he knows skhakhane stop been stupid 2.dis guy sold us Zuma can not understand that it is too late for him to run nor to hide; he must just face it up and account va tlanga hi hina lani let cross examine pravin first then zuma later we all know black people cant be corrupt or racist its impossible 
28:46,29:31, Goliath thought he has won the battle but David defeated him.Thats what is going to happen to Zuma .he will never have peace till he die "Scary how many of you have seen what he has done to the country but still turn the blind eye if we cee evn the mouth of soil is tening in zero secondary "Zuma is going to take the easy option out as he always does Ay Zuma. You had the chance to show us you can defend yourself🤦🏻‍♀️ now i give up They brought this unto themselve it will resume at 3pm... Pretorius must ask those difficult questions if he has nothing to hide he would have no problem answering this madala realy dont use the apportunity he has been given. always runs around. 
29:45,29:56, "he cannot sing now Zuma innocent we are the scatterlings of africaaa hehehehe Got to laugh at all the “useful idiots” still defending this crook. "Seems they want to control his answers "Are we still trying to establish facts in the commission Hey guy could you tell me Zuma was doing well before Skhakane argued.But now tell me if they don't comply with the commission they might face the tougher version with the Law. 
29:57,30:24, I've missed a part. What is happening now? madala is smart Racist bunch all of you Exactly Tebogo V he cannot sing he has to talk if he is innocent then There is no problem...only liars and criminals need lawyers to bail them out Cross examination happens to someone whose version is already given This Commission must move to court. First time to face the music and he chickens out .Can only deduct that all said at commission about him is true. 
30:33,31:20, slyza tsotsi skhakhane love money.stop dfnd bad guy for money "Exactly "Enough about Zuma "THEY WILL GIVE ADV P ALTIMATUM phunyuka bemphethe Zuma needs a machine gun it seems. "@Hein Schreiber . He is going to empty his 25litre bladder 😂😂 "zuma will crack 
31:26,31:55, Zuma is just wasting our time and money once more and just got us watching this channel for ratings wil he make it by the time we get to pravin's and nene The hot seat In fact his I don't knows and I don't remember have already incriminated him whre is adv maleka ppl saze sanya yi-white monopoly capital no1 is running. the law is being observed here no games Enough of the kid-gloves. If he acts like a criminal treat him like a criminal. Dont forget Sikakhane was CEO at Denel who wanted to sell SA arms intellectual property to India...he is also a Gupta /Zuma deployee 
31:55,32:32, "i've could not said that because the were so many reports Guys I can’t hear a thing.. are they live?.. i agree with you Gerralled to is to much racist in country @Sifiso Dlamini answer to that will be I don remember if you have nothing better to say keep quiet Every time they get caught stealing they cry racist. Pik..pik...phekeek.... Thought there was some hope for this country but the idiots are still sleeping Always playing the victim and are always not involved. #zulus 
32:33,33:07, All against my President are spys Pretorius must go harder if he has nothing to hide he will give his version @Karabo Faith the sound is off until 3pm Not live break till three. ay lomama uMagda ngathi wazi kakhulu😏 Zuma must come back. There is a lot he still needs to answer for. Chicken leader...of chicken party. BaBa is not coming back Zuma doesn't take us serious 
33:12,33:49, the commission has turned the corner no more angazi i cant remember i dont know "Ss saun  @Karabo Faith. Zuma asked for a break cause he feels pressured to answer questions this was planned "@Sithembiso Mzondo ...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 then walk out we back yeeeey Atleast the white man in bosasa admits he was wrong. Andre Coetzee Where does Zulus come in here? whre is baba phunyuka bemphethe 
33:52,34:17, Guilty ....guilty....guilty... Why does corruption have a colour? zuma ain't a coward he will surely come back shisa impepho baba!bathatha ma chance If you steal you steal He knows he'll be proved a liar when confronted with specific details. what happend now? what did i miss ? i am Zumas sangoma any queastions?🙊🙊🙊 "Zuma is now crying in the back room 
34:18,34:35, @siboniso siboniso truth hahahaha. Thanks @Henk and @SsSaun "It's best that he goes Zuma is not going to continue with this enquiry. Judge Zondo will have to Supbeona him to the Commission in order to proceed. yesterday zondo got fed up and stopped too early. he can't come back zuma "But Zuma has said nothing to be honest ngubani longebi He better than all the presidents Sa ever had 
34:46,35:20, Chicken yellow coward.Just like ANC in struggle. "@Nobuhle "What do you want him to tell you @Pumeza Mnguni are you drunk or stupid or both a political giant as zuma cannot be crucified by a commission he himself put into place... @Sithembiso Mzondo ... this is another trick of allowing him to calm down... watch should they decide to return he will be calm as ever provoked to the last degree It was Zuma's lawyers that insisted they adjourn early not Zondo. shocking - he comes in guns a blazing expecting everyone to believe his version playing the victim card. Now he is playing his usual delaying tactics not answering anything truthfully. # NOTTOTRUST 
35:23,36:06, sthakathi u are not all of us I want Gerald belies to stand up in public and make himself known not hide behind an anonymous profile picture "It's innocent until proven guilty. besides they haven't presented any evidence against or implicating the Former president. it's been been a he said Let the cowards withdraw from the process All part of the broader plan to discredit the judiciary. absolutely PLANNED ZUMA ZUMA ZUMA 🤥🚿💰Zuma 🙈🙉🙊 If he doesn't come back it is 99.99% certain that he is guilty. Beukes make yourself public. 
36:11,36:34, "It's not like he enjoys the privileges of provocation alone we were really on autopilot 4 9 years We must unite against this crook faction. Sthakathi you wouldn't say anything if you were also asked about other people's thoughts and reactions Zumas lawyers are doing their job. Unfortunately they don't get paid to please us. They just wanted to go finish LUNCH Boswell Wilke Circus is in town again! "X..x  Zuma will go and sing his machine gun song to his few supporters and maybe talk too much. 
36:37,36:54, Zuma was not a king of the Zulus he must account HE'S 100% GUILTY FFS Nyama was LEKKER😂 IF MR BUTTERNUT IS TELLING THE TRUTH WHY DID HIS LAWYER GET SO LIKE A HEADLESS CHICKEN ? Strange that Zuma said the Judicuary is not captured but now he wants to discredit the commission ZUMA MUST FALL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "so much privileges on the inquiry: 1- Monday he talk nonstop & no Question for over 1hr "nhlanhla nkosiExcept you of course "He’s still talking in the 3rd person 
37:02,37:43, x.x. you can also take a shower there is no commission in the bathroom the will come back by 15h00 You can run but you can’t hide !!! the media is captured by the masters of WMC hence why ppl they always taking a certain position they can not draw their own conclusion by has brain wash them particularly the whites and the few blacks Zuma is falling. publish your profile Buekes..or are you the coward that you support "His actions had dire consequences on the fiscus he can't just run away like that Steve Van Niekerek uneminciza eno sukela phathi @Sofia Sofia he was CEO at Denel and heavily implicated himself 
37:51,38:27, ZUMA RAN AWAY Let's bare in mind that this is more about corroborating what was said vs his version of events. It is not cross examining when asked to give your version for the record. #DEFLECTING will there ever be criminal proceedings after this? i doubt 🤷🏾‍♂️ "The questioning is approaching a critical point with regard to the testimony of Ms Barbara Hogan. As a Minister then Get the Blue lights outside Zuma coming home 🤥🚿 Zuma will be subpoenaed just met Zuma at OR Zuma refused to give a version and refuses to comment on the version of others zuma is not falling but the country is falling to wrong hand of wmc 
38:29,38:56, we need clean governance end to corruption if zuma falls many others will be named too...he wont go alone "@Sifiso Dlamini I think we should have all ex presidents here "lets be honest "I expected something like this Running scared the coward. Orange overalls before the end of this year for him. True @Nomvula @Gerald Beukes What are you smoking? Can I have some? skhakhane is really trying his best to stop Zuma 4rm talkin. 
38:56,39:53, "Gerald @Magda Seguin he was involved in everything - even thou he don't know his alphabets and numbers a-Z all are corrupt! Banesizungu. WAIST of time and WAIST of money for tax payers zuma and trump. best dodgers out ter Beukes stop white facing! Zuma destroyed any future SA may have had. Its all down here from now 🤪 publish a photo of yourself so we can all see this supporter Beaukes "i think now his lawyers make an appeal of Msholozi must not go through in details when he answering the questions @Joseph Gumede waste so what will happen if he doesnt come back at 15:00 
39:58,40:39, And he will always have blood on his hands "Henk  Agreed @Joseph Gumede . Nothing going come from this like all the other commissions. Not even one charge after how many years?! What is the financial state of Transnet today we lobe baba and how much hatred u have against him Zuma exposed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! COWARDS The lawyers see that he is not recalling anything and that makes him guilty they want to pull him out but will he live the commission? "Phumla 
40:39,40:53, Dirty old MAN It's becoming more evident that JZ was a passive president because he clearly cannot go into any details of any sort because of fear of incrimination. #BS @Sithembiso Mzondo ZUMA MUST DROP💣💣💣💣 yes...personally i want to know why De Beers has 100yrs contract of mining i really don't understand why people like zuma wQm. i really really can't understand it I think Gerald Beakus is Jacob Zuma "The crook's back is against the wall. He's increasingly desperate as it's clear that he's lying through his teeth. The commission should proceed Gerald Buekes is Zumas propaganda machine 
40:58,41:36, 你们好 No one will be arrested. WAIST of time Zuma exposed at last. We don't hate Zuma but we hate his unthical & corrupted character zuma is innocent until proven guilty """waste"" of time" "we are all corrupt in our places 大家都好 be vigilant! 
41:49,42:21, Zuma is close to 80 ngeke nimbuze nge document ya 2009 mase nifuna engasho ukuthi I don't know angikho crc. Leave all this proceedings and nonsense - move to court. Charge formally and let the evidence or lack therefore speak. yes Josepg gumede and tax money waisted *thereoff THE RAND is diving further: R15.66 to the euro today @Philos Masina Very sad statement you just made.

43:39,44:09, ZUMA IS GUILTY . FINISH AND KLAAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm wondering how crimal charges and cases will be implemented if Judge Zondo finds that criminal charges need to be opened against corrupt individuals "ruling party wil never lose It was supposed to be 3 minutes...my guess is it may end here @Sithembiso Mzondo ...lets review contracts from all SOEs back dated to 45yrs and see there arent any corruption from previous Gov "guys you must remember that this is a commission not court guys if it court they were going to judge him  Can Zuma recall all his wives?? People who are ignorant can't be leaders. Zuma was a mistake to be the president. His supporters must up to reality. life is getting difficult 
44:16,44:41, "censored Zuma is arrested ababoshwe😁😁 ayika pheli yini i 30 minutes @x. .x agreed :D haibo ngiyabuza - W-HE-RE -IS - ZUMA!!! KUYIWEPHI? "Zulu nationalist PROPAGANDA is dangerous "I don't know about Jesus coming "Because he knows the truth 
44:45,45:13, 7 mINUTES LEFT We had a senile geriatric for a president. Forgot alles. I like this commission Mr Zuma you were not working you were looting and putting your cronys in place where they were in cahoots with the guptas and had done grievious country harm to our country with out regad to your oath Zumas lawyers are confusing the commission with a court 14:50 """waist"" = line around stomach. ""waste"" = use carelessly." Zuma is arrested.agree does anyone know how you can do business with zuma 
45:16,45:36, i have a proposal izophela ngo 15:00 "All of you condemning Zuma So funny Gerald aka Zuma What a coward! Mduduzi Zuma thinks he's on Trial 🤣 so they 🚀out the room "Gerald Beukes had to only memorize 1 line. Well done i guess Tebogo is a born free coz these days born free they have lot to say about struggle icons you no idea what these ppl went threw fo yo to speak the way do today "All I want to do is Zuma zoom zoom in my boom boom 
45:41,46:30, Gerald how can you say such? If Zulus were committed to this country IFP would not be among the top parties in SA Derek... Coward unyoko "@Martin De Beer be patient with the process Guys is the commision adjourned? very soon this chap will fake a chronic health condition... "Im still busy blocking the Zuma supporters @ teboho no Old man is tired

Fake Chronic? @Phelelani Gambu u mean fake his own death and still walk the streets @Thando Nkutha Exactly - more ducking and diving. We're used to his cowardly running by now. someone will be arrested somewhere lol "Well Tony NZ I cant remember😂 😁😁😁😁Zuma zumas defence lawyers have failed to prepare him adequately for the hearing.Using i dont know or i cant remember as a defence was poorly thought; did not negate allegations against him. 
47:43,48:12, I think towards the end of the day the Muti fades away ..... I hope he takes the right decision here. A president for 2 terms and you do not remember anything. This man needs to use this platform to say something clear and to the point. I for one do not know what he knows and it's been 3 days. and by the way the Sipho Maseko Zuma rejected is what in Black Consciousness we call a TOWER Doc recommended holiday in Dubai will cure cough 🤥🚿 no need to force former president something he does not remember 😀😃😄 @Born free uyanya When will they resume again? Please help me @Magda Seguin hi 😀 
48:19,48:45, 15:00 @Lwazi Silolo Are you saying Zuma was a spy? south africa is a failed state RESUME AT 15H00 @asanda right decision for who? you? Tebogo reminds me of apartheid times govt of whites tried to turn blacks against black it dd nt work seat Thank Michael. lol. som ppl r soo desperate to watch this 
48:51,49:06, "I suspect he will not cme on Friday 3h00 heheheheheheheheh PAY BACK THE MONEY Hi @rohan barnard how are you? zuma wil say nothing Sipho Maseko is a product of Black Consciousness movement thus a tower I.e he ascribes to the highest ethical values in service of his community Are they teaching him ABCS? or 123's? So long ! habaswe bana ba baloi 
49:13,49:32, Jabu Malinga I am one of the people he serious case of alzeimers when it suits him @superbus it's been a failed state since forever.. Zuma is a stooge of Guptas IS SKHAKHANE DONE he must demand his money from that inyanga. the judge refuse to sleep on his desk . his or her prophesy did not come to pass. Molweni uphi uMsholozi? Ngundozandoza ityala lamawele yazba iyakusiphathe nina lengxokolo ingaka 😂😂😂😎 The only thing we have found out is what JZ doesn't remember. We do however know that he does remember things quite clearly which happened 30 years ago. Is perhaps symptom of smoking too many zols. 
49:36,49:51, hey Gerald Buekes we want you standing outside the commission venue with a placard supporting so we can see who you are.. By the look of things DCJ Zondo will be coming to indefinitely adjourn the proceedings... "Jabu zondo wil decide who is lying. he wil make recommendations and zuma wil go to court . another 10 years wil pass. zuma wil die and then? all this money? Toilet but who introduce the Guptas so what if he doesn't remember a document that was given to him 20 years ago 🙄🙄🙄.... vele akasakhumbuli uNxamalala. dom soos n plank "If he backs out now 
49:51,50:17, A President of 9 years cant account for his tenure...tragic I guarantee they are done with the questions and Zondo will have to issue a subpoena. Criminal movements hang them Tokolosh is chasing Zuma. innocent until proven guilty "whoever told Tebogo ""uyanya""beqinisile😎" they r not coming back "two minutes to go pay back the money and a full JO-JO tank of water ! lol 
50:21,50:55, zuma wil not answer Sandile Fakude that goes deep "Check Sipho Maseko's background he is a TOWER he is too clever for that Zuma's lawyers it was their strategy before he attend the commission to interrupt the chairman so that he must lose focus. You cant force an innocent man to admit guilt Zuma is not coming back... I can assure you. The chair must use his powers and subpoena him to finish his testimony qha. Only the guilty is afraid of giving testimony either zuma is lying or Barbara Hogan is lying. take your pic.. 
50:55,51:20, so was bill cosby so he had the time to bore us for three hourssss on Monday. ? Zuma said the Guptas are his close friends and nobody can do anything about that...they deserted him and is having multi million dollar marriages @Thando Nkutha Yep - he can see he is trapped and wants out. Zuma will be going to Dubai very soon. this Tebogo guy is in the payroll of Rupperts you see that he is talking media politics zondo wil not supena him Return Flights to Durban from R 600! @Rainy Moodley In the case of Zuma it is and must be guilty until proven innocent. the allegations are overwhelming is it not? 
51:20,51:44, So what exactly is he here for? Coz everything here seems to implicate him in some way. I'm struggling to understand which questions are appropriate for this man THEY GOT US HERE WHILE BUDGET VOTE IS ON they wil not force him to do anytin. I reckon the people who support Zuma here probably work for Sahara Computers and benefited from all of it. 😀 zondo is neutral goino gonna He is walking his walk to freedom and will never come back again Ama Gupta madala kumzabalazo they have pictures with almost all presidents that have lead this country including Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. zondo cannot act in 1 interest over another 
51:46,52:20, has Zuma been charged? last i was here it an inquiry what is going on people i bet you mofos that Zuma will not continue hahah this 30 minutes is quite looooooooooooooooooong Why its impossible to bring guptas into this inquiry? Statistically Zuma is guilty. There are so many other charges pending against him. He can't be innocent of all 100. "When things gets too hoooot They must allow him to spill the beans first and then do the questioning after. Time is running out zondo wil hav to do what zuma wants Dubai - The quick sprint to freedom. 
52:20,52:37, watch the space the lawyer has advised zuma to abandon ship. its 15h00 @Nonto Ngubane Not yet but he hasn't done himself any favours. are we on break or it's just my internet? Jngle Pssy somehow I think you are right Bring back the Scorpions. why guys you forget zone7 sebokeng "I am a disciple of Biko and Sobukwe @ Jabu: Why? 
52:40,53:01, "if zuma does not want to answer Zuma made all those who implicated him out to be liars...he is pathetic playing the victim.He ruined the lives of lots of honest folks and messed with the future if generations to come he is going to come back and say I AM BRAIN DEAD Skhakhane tried to discredit the commission and it backfired Zuma must go and live in Dubai. He will just be remembered as a traitor to his own country. jigggga maaan wuddd uppp "yazi nam weNjabulo Zulu Nationalism is dangerous no mores 
53:05,53:29, Spot on Jabu! he's liar jz because he keep on saying i don't recall @Jabu Malinga That's right - the judge will make a decision with or without Zuma's input. @Sofia Sofia 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #zumememoryloss "zondo invited zuma . he did not com by force Zuma and his family are booked on a flight to Dubai .The Sangoma cant get him there but the Tokolosh can . due to emmidiate effect Zuma has decided to leave ....looooooooool When do you draw a line and say some one is lying? @Tebogo V i assume you support the EFF because they claim they have picked up Biko's and Subokwe's torches 
53:30,53:48, "its not the lawyers who advice  @Simon Davies..I so wish he can take his family and move to Dubai and bever come back Mr I don't remember is not coming back tebogo indaba yokho leyo what time are they resuming???? Tebogo V u a not desciplne umdlembe wena ungaphoxi amaqhawe ezinkokheli it's now 15h02 and Zuma hasn't come back HAHA TonyNZ time to panic 
53:51,54:08, "typical ""I didn't do nothing and know nothing""" "No he must be made an example of. Once Zuma goes down This commission has a pre determined outcome to blame everything on Zuma "Bad Bews every now about familys no net cut las names the commission can now make findings even if zuma does not answer Zuma is taking us for a ride. he is guilty uBaba is running away now ZUMA REJECTED SIpho Maseko a TOWER who was groomed in the BLACK Consciousness movement to always be ethically upright 
54:09,54:32, he is busy wiping clean his hard drive Dankie Henk @Thando Nkutha Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. WILL WE SEE ANOTHER WATERKLOOF LANDING IN THE NEAR FUTURE? "zuma has his opportunity is Pres Zuma back? and I just DUZZINT know "It's all over Coward 
54:35,54:46, Remember people Monday he was not feeki its 3pm now where are these guys indeed Madga. He won't be safe there either 😉 these are not criminal proceedings but what he says could be used if there is a criminal case opened what is this commission intending?..the man will never incriminate himself/accept liability/take accountability but will definitely shift blame & blame others..let him&his attorneys withdraw. Zuma is doing what we expected him to do on Monday.... run away. Zuma must rot zuma won't cameback. thoses 
54:51,55:11, "its now 15:04 For Sale 🤥🚿 ZUMA T-shirts "ANC is corrupt Trust the Commission process. Those who diminish and disregard it do so at their own peril. Love or dislike of uncooperative participants is irrelevant. Is the commission back? guess we going to take another week again next week 😂 Y'all Zulus are victims of IFP ideology that killed people in Boipatong & Thokoza Next the judge will supeona him. Both ways he will have to come an testify 
55:13,55:34, "why is the commission in the business of cross examination of witness who has been called to provide information....... now the commission is cross examining him We the people against Zuma and his crooks are the majority. We must unite .....now is the time. he will come for adjournment hes late @Zuko Sirayi I'm with you. Elikhehle lingu Zuma liyasi jwayela manje never comes all of u must wait for Zuma end if he's not coming back u not goner do nothing zuma cannot use the same tactics and still survive. never he will be in a radar sooner than later.
