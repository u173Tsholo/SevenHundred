33:44,46:44, If SA was not a fools' paradise; Molefe and Sigdn should have already seved their prison sentences. Obviously the two guys are extremely rich Bribe is killing South Africa Thando you are right i just exaggerated a bit because of being so disgusted by the law enforcement's lack of acting on these state looting me mo.. a me mo ðŸ˜ƒ Beneficiaries of state capture are fighting back thatâ€™s why you malusi gigaba back in Parliament @ Thando Nkutha it is true what you are saying all departments are busy cleaning up systems and correct procedures to be followed Thando if we were a rational and functioning state state looters should have been isolated from a society taking into account billions of rands lost in SA 
53:17,1:08:49, Ramaphosa was warned by the World Bank to clean up corruption or no more handouts. That is the reason Eskom has taken a loan of R70 billion from China because the World Bank does not support corruption. President Ramaphosa is tightening up loose screws and allow prosecution flow in a fast way coz no reason not to finish with investigation and prosecution of those who did wrong Ace Magashule said commission findings are not binding telling himself publicly which he lied to himself once the report comes out NPA and tribunal get in to charge those finds doing wrong batohi she is going to do nothing about this situation course she is there to protect there corruption of anc comrades how much money did Nedbank make out of all these deals as well? "kenneth dont forget ramaphosa its also corrupt my comrades yes my comrades 
1:10:03,1:16:39, the gvmnt needs to build MORE PRISONS for these culprits including MAGASHULE and his club "@ Luvuyo Zantsi I am appealing to all South Africans to support Ramaphosa "makhosi @Mk maga gaming ...government does not need to build more prisons..... they just need to put bars on Loot Freely House... all the big crooks are there. Let not forget fikile mbalula is also fighting for the ANC and the President that is how crooks operate..they do the dirty tricks first and then try to legitimise the act later.. "the ANC acts as a collective "You know any way we can wait another 25 years neðŸ˜“ 
1:16:46,1:20:25, "@Funani Manzi Mbalula is not fighting ANC and President what he was doing what boggles the mind is when it comes to building mere proper toilets for school children there's no money! it's unforgivable!! why is the wolves coach testifying "Cyril sat and watched corruption happening and didn't do anything (for years) Now ANC voters are leaving To be honest speaking Ramaphosa was most popular than the party going to elections coz our party leaders were too much painted with allegations of corruption though they donâ€™t accept that Banks and law firms not smelling of roses in this inquiry.. no it's not Luvuyo! not when the ANCWL comes out guns blazing in support of her! "But if thruth be told @makhosi Sori my bad he is protecting the ANC 
1:21:01,1:24:19, truth is we will never see a single high ranking corrupt politician in long jail stint in our lifetime. I thought something was done when Shabir was sent to jail too ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” I don't understand how Judge Zondo's glasses work. When he reads he takes them off?? please do maybe I can see things differently. @Pheladi Lamola ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ please! @Luvuyo Zantsi I can give you many more names of cadres who are corrupt and nothing has happened to them. "I only know of Block State capture in SA is just like economic terrorism and i wonder why no actions are taken by law enforcement agencies or is it still captured as well as Booyzen alluded to "President Ramaphosa in his head knows exactly what people want 
1:25:13,1:31:11, @Felix Muyoba I can't see a thing without my glasses. Especially when reading ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. So I need help in understanding the DCJ. @makhosi nobhatyi then for next five years citizens should not expect anything on service delivery since the president will just be busy fixing the parrty.. ok Luvuyo that's 3 names. go on please... Ok. Understood no Luvuyo Shabir is not in jail ! "@Felix Muyoba service delivery is a part of duties Makes sense. Thanks Thando. I counted him at no 2 Luvuyo. Zuma and his Comrades of corruption have alot to answer for.. and if Zuma refuses to testify at COI then he will answer in a court of law where he will face justice. 
1:31:27,1:36:13, "not really @ Thando Nkutha he was given medical parole "I think am with President if there is no more looting and corruption there will not be protesting "Tsotsis have been voted back in We Demand we demand we demand.. just don't destroy please! "Val Speirs  if you aware then why are you saying he did his time? where? let's be honest with ourselves with what is going on here @Thando Nkutha It's still the same ANC - corrupt to the core at all levels of government. yes he certainly presented himself as the dumbest President ever.. but he will pay one way or another. "like I said 
1:36:31,1:45:21, "@Val speirs exactly they think are clever wants to be followed procedures that is what president is doing @Luvuyo Zantsi OK - let me correct that then - VERY FEW corrupt ANC cadres are charged for their crimes. "yes@granny. Zuma had the help of Julius Malema ""I will kill for Zuma to be President "" "ofcourse they do Thando "@Thando Nkutha No - that's not what I wanted to say. I contend that at all levels of government "@makhosi nobhatyi Aaah - so when it suits the ANC @Luvuyo Zantsi Not at all. The DA like the ANC use the collective responsibility argument to escape accountability. "this is so ugly taking into account that we sit with a massive unemployment @Thando Nkutha What is the difference between ANC and ANC cadres? I'm not saying only the ANC are corrupt - but they are more corrupt than most. 
1:45:40,1:49:04, "@Derek main remember ANC sends no one to do corruption so we cannot defend corrupt leaders @makhosi nobhatyi The ANC has become a patronage network of corruption. @Thando Nkutha Semantics what makes me angry is that people like Nomvula are still on the list sometimes I wonder where we would be if the very effective Scorpions were still here. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” @Thando Nkutha The ANC does not exist without people. "@Luvuyo Zantsi I think the DA are just as corrupt. If they were in power I didn't hear about it Luvuyo. I would blame the whole DA if they protected her and do nothing about it ! @Luvuyo Zantsi So exlain to me what the ANC is without the ANC cadres. 
1:49:15,1:57:30, it is not the DA that is sittting here it is the same party people of the ruling party i just if anybody can calculate the whole amount that went into zuma and companys or cronys pokets "@Derek main if you listened to us here we are not defending anyone who did wrong @makhosi nobhatyi Yes - I hear that. My propblem is that you seem to be in denial at the extent of the corruption. @ Derek main I understand your frustration what I am saying is that we are taking ANC out of Derek main pocket by doing that you would Identify problem not a party but individuals behavior @Thando Nkutha You should take off your rose-tinted Ramaphoria glasses. We have been hoping for a better government for decades now. The same tired old promises are rolled out every election. @makhosi nobhatyi You're still missing my point. There are so many corrupt ANC cadres that it's difficult to distinguish them from the ANC brand. It's a cop-out. @Luvuyo Zantsi Are you giving up? it is now beev reported that SARS have colected a very big amount under the alocated target set against the national growth and this has very dark consoqeunces for our country a shortfal of billions @Thando Nkutha I know what the solution is - get the ANC out of power. 
1:59:32,2:07:54, @Thando Nkutha I have no option but to accept it. I will still say what I have to say. If you don't agree give me your view and we can debate it. @Thando Nkutha I did my bit - I definitely didn't vote for them. @Thando Nkutha Do you seriously think the only issue of concern is who Cyril elects in his cabinet? Witch the country can not have aforded in a sense this means dark days ahead (eskom) and bad growth means more unemployment acumalating into more crime and south africa are heading for the end @Thando Nkutha Like I said - I have to accept that but I won't shut up. @Thando Nkutha That's just the cabinet - they can only do so much. What about the corrupt at municipal level? What about the corruption at SOEs? What about the corruption in the NPA? It's endemic. @Derek Main I was reminded that I must be aware that I only represent one vote the ANC would lose. The ANC won without my vote. I know they will be worse this term but I have no escape. Maybe 2024? "@Thando Nkutha If I see something I don't agree with @Norman Zwane Yes - same here. I just thought my fellow SAfns would have more sense. 
2:08:49,2:12:06, @Thando Nkutha You're not trying to suggest that the cabinet is involved in appointments all the way through government are you? All these enquiries are a waste of time ! Nothing will come of it ! The same thieves are still going to be sitting in parliament ! @Derek Main I think the stand against the ANC is just so desperately fractured. I have no idea how it can be brought together. Wish I knew how coz the ANC are still going to waste a further 5 yrs "@Thando Nkutha - there you've just hit the nail on the head. It's a top down problem. When corruption happens at local or provincial level "It results in a mistrust. I didn't vote ANC because they've had their chance. They've blown it HORRIBLY @Thando Nkutha My opinion comes from a place of wanting clean government. "we offer 100% job placement in our youth development 
2:12:44,2:17:31, "We should accept that anc is cleansing itself after completing our workshop training for all south africans 18 to 25 "@Norman Zwane Exactly - we'll be asking the same questions in 5 yrs time (and getting the same empty promises). I also wish for a new ""breath of fresh air"" party." I know there are enough like-minded SAfns who want the same. "@makhosi nobhatyi - the only HOPE I have left @Thando Nkutha You seem to forget that this bunch of miscreants have been in government for the last 25 years. @makhosi nobhatyi Since the elections - Zandile Gumede is sheltered going to public court; EC gov swindle R12m off the back of the Gift of the Givers; Cyril re-appointed Zuma's premiers. Cleansing? *fools @Thando Nkutha That's a lame excuse and you know it. 
2:18:44,2:20:20, @Thando Nkutha - oh my word. And up until now I was reading your posts and presuming an intelligent individual. Then you chose to bring up that drivel. Pity truth is they chose the ANC Luvuyo. i am so sad that there is no salution as C R has not the political know how he is listening to the crooks in the seo and parlement as a anc token to be president there is little he can do "@Thando Nkutha If you're happy to wait 300 odd years for things to improve @Derek Main We are failed by the opposition lack of leadership and vision. The vision to unseat the ANC is proving to be too narrow to succeed. people chose to stick with the devil they know Thando Nkutha after 25 years the ANC cannot live without apartheid or racism as they useless in what they do @ Norman Zwane Who is Zuma premiers appointees? Why do we not just sell out to china and get over the loss of the freedom you have neen fighting for so long 
2:21:39,2:24:49, @Luvuyo Zantsi @makhosi nobhatyi They are premiers who Zuma appointed. We are fast learning that Zuma only saught to appoint proxies which is why these are regarded as Zuma's premiers. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY UNEMPLOYED YOUTH WITH A GRADE 12 CERTIFICATE WITH MATHEMATICS OR MATHS LITERACY. "THAEY ARE ALL INVITED TO SEND THEIR CONCISE CVâ€™S The National Health Laboratory Service( NHLS) is offering exciting opportunities of a 2-year fixed term Medical Technician learnership programme. @Thando Nkutha The ANC is cancerous to SA right now and by demanding that they should step down is not bringing up the past...IT is something that needs to be done now for SA to continue as a Republic "@Norman Zwane I agree - if only we could have selfless civil servants and not rock stars in government @Thando Nkutha And yet you refuse to acknowledge that many of our problems today lie at the feet of the ANC. "@ Those premiers are not Zuma I really doubt the ANC really got a majority to be honest...Just look at Durban and PMB right now...is that how people act who just voted for the same corrupt party? 
2:24:57,2:28:16, @Luvuyo Zantsi It's a bit like finding people who will admit to supporting apartheid - you can't. Same with Zuma supporters. @Thando Nkutha Do your damndest mate. @Thando Nkutha What's your point? just like the truth is ignored by the masses @Luvuyo Zantsi So millions from the public purse is spent on Ramaphosa Inauguration but R100 million less than that spent 5years ago when Bossasa was involved. Ramaphosa should just be sworn we have a crisis in SA. "Derek you lost election @Thami Ngwenya I didn't lose the election - South Africa did. "@Derek Main you failed to unseat the ANC @Thando Nkutha I've already told you my solution. 
2:28:41,2:31:35, @Luvuyo Zantsi Honestly?? @Luvuyo Zantsi That's what people say when they can't argue on the merits. Viva The Masses must excersise birth control because it is not the masses that pay tax but a minority of the public. "10M have spoken @Carnoth Ngomane Wishful thinking. I'll continue to say it like I see it. Viva The Masses are looters and cause mass destruction. @Thando Nkutha Keep trying to convince others to vote them out in future. @Thami Ngwenya It will eventually. Viva The Masses Demand and Demand but where is their contribution to the public purse?? 
2:31:45,2:34:40, @Derek Main just try and get more support maybe just maybe next time you will realize your dream since you failed this round every single person who voted for the ANC approves state capture and supports corruption @Carnoth Ngomane Yes - I accept that and I will keep trying. The fools who voted ANC will soon realise the error of their ways. Not until 48 years "â€‹@Carnoth Ngomane I do not think @Luvuyo Zantsi Did I hurt your feelings? It's called The Gravy Train. @Luvuyo Zantsi You're an ANC apologist. "@Luvuyo Zantsi Which claims do you wish me to back? Your sloganeering is not debate 
2:34:59,2:43:02, "Black Empowerment is obtained by ""Success Fees""and not by skills or qualifications." "@Luvuyo Zantsi Unfortunately @Luvuyo Zantsi You want me to educate you through literature that the appointment of Premiers in the Zuma years was heavily influenced by Zuma to make those elected his proxies? @Norman Zwane you are right but it also doenst give you a platform to rebuke to who doesnt share your sentiments "@Thami Ngwenya I always find that a ridiculous argument - so because it happened in the past "No I'm all for exploring that and punishing the guilty but that doesn't mean we should ignore what's happening currently. What about the past if you are really concerned? anyone who tries to justify corruption which should just be called theft just sounds ridiculously stupid. 
2:43:51,2:48:36, WOW THIS IS HUGE !! point is kids are falling in pit toilets after 25 bloody years Maan!! "No one who justify corruption "even if it was one flushing toilet nothing is being done to do away with corruption...if that was true the ANC wouldn't be in power today "@Carnoth Ngomane Free speech allows me to exploit every and any platform to raise the alarm and spread my views. It does not however allow me to slander Should this ANC government return to what it knows and does the most.. corruption.. then all taxpayers will pay their tax into a private held account and not that of SARS. "Lets give context The public sector must have oversight of all government expenditure. 
2:53:05,3:01:29, "@Luvuyo Zantsi Read Khulu Mbatha's UNMASKED (Why the ANC failed to govern). ""It is ideology "Ramohosas business  "@Luvuyo Zantsi Read alsoPrince Mashele &Mzukisi Qobo's THE FALL OF THE ANC. ""The ANC has gone the opposite direction by devoting attention to empowering a tiny elite which is factionally connected.""" "Not sure ANC fail to govern "The ANC is incapable of reforming itself. It has reached its limits "the only way out is to get yourself educated "Not sure what you are talking about @Thami Ngwenya Winning an election is not a sign of an ability to govern. It is just that. Winning an opportunity to govern. as for our generation they've stole our futures and sold us dreams of a better life. 
3:02:38,3:10:02, We choose a party because of its capabiliy including governing. My future is not stolen "1983 @Thami Ngwenya There is prosperity the other side of survival. People want to prosper not survive. The poor economic leadership by the ANC is what has led us into a dead end economically. Has McKinsey return that money to Eskom or was it just to put wool over the public eyes? *Returned "you said it "@Thami Ngwenya Too many things to mention but a few are no charges against people who refused to testify at Truth Comm Anoj Singh is the one who was Eskom treasure failing to answer Gordhan questions at parliament according to the financial rules Tjooo him and Molefe sell these entities to Zuptas Prosperity requires hard work endurance and focus.It is not an automatic button. Our people will succeed be patient. Talking like the world has come to an end 
3:14:15,3:20:55, @Thami Ngwenya Not under the ANC it won't. Only the elite few connected individuals will get massively rich. @Thami Ngwenya Your lecture on hard work is wasted on me. I do not share your optimism. That patience is poorly reflected in the daily protests we see. Seems the people are not that patient afterall. telling people to be patient is testing them really. how many graduates are out there unemployed? "Why they voted 10m  @Granny Mokwena It is selfish. @Thami Ngwenya Because they once again fell for the empty promises. "Dont speak for them @Thami Ngwenya You seem to have missed the earlier point that the opposition let themselves down by not offering a common destiny. The ANC is helped by the own goals the opposition scores. @Thami Ngwenya That is the only explanation I can think of. Otherwise why would they vote for a party that is so heavily implicated in corruption?
