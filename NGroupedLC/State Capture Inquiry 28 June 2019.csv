1:34:21,1:35:02, he want to frustrate anybody Knowing Mr Mahlangu he is not stupid but because of the exposed corruption he did he is acting in a funny way simply bcoz he has no place to hide and no answers can save him h h h h hence @Thami Ngwenya I just know from my own experience that I did not succeed until I learned to believe in myself (self-esteem). "Here i quote the great Magashule "" He is innocent until proven guilty""'" if it's standard why did it not form part of the terms and conditions imagine trying to negotiate with her for ukuya emajiteni perhaps the best this to do was to come clean and speak the truth to the commission he disappointed his entire family. I'm sure he will never attend family gatherings from here on. Yoooo iMALI route of all EVIL 
1:35:13,1:35:50, @Biza330 this is what you get for being Zuma's friend. "this guy had a night to talk to his lawyer simple question simple answer BREAK "thank goodness we can watch this live @Thami Ngwenya No - I don't . But I put it to you that the reason for that is the greed of ANC cadres who didn't want to share the spoils. They have become massively rich at the expense of the masses. Self esteem is also derived from economic emancipation @Buyiswa Mnyani he will attend family gathering remember he ate the money with them unless he didnt @Nathaniel Perumal no amount of coaching can help you against mountains of evidence! 
1:35:51,1:37:28, he runs a business no wonder we are in the mess we are in this country @Thulani you would not dare try that negotiation you are smarter than that @I Am Free morning mkhaya Agree Derek but still not enough especially private sector "@Nkululeko Zondo  Whew Mahlangu what an opportunity to run away if i was him He finally got his break this guy hey. @eric lakaüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

"If i was him i would stage some sickness hello "He can easily say I was ignorant "The legal team asks questions they already know the answers to.

The mode of operation is that you screw whoever you can to maximise your profits. @Derek Main being converted to what and did it happen after you made enough out of capitalsm @Thami Ngwenya What have you done? I fight exploitation "Be liberated  @Danie Nilsen I am definitely not wealthy. I have a conscience that won't allow me to thrive in a capitalist system. 
1:45:11,1:47:35, is this attempted money laundering? should carry harsh criminal sanction @Danie Nilsen The capitalist system rewards sociopaths. "Derek Mpumalanga should host itz own commission of inquiry. @Danie Nilsen Exactly. @Derek Main claims to be no fan of the very capitalist system that made him to be who he is today. He can even afford dta or internet to be here due to capitalism gains. I am too thirsty. @Derek Main you might not be wealthy but you are not poor and that being not poor comes from capitalst hiw can you ear anything as a person without capitalism @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU And how do you know that I wouldn't be even better off under a more humane and caring system. This guy ufuna ndisele 
1:47:38,1:50:56, @Danie Nilsen Can we say @Derek Main is more like Minister Blade Nzimnande who claimed to be agaisnt the capitalist system that enabled him to drive the latest AMG?

I would spill the beans hello true the problem with socialism is like communism it always fails "or......... your abhorrence towards the capitalist system stems might be the fact that it is somewhat "i AM NOT POOR but dont exploit people learn to share "@Danie Nilsen BS - usually the people who work hardest in a company get paid the least while the execs do their ""work"" on the golf course." 
1:54:21,1:56:08, @Derek Main not if you are the owner not so it's funny how the politicians are servants but live like kings I think there should be a maximum wage. The CEO should be allowed to earn more than say 50 times what the lowest paid worker earns. *shouldn't I am no promoting any system but exploitation no ill be back "That way "@Danie Nilsen What i don't like about capitalism is commercialisation of everything. But "If we can get read of exploitation 
1:56:10,1:59:49, @I Am Free Capitalism has become sheer exploitation. @Derek Main But your points are somewhat valid. I get you. here we go again i.e. sheer exploitation of the subaltern. @Derek Main if i work for a compant out of free will and are satified wit my pay why is capilism bad for a person it is a lot better thabn sitting at astreet courner There have been three systems tried in the last 150 years - Communism Fascism and Capitalism. The first two have been tried and were proved to be unsustainable. Unfortunately in SA most don't know.

Mostly failed. @Derek Main So what system do you support?...Looks like the Che Guevara system?

Road shores or road shows? Agree @LYD online tv @Sindiswa Moolman be careful with who you associate your career & brand with in terms of remote mentorship The Mama's are smarter and stronger than the men. So greedy 
5:39:38,5:41:24, @NEo when the land is in the other peoples hand it will be an 2nd Zimbabwe bankrupt @human we want our land Sugeza wena @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU this guy seems not to be comfortable..perhaps he is fearing for his life.. The ANC wants to build a Mega City on your land. Yaaa . Enkosi for that @LYD online tv "@Sindiswa Moolman Yhuu @Felix Muyoba I agree he looks scared. HE SHOULD HAVE SETTLED IN BY NOW SINCE HE IS NOT A CONFRONTATIONAL WITNESS "I do not think that the past board members are listening to this evidence. If so 
5:42:17,5:44:19, @Phillip Cwazibe I'm sure they were tipped that Dr is gonna take a stand. lol @Lex Luger no am talking about what he is talking about..names like dudu myeni and other big shots..he seems to be uncomfortable on those..

Awesome keep it @Sindiswa Moolman @Sindiswa Moolman Keep it UP I mean... Thanks you @LYD online tv. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so disappointed at Ms Kwinana. She‚Äôs tainting our profession on top of what KPMG did. "@Sindiswa Moolman the reality is that in Accountancy @Sindiswa Moolman A PhD in accounting is as rare as finding a brain surgeon residing in a township. 
5:50:18,5:52:56, "@Lex Luger lol... As much as the analogy hurts Rats... The apahrtheid government handed them the most powerful nation in Africa... And they are conviscating property. And turned it into the BANANA REPUBLIC. lex you sound like a grade 4 white boy @ gav awe to that "Dont worry Hahaha... @Lex Luger. Only recently this profession became involved in these shenanigans @LYD online tv. @LYD online tv People must not come here and just rubbish us off with unfounded information. I know most universities do not have a PhD accounting in their academic staff Becuase the banana republic only hires incompetent people based on the color of their skin @Lex Luger Just think out of a tiny box! Townships were made to be far from urban centres. A surgeon would rather opt for a house in town that living in a township. 
5:53:27,5:54:57, AWEEE gav "Aweee. Thats all you know... BAna repubnlic @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU You don't get my euphemism. Relax and dont struggle with shadows and paper tigers congrats ANC "keith All you can do @Lex Luger is to Google my name and go to my FB where I posted my graduation ceremony. Enough about me . "@Lex Luger Oh ...being euphemistic  PhD in accounting is very rare. Part of the problem is that there is nothing worthy researching at the level of PhD in accounting to count as new knowledge Gav I am from Cpt so awe is well known to describe the situation 
5:55:01,5:57:55, Graduation ceremony? Or BEE toilet paper? Is the IFP really supporting Mayor Gumede. Yeah one liners... AWEEEEE thick banana republic speech IFP joins chorus calling for eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede to resign (BusinessLive 20 May 2019) I have seen money more than R500 000 #Dudu Myeni @StiNK News I am like that tooüòéüòé Shame gav small brain @Sindiswa Moolman I am now absolutely interested. I found a bit of grad photos. Kindly share your topic with me. Would love to read your thesis Thanks @Pastor JJ 
5:58:21,6:00:42, @Sindiswa Moolman I would even want to hold you as an example to my colleagues in accounting who refuse to do PhDs. Mr Ramaphosa should replace corrupt mps with theses honourable people who testify truth and honesty. Honourable Zimbabwean Can u pls stop this nonsense of zulu staff u are talking about.pls with respect @Pastor JJ Thanks mufundisi. Did you find her PhD thesis? Thumbs up Dr Masimba Dahwa Wonder whether there will be requests to cross examine this witness. üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ @Lex Luger Where you live? In the cave or on the rural outskirts of Beaufort West or on some unknown klein dorpitjie ? What makes you so perturbed re: a graduate of @Sindiswa Moolman 's nature! 
6:00:55,6:02:51, @Pastor JJ I agree we can't compare him mahlangu @Lex Luger thank you for opening my eyes. I am a SCM professional so I could easily buy it. Hahahahaha...!! Eff wat has to do with this? @Neo.I do not have a particular view of A President or party in Power..As long as they help the people out of the mirey clay..Which you seem to form part of as I read your comments @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU A PhD in accounting is even more rare than a heart surgeon. Thats why. I am an academic that is why I know these things @Sindiswa Moolman Please dont be offended but I really need your thesis title. @Lex Luger Totally do not concur. I know the rationale why this perturbed. I know it! @lexi 
6:03:11,6:05:56, "Dr Dahwa Eish Zimbabwe running SAA @ Neo..Yes Im a settler just as you are...we all are..I stood up and walked ..You choose to stay in the mud..I wish I could help you to stand up and walk.. @Dorothy Milne Indeed. He is credit to the taxpayers. @Lex Luger Your rationale behind your perturbance is resounding to me. "For your own information there is a guy who did a PhD. Was an accountant/still is @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU You have no facts sir Dr Dahwa is a right person to run SAA nothing wrong there #Neville Watson Surely there is so much you can do with double entry and that is all covered at B. Comm. Hons is just specialisation.

You have noticed guys it‚Äôs easy and quick to follow dr Dahwa‚Äôs testimony which opened gaps where and how the problem started which stripped SAA funds executives interfering on procurement without malusi zulu speaking man.do u mean about his dark skin "@Sindiswa Moolman Quite impressive.btw 
6:09:03,6:13:03, @lex can't accept the fact that a black woman is more educated than you I would go into partnership with this honourable doctor anytime after all he is from my birth country. "Government procedures must be tight so that no one will just do as he or she pleases as they want to push without following due process and regulations @Sindiswa Moolman is this your title? Chief Director: Financial Processing & Reporting Dept of Justice + Constitutional Development? Those people think not signing anything is a way out Guptor school Yes @LYD online tv Yip that's why all the letters were unsigned @Millicent Shozi I would never ever wear my education on my sleeve. And you have no idea how many black young women I have supervised to completion at PhD. And by the way I am black

Biden for prez National Treasury and DTI also corrupt @Vincent Nthomang you should hear me incorrectly pronounce isiXhosa words. Nothing to be ashamed of though... Trump victory 2020 @Lex Luger Indeed... #FourMoreYears 
6:28:16,6:29:40, this man suffered @KQ Proud American Woman Of Trump? We need a Trump like President here in SA..No nonsence no fear approach @Millicent Shozi I feel for him. DUDU MYENI WANTS TO CROSS-EXAMINE STATE CAPTURE WITNESSES (EWN) Trump has thousands of patriots in this country. Heh! Zondo likes his lunch adjournments. Thank you @BornFree üôèüèºüíê @Dominic Przybylski üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄthe lunch question also surprised me 
6:29:41,6:31:24, let her she will go down the drain Procurement expert being instructed by a primary school teacher. Abhorrent.. Zondo for Chef... @Toni Oliveira You mean a s**thole? This communist government patronises communists. dudu will have to give evidence her side of the story before cross examing. @Toni Oliveira Bistro Chef @Derek..Respect the man. SACP is in control of ANC yet they have never stood in an election. 
6:32:00,6:36:47, How is the SACP in control of the ANC @Dominic Przybylski ? True.. Apparently SACP has been the brains behind the ANC. How is that control? How many SACP members are in Cabinet? What percentage do they constitute? Ay two hours later and this neo guy is still creating division. Leave this man. He is a clown "SACP defined strategy for ANC according to what I have read The apartheid government used control by communists argument to gain sympathy from Western powers during the cold war. @Mzalwane Mzala she thinks it's walk in the park... Thinking of her old privilege when she was protected by JZ USSR didn't support ANC from a philanthropic point of view. Once in power they were expected to repay the soviets. That's why JZ was so desperate to give Putin the nuclear deal. 
6:36:51,6:38:25, "@Toni Oliveira...no nonsense no fear approach to leadership When did the SACP define strategy for the ANC? @Brian Leaver why are they even entertaining the Neo person? May I ask what Tribe is this man from? If anyone knows. Thank you Has been their role throughout as far as I understand. @KQ Proud American Woman what do you mean? He's Shona @KQ He is Shona This Neo person needs help..He is very angry..Can someone please help him.. Thank you üôèüèº 
6:38:31,6:40:04, What is the basis for the alliance if SACP has not provided any voters? KQ we have nations in Africa "@KQ Proud American Woman He sounds very Shona. But we don't say tribe The apartheid government had to push a narrative that said black people had no problem with apartheid but the 'struggle' was part of communists' plan to expand their sphere of control. This Witness is in a different league to the previous Dude who knew nothing. The Doctor doesn't even need his notes. @Toni Oliveira the neo person is seeking attention. "@Millicent Shozi yes No disrespect at all. Just asking with innocent curiosity @Mzalwane Mzala I'm interested. What benefit does SACP provide to ANC and if there is no benefit what is the point of the alliance? 
6:40:12,6:41:48, @brian muleya.Absolutely.. @KQ Proud American Woman As long as you avoid the word tribe. It carries negative connotations sponsored by colonialists and reactionary anthropologists. Brown he is brilliant give me the shonas anytime i had 30 on my staff @KQ Proud American Woman where are you from? very stimulating @LexLugar Sad I see it as an honor to the people. @LYD America @Mzalwane Mzala Pleas give a brief summary of what the basis for the alliance is? 
6:41:54,6:44:01, @lyd online...Give him some attention we need to guide the person..Hes killing himself with anger.. @Dominic Przybylski Please don't forget that the ANC was not formed as a party for contesting elections. They have been in elections for the last 25 years. @Dominic Przybylski Give an email address and we listen to the witness. "@KQ Proud American Woman where in America? Canada @Dominic Przybylski The ANC has opted to remain a liberation movement Sorry @Mzalwane Mzala I don't give my email address to strangers. @Toni Oliveira...Who is this one who is killing himself with anger... @Toni Oliveira okay... lol 
6:44:14,6:45:37, @LexLugar Such a shame. I have so many ethicity in me. So I clame all from all my ancestors you That's ok. Find documents to read on the issue. claim* @KQ Proud American Woman Interesting that when you talk of yourself you use ethnicity and when you talk of the witness you use tribe. Just don't do that @Mzalwane Mzala That is just rhetoric as far as I can work out. How can they genuinely be a liberation movement if they have been the government for a quarter of a century? @brian muleya..I was refering to this very angry neo person he can give answers to every question asked @Lex Luger she's full of it... "@KQ Proud American Woman I challenge you to say ""I have many tribes in me""" 
6:45:40,6:47:33, "As an American I am Spanish @LYD online tv üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ @Michael Michael did you watch the previous witness - Mahalangu? hahahaha..!! I honor them all @Dominic Przybylski You will never understand the ANC if you view them solely through the prism of electoral politics. @KQ Proud American Woman Just say I made of many different tribes "@LexLugar Thank you lyden I did.i wish him well in orange overalls.he is disgrace to his family and friends @Dominic Przybylski You have not yet provided evidence of the control of cabinet by the SACP.

The doctor puts them all to shame "@dan brown. I fear for this witness If we had this level of intelligence in our SOEs nothing can stand in RSA's way. Get rid of the dead wood.

"No wonder we have so much problems on our SOE "Trump is a ticking timebomb ...Political Constipation The socialist Democrats. .American politics is controlled by global elites. Clinton was expected but went on to serve his second term.. what is that all about? Trump is and will be the best President of the USA. He is not racist but he will call out those nationalities that are terrorists. Fake news about Trump is now entering the chat room that has to do with state capture in the RSA. The ANC has not helped black people in this country. Trump has created many jobs for the Blacks and Latinos and building housing for them. @Yin yang how did you see racism in ANC? 
7:49:55,7:57:23, He is telling the truth this witness "...Opinions presented as the facts is entertaining Rubbish what Rubbish.. have you watched his recent campaigns?? he was voted by the voters and he will win in 2020. .
