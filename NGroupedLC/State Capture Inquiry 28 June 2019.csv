"So many people loose their lives My question is when are these criminals going to be arrested? """ can I qualify"" haha" Makes me wonder what he did in all his other contracts he was boasting about. A SARS Team watching these proceedings very carefully. They are determining who could be implicated in tax evasion.

He's being defiant! @Thami Ngwenya Apartheid destroyed self-esteem. Salute Chair How could you motivate? hehehehe now is asking protection from chair

Miss Hofmeyer is on another level. Thou shall not steal this doesn't know what he is dowing there he is only wasting time

Its fruitless expenditure "Even if he was coming to tell lies?? I am pulling my hair watching

This guy will have heart attack soon. i could have came to the commission if i were him. i would rather have handed myself to the migistrate dating Hofmeyer must be real tough 
1:34:21,1:35:02, he want to frustrate anybody Knowing Mr Mahlangu he is not stupid but because of the exposed corruption he did he is acting in a funny way simply bcoz he has no place to hide and no answers can save him h h h h hence @Thami Ngwenya I just know from my own experience that I did not succeed until I learned to believe in myself (self-esteem). "Here i quote the great Magashule "" He is innocent until proven guilty""'" if it's standard why did it not form part of the terms and conditions imagine trying to negotiate with her for ukuya emajiteni perhaps the best this to do was to come clean and speak the truth to the commission he disappointed his entire family. I'm sure he will never attend family gatherings from here on. Yoooo iMALI route of all EVIL 
1:35:13,1:35:50, @Biza330 this is what you get for being Zuma's friend. "this guy had a night to talk to his lawyer simple question simple answer BREAK "thank goodness we can watch this live @Thami Ngwenya No - I don't . But I put it to you that the reason for that is the greed of ANC cadres who didn't want to share the spoils. They have become massively rich at the expense of the masses. Self esteem is also derived from economic emancipation @Buyiswa Mnyani he will attend family gathering remember he ate the money with them unless he didnt @Nathaniel Perumal no amount of coaching can help you against mountains of evidence! 
1:35:51,1:37:28, he runs a business no wonder we are in the mess we are in this country @Thulani you would not dare try that negotiation you are smarter than that @I Am Free morning mkhaya Agree Derek but still not enough especially private sector "@Nkululeko Zondo  Whew Mahlangu what an opportunity to run away if i was him He finally got his break this guy hey. @eric laka😂😂😂😂😂 
1:37:29,1:39:04, @Thami Ngwenya The point is that the current BEE model is not working. It needs to be relooked at. Make sure this guy does not run away during the break! "If i was him i would stage some sickness hello "He can easily say I was ignorant "The legal team asks questions they already know the answers to.

The mode of operation is that you screw whoever you can to maximise your profits. @Derek Main being converted to what and did it happen after you made enough out of capitalsm @Thami Ngwenya What have you done? I fight exploitation "Be liberated  @Danie Nilsen I am definitely not wealthy. I have a conscience that won't allow me to thrive in a capitalist system. 
1:45:11,1:47:35, is this attempted money laundering? should carry harsh criminal sanction @Danie Nilsen The capitalist system rewards sociopaths. "Derek Mpumalanga should host itz own commission of inquiry. @Danie Nilsen Exactly. @Derek Main claims to be no fan of the very capitalist system that made him to be who he is today. He can even afford dta or internet to be here due to capitalism gains. I am too thirsty. @Derek Main you might not be wealthy but you are not poor and that being not poor comes from capitalst hiw can you ear anything as a person without capitalism @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU And how do you know that I wouldn't be even better off under a more humane and caring system.

I would spill the beans hello true the problem with socialism is like communism it always fails "or......... your abhorrence towards the capitalist system stems might be the fact that it is somewhat "i AM NOT POOR but dont exploit people learn to share "@Danie Nilsen BS - usually the people who work hardest in a company get paid the least while the execs do their ""work"" on the golf course." 
1:54:21,1:56:08, @Derek Main not if you are the owner not so it's funny how the politicians are servants but live like kings I think there should be a maximum wage. The CEO should be allowed to earn more than say 50 times what the lowest paid worker earns. *shouldn't I am no promoting any system but exploitation no ill be back "That way "@Danie Nilsen What i don't like about capitalism is commercialisation of everything. But "If we can get read of exploitation 
1:56:10,1:59:49, @I Am Free Capitalism has become sheer exploitation. @Derek Main But your points are somewhat valid. I get you. here we go again i.e. sheer exploitation of the subaltern. @Derek Main if i work for a compant out of free will and are satified wit my pay why is capilism bad for a person it is a lot better thabn sitting at astreet courner There have been three systems tried in the last 150 years - Communism Fascism and Capitalism. The first two have been tried and were proved to be unsustainable. Unfortunately in SA most don't know. "The winner takes all @Dominic Przybylski Look at countries that adopted or opted for the system opposite to capitalism. Mostly failed. @Derek Main So what system do you support?...Looks like the Che Guevara system? 
2:00:22,2:02:16, @StINK News Wish i can smoke but i can't with this surprise flu here In 4th Industrial Revolution the understanding is that the most important factor of production will no longer be land.

I don't think he can afford to actually appear.

AWEEEEE thick banana republic speech IFP joins chorus calling for eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede to resign (BusinessLive 20 May 2019) I have seen money more than R500 000 #Dudu Myeni @StiNK News I am like that too😎😎 Shame gav small brain @Sindiswa Moolman I am now absolutely interested. I found a bit of grad photos. Kindly share your topic with me. Would love to read your thesis Thanks @Pastor JJ 
5:58:21,6:00:42, @Sindiswa Moolman I would even want to hold you as an example to my colleagues in accounting who refuse to do PhDs. Mr Ramaphosa should replace corrupt mps with theses honourable people who testify truth and honesty. Honourable Zimbabwean Can u pls stop this nonsense of zulu staff u are talking about.pls with respect @Pastor JJ Thanks mufundisi. Did you find her PhD thesis? Thumbs up Dr Masimba Dahwa Wonder whether there will be requests to cross examine this witness. 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 @Lex Luger Where you live? In the cave or on the rural outskirts of Beaufort West or on some unknown klein dorpitjie ? What makes you so perturbed re: a graduate of @Sindiswa Moolman 's nature! 
6:00:55,6:02:51, @Pastor JJ I agree we can't compare him mahlangu @Lex Luger thank you for opening my eyes. I am a SCM professional so I could easily buy it. Hahahahaha...!! Eff wat has to do with this? @Neo.I do not have a particular view of A President or party in Power..As long as they help the people out of the mirey clay..Which you seem to form part of as I read your comments @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU A PhD in accounting is even more rare than a heart surgeon. Thats why. I am an academic that is why I know these things @Sindiswa Moolman Please dont be offended but I really need your thesis title. @Lex Luger Totally do not concur. I know the rationale why this perturbed. I know it! @lexi 
6:03:11,6:05:56, "Dr Dahwa Eish Zimbabwe running SAA @ Neo..Yes Im a settler just as you are...we all are..I stood up and walked ..You choose to stay in the mud..I wish I could help you to stand up and walk.. @Dorothy Milne Indeed. He is credit to the taxpayers. @Lex Luger Your rationale behind your perturbance is resounding to me. "For your own information there is a guy who did a PhD. Was an accountant/still is @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU You have no facts sir Dr Dahwa is a right person to run SAA nothing wrong there #Neville Watson Surely there is so much you can do with double entry and that is all covered at B. Comm. Hons is just specialisation. 
6:05:59,6:08:44, @makhosi nobhatyi nothing indeed wrong there. I'd hire him too if it were my co. The Dr is honest .Zim 1 Bafana 0 "@Sindiswa Moolman I will look for your thesis I’m impressed @LYD online tv "indeed Makhosi @You see..Ive managed to engage you..Not like youve been saying and advising to block the colonisers..I sincerely would love to help you especially in your anger.Which comes from within YOURSELF. You have noticed guys it’s easy and quick to follow dr Dahwa’s testimony which opened gaps where and how the problem started which stripped SAA funds executives interfering on procurement without malusi zulu speaking man.do u mean about his dark skin "@Sindiswa Moolman Quite impressive.btw 
6:09:03,6:13:03, @lex can't accept the fact that a black woman is more educated than you I would go into partnership with this honourable doctor anytime after all he is from my birth country. "Government procedures must be tight so that no one will just do as he or she pleases as they want to push without following due process and regulations @Sindiswa Moolman is this your title? Chief Director: Financial Processing & Reporting Dept of Justice + Constitutional Development? Those people think not signing anything is a way out Guptor school Yes @LYD online tv Yip that's why all the letters were unsigned @Millicent Shozi I would never ever wear my education on my sleeve. And you have no idea how many black young women I have supervised to completion at PhD. And by the way I am black

Paper trails will lead investigators there @Lex Luger Keep it up @LYD online tv And you? What do you do? @Lex Luger I'm a Supply Chain Manager 
6:25:34,6:27:51, Hello 👋 everyone @LYD online tv Keep it up. As long as we earn without thieving. I am proud of all who earn without thieving KQ 👋 @KQ Proud American Woman Hallo lady. Biden for prez National Treasury and DTI also corrupt @Vincent Nthomang you should hear me incorrectly pronounce isiXhosa words. Nothing to be ashamed of though... Trump victory 2020 @Lex Luger Indeed... #FourMoreYears 
6:28:16,6:29:40, this man suffered @KQ Proud American Woman Of Trump? We need a Trump like President here in SA..No nonsence no fear approach @Millicent Shozi I feel for him. DUDU MYENI WANTS TO CROSS-EXAMINE STATE CAPTURE WITNESSES (EWN) Trump has thousands of patriots in this country. Heh! Zondo likes his lunch adjournments. Thank you @BornFree 🙏🏼💐 @Dominic Przybylski 😀😀😀😀😀😀the lunch question also surprised me 
6:29:41,6:31:24, let her she will go down the drain Procurement expert being instructed by a primary school teacher. Abhorrent.. Zondo for Chef... @Toni Oliveira You mean a s**thole? This communist government patronises communists. dudu will have to give evidence her side of the story before cross examing. @Toni Oliveira Bistro Chef @Derek..Respect the man. SACP is in control of ANC yet they have never stood in an election. 
6:32:00,6:36:47, How is the SACP in control of the ANC @Dominic Przybylski ? True.. Apparently SACP has been the brains behind the ANC. How is that control? How many SACP members are in Cabinet? What percentage do they constitute? Ay two hours later and this neo guy is still creating division. Leave this man. He is a clown "SACP defined strategy for ANC according to what I have read The apartheid government used control by communists argument to gain sympathy from Western powers during the cold war. @Mzalwane Mzala she thinks it's walk in the park... Thinking of her old privilege when she was protected by JZ USSR didn't support ANC from a philanthropic point of view. Once in power they were expected to repay the soviets. That's why JZ was so desperate to give Putin the nuclear deal. 
6:36:51,6:38:25, "@Toni Oliveira...no nonsense no fear approach to leadership When did the SACP define strategy for the ANC? @Brian Leaver why are they even entertaining the Neo person? May I ask what Tribe is this man from? If anyone knows. Thank you Has been their role throughout as far as I understand. @KQ Proud American Woman what do you mean? He's Shona @KQ He is Shona This Neo person needs help..He is very angry..Can someone please help him.. Thank you 🙏🏼 
6:38:31,6:40:04, What is the basis for the alliance if SACP has not provided any voters? KQ we have nations in Africa "@KQ Proud American Woman He sounds very Shona. But we don't say tribe The apartheid government had to push a narrative that said black people had no problem with apartheid but the 'struggle' was part of communists' plan to expand their sphere of control. This Witness is in a different league to the previous Dude who knew nothing. The Doctor doesn't even need his notes. @Toni Oliveira the neo person is seeking attention. "@Millicent Shozi yes No disrespect at all. Just asking with innocent curiosity @Mzalwane Mzala I'm interested. What benefit does SACP provide to ANC and if there is no benefit what is the point of the alliance? 
6:40:12,6:41:48, @brian muleya.Absolutely.. @KQ Proud American Woman As long as you avoid the word tribe. It carries negative connotations sponsored by colonialists and reactionary anthropologists. Brown he is brilliant give me the shonas anytime i had 30 on my staff @KQ Proud American Woman where are you from? very stimulating @LexLugar Sad I see it as an honor to the people. @LYD America @Mzalwane Mzala Pleas give a brief summary of what the basis for the alliance is? 
6:41:54,6:44:01, @lyd online...Give him some attention we need to guide the person..Hes killing himself with anger.. @Dominic Przybylski Please don't forget that the ANC was not formed as a party for contesting elections. They have been in elections for the last 25 years. @Dominic Przybylski Give an email address and we listen to the witness. "@KQ Proud American Woman where in America? Canada @Dominic Przybylski The ANC has opted to remain a liberation movement Sorry @Mzalwane Mzala I don't give my email address to strangers. @Toni Oliveira...Who is this one who is killing himself with anger... @Toni Oliveira okay... lol 
6:44:14,6:45:37, @LexLugar Such a shame. I have so many ethicity in me. So I clame all from all my ancestors you That's ok. Find documents to read on the issue. claim* @KQ Proud American Woman Interesting that when you talk of yourself you use ethnicity and when you talk of the witness you use tribe. Just don't do that @Mzalwane Mzala That is just rhetoric as far as I can work out. How can they genuinely be a liberation movement if they have been the government for a quarter of a century? @brian muleya..I was refering to this very angry neo person he can give answers to every question asked @Lex Luger she's full of it... "@KQ Proud American Woman I challenge you to say ""I have many tribes in me""" 
6:45:40,6:47:33, "As an American I am Spanish @LYD online tv 😀😀😀😀😀 @Michael Michael did you watch the previous witness - Mahalangu? hahahaha..!! I honor them all @Dominic Przybylski You will never understand the ANC if you view them solely through the prism of electoral politics. @KQ Proud American Woman Just say I made of many different tribes "@LexLugar Thank you lyden I did.i wish him well in orange overalls.he is disgrace to his family and friends @Dominic Przybylski You have not yet provided evidence of the control of cabinet by the SACP. 
6:47:42,6:49:24, @Mzalwane Mzala I probably never will if I accept that we are a democracy and they are the party which was voted into power. "@KQ proud american woman..🤔🤔🤔The general word for your 3xplanation is ""SETTLER""" @KQ Proud American Woman Be proud of whatever you call yourself and be ashamed for calling other human beings tribes. Sies!! All that and My daughter is all that and Irish and German @KQ Proud American Woman So what tribe is your daughter? @LexLugar YOU BETTER STEP BACK OF DEMANDING ME OF DOING ANYTHING @LexLugar She’s My Tribe @KQ Proud American Woman What TRIBE are YOU? 'Murica

6:50:43,6:52:11, Dr myb she drunk "@KQ ..We all under the group. "" SETTLERS""" @Millicent Shozi I am not joking there are no tribes here. And when we point it out people must accept it. Not be arrogant about their silliness I think someone Has issues and jealousy is a very evil sin @KQ Proud American Woman There are no tribes here. lex im blocking you bye BYE 👋 LEX LOOGER "@Millicent Shozi Hamba Lex we are africans

It’s a huge continent I think there is plenty of room for you all Lex is too late we cant change it now and we have no regret for that @KQ Proud American Woman African population is exploding and fight over land is cause of almost all the conflict in the continent. Lex fully agree So Lex what’s your neighbor 3000 miles away up to? This tribal nonsense was implanted by colonial administrators and it has caused a lot of damage. We are children of this soil.

7:28:33,7:32:27, Dr Dahwa is so much the opposite of the person before him. I feel for him. You can see honesty and integrity in every pore of his being. The doctor is intelligent and an honourable man in like the ANC cheif whips and officers ...Very dignified JZ has Robin Hood aspirations. Fairytales running the country. The doctor puts them all to shame "@dan brown. I fear for this witness If we had this level of intelligence in our SOEs nothing can stand in RSA's way. Get rid of the dead wood. "He seems like a caring man Go to the beginning of his testimony he speaks about his doctrine and his studies and experience 
7:32:41,7:37:16, ...Zuma's Presidency is/ was worse than he Dutch Boers occupation @BornFree I will thank you 😊 thank goodness to all those who attempted to expose this Dudu Myeni...! "Mr Aubrey Thanks to the brave and courageous exposing all this corruption and racketeering. "Zuma ..Avaricious mara Dudu yena 
7:37:18,7:41:55, Keep Trump out of this.. they are not one and the same. Don't insult my President or compare him to to any President here or in Africa. Very true @Kevin Allister Simon th ANC loathes competence and intellect "Born free ​ Trump's Advisors are President  Rubbish Trump is his own man. Male You should be referring to that Kenyan.. Obama Obama was the worst President ever @to all chatters..Thanx for the space guys..Wish you all well. Bye.. 
7:42:03,7:49:42, Obama was so bad the Americans made him serve two terms! "No wonder we have so much problems on our SOE "Trump is a ticking timebomb ...Political Constipation The socialist Democrats. .American politics is controlled by global elites. Clinton was expected but went on to serve his second term.. what is that all about? Trump is and will be the best President of the USA. He is not racist but he will call out those nationalities that are terrorists. Fake news about Trump is now entering the chat room that has to do with state capture in the RSA. The ANC has not helped black people in this country. Trump has created many jobs for the Blacks and Latinos and building housing for them. @Yin yang how did you see racism in ANC? 
7:49:55,7:57:23, He is telling the truth this witness "...Opinions presented as the facts is entertaining Rubbish what Rubbish.. have you watched his recent campaigns?? he was voted by the voters and he will win in 2020. . "@Yin Yang Des van Rooyen. Undisputed champ! Weekend Special "Trump is a racist! and where did ""Trump is building houses"" come from???? also Trump received about 2 million LESS votes than Secretary Clinton." "@Yin Yang so you expect them to be in positions when they are not supporting ANC? And again 
7:57:34,8:07:43, "...If the Governments in Africa could retrieve the stolen monies and minerals born free. you take the bait very easily. just to reel you in now. "@Yin Yang Dudu...yooo yooo. It's coming. There is Section 204 of The Criminal Procedures Act. investigate it this weekend. 😁 Yin Yang. It's like we were at war. is this live or im i dreaming Live @fuzile dazana LIVE thnks 
8:07:45,8:11:46, @fuzile dazana exactly what I'm wondering considering the time is this overtime @joe khoza@ying yang guys are we not all on the same side guys as the human race why do we have to mudsling They are working hard these days. @fuzile dazana 😁🤣 Yin. I was referring to an article that said out economic contract was only beaten by countries at war. Eish! We are a disgrace to the whole world. @rohan barnard commission of Inquiries usually go into the night.. The Eskom one used to end at 3am at times yet start at 8am. Dudu again......drowning 
8:13:06,8:19:36, I'm proud of this commission. I think it demonstrates the thoughtfulness of out previous PP. "@Kevin Allister Simon - I agree with you 1 Just be patient. The hammer will drop. we dont want thesis we want truth Des. Also read section 204.......weekend special project.😂 I have confidence this will result in catharsis. I'm only waiting for Msholozi's testimony to hear how he is innocent in all of this 😁 If that happens. R100 =$1.00 US.

8:24:09,8:27:30, @Mzalwane Mzala Indeed Ms Nahntsi must come clear. That's true @Phillip @mzala I just don't understand why this girl nantsi will let these people mess up her life and she's just a willing participant...she might be .CA but her business acumen shame leaves a lot to be When she was here she portrayed herself as someone who was always scared of Dudu Myeni. mis nantsi is talking this this guy is talking this who is foolling who "This witness is so credible  @fuzile dazana Miss Nantsi admitted that she never worked with this guy @Fuzile Dazana I believe the gentleman. @mzala hence you cannot be a puppet by dudu who has a teachers qualification when you are a CA...seriously ? nantsi was duped she's not clever enough being a CA does not mean life experience 
8:27:41,8:29:54, Kirk. Pray explain your view on witness. @Yin Yang I understand I can only afford a wheelbarrow with it.... you dont believe mis nantshi Sorry Kirk. I understand. sell them brother this guy he speaks like agrizzy It is shocking that she could be a witness against a person that she did not know. @Thembisa Odendaal she must account. can see the sabc is bankrupt with the test signal its falling a part
