13:22,21:05, Refiloe Molefe is her name I remember this guy from my Glen Thomas days.. her name is Adv Refiloe Molefe Thanx Robert I said it a long time ago that Agrizzi only told gossip on Jiba and Mrwebi. hence TheMzolo says Advocate "I nvr trusted the Agrizzi guy kabelo you correct people who just do what they wish to do must answer for their doings Majavu is a heavy weight of the legal fraternity 
22:58,28:07, "Saba this Agrizzi guy nvr said anything in regard 2 his involvement as office bearer of Bosasa @Saba SIizwe...What do you mean by advocate? Ms Jiba has been referred to as Snake based on Agrizzi's hearsay testimony. should the chair dismiss ?? "I suspected that something myt be wrong the day he publicly agreed that he is racist Agrizi must come forward Majavu knows his story what is the argument here guys is this lawyer wants to cross examine agrizzy? Jiba will go down she never prostitute 
28:48,32:37, the day has come for state capture This guy knows his story "Majavu seems like a top attorney Mr Majavu has convinced the chair to cross examine Agrizzi 1k people czwe this man is the future why is aggrrizzi running away now?????? "@Barry Silla today witness guys? 
32:55,35:36, This guy sounds sharp. THIS GUY IS NOT SCARED OF ZONDO Abe it's Majavu "@Abe Molefe Witness today is former Phumelela Municipal Manager Adv. Zola Majavu is a star/ morning Zando is fair Anne M thank you "Adv Majavu is not a witness @ Anne True 
36:18,38:00, when is the new state capture.... the CR17 can't wait well trained Mr Majavu He's so calm and collected with no emotions like Muzi Skhakane who wanted to like cry every now and then. @thandeka precious The current PP is investigating CR17 round of applause for Mr Majavu 👏👏👏👏 "Who is this she "I have been following his process since he ws appointed psl prosecutor There will be no more state capture after this one I promise Indeed Witsie..🙏🏾… 
38:06,39:20, is he a snake??? @Esther Katjiuongua-Kamberipa Adv Majavu represents Adv Jiba who was named by Agrizzi as having received bribes is the sound fine? Singi yep lol code name S.N.A.K.E the sound is not centered izinyoka from my side its sharp Jiba must face the law how can not see Guptas steals money 
39:27,42:23, the sound is not okay @ Ann M. Thank you 🙏 fix the sound pleaseee Majavu has since been Jiba's savior and he continues to do so @Esther Katjiuongua-Kamberipa 👍 On my side - sound is crisp and clear "whatever they're talking about Majava is a proper Advocate. left them jaw dropped viva Majavu 
42:27,54:10, "I suppose a snake🐍 not in the actual sense "Every council will be defending his or her client "Makhosi Nobhatyi "@ Kabelo Katjedi will be like zim soon cause no 1 payback looted money or sentenced Esther im just worried abt the manner in which Zondo allows this councils trying 2 channel him on what 2 do.Some might feel that their client shouldn't b cross examined even though he must force them2 what is thisssss "once you force them to give evidence u myt come across the answers like i do not recall This inquiry is a mockery will continue till 2030 
57:15,1:04:31, what time are we resuming? any time now Rohan Would like for someone to tell Mr Majav to F...k Off ! He and Jiba disgusting human beings thank you @Smart Guys Everyone has got rights Zondo said 10min break it's now 20 minutes Zondo never keeps time tiyabuya emzansi

SA has its own time zone which not everybody understands 😂😂 "This Commission is a complete waste of time  @jasper dougal You boast about your rights but take insist on Jiba's rights to be ignored. langatsi asihlonishwa ngiceli phone number ya Chairperson. ngifuna kuceli nhloniphk 
1:07:38,1:10:34, No Racists are allowed here @Khulubuse Z - we block all of them LOL@rohan barnard - I feel like this commission is like the BOLD and BEAUTIFUL ... no matter where u pick up from all now what's happening *You will *know "If Jiba had taken as much time to do her job correctly as she spends in Court or Commissions  jasper u have still said nothing and despite wether the high court will consider we deserved to know how people steal our money in the name of radical economic transformation Jiba only went to one commission. Mara Zondo yena Yes and that was one too many ! 
1:10:51,1:13:17, @Sofia Sofia 😂😂😂😂 Bold and the Beautiful aka Zondo and The Corrupt 😂😂😂 "PP and CR court battles LOL @rohan barnard - HAHAHA The Commission of short adjournments and tea breaks "When does it start We all have rights post-apartheid Zondo only has one speed Yesterday the DCJ wanted early Lunch.....now a long tea break...Eish @Khulubuse Z The self-righteousness of some people irritate me. They are racist. 
1:13:17,1:16:50, Imagine talking to thieves all day ... Even I would take long breaks Zondo had to take a break from Agrizzi... what's happening? "@Mzalwane Mzala you are correct "boring part of this is time keeping @rohan barnard IS AGrizzi on today ? "We all need each other "Can people just get over apartheid  does anyone have volume? the video's muted on my end... 
1:16:52,1:19:25, But ok lets give it a chance We can agree that corruption is wrong but we will not be fans of racists. "@Max Muskat I have sound "@Anne M. ahhh She has been on so many times I think its time the nerves went away ... "No Huny@Khulubuse Z I don't believe I mentioned that I don't like Black woman """ HALLO Mzalwane Mzala "I don’t understand why people have a problem that amounts to a different ratio of melanin under the skin  how are you doing mzalwane mzala 
1:20:25,1:27:11, "Hi @Andrew Mboweni  "@goolamv ...look in the mirror and say This is a farce and now they are sticking the middle finger at us Miss Buthelezi is too soft and shyness to ask constructive questions I hope today she will rise up to the game the sound is only coming out of one earphone I have yet to see the evidence leaders with anything near Advocate Wim Trengove’s ability. Looks like the State reluctant to bring any Big Guns to the table @jasper dougal Then you haven't been watching much of this commission. The Chair appoints his legal team. It has nothing to do with the state or ANC. "SABC’S recording especially the sound is generally atrocious 
1:28:14,1:33:22, "Racists are crazy. The chair was appointed by the Chief Justice Advocate Pretorius made a shocking job with Zums WHO IS A FOOL????? EFF Will never fall the tell the truth to power @Khulubuse Z I think u r a very arrogant human ! this blck lady lawyer isn't every1's cup of tea that does not mean cause she is blck! if she ws White /Indian/coloured I personally wouldve said same what is this garbage @Khulubuse Z - did you go to school? .... I bel you cannot spell and therefor you should sit down ... @Sofia Sofia I read it on twitter that he was / still is going to be cross-examined today Esq." 
1:33:22,1:36:07, "Those keep saying this inquiry is nonsense & waste etc sexist @Khulubuse Z anything you say huni ... "the funny thing is that the people who follow anc know about corruption that take place but they still vote for that because they want free champagnes Esq." All these witnesses come here with nothing to tell ! but the truth is that we need transformation in our country we dont have development @Sofia Sofia could be.... But i'm pretty sure they said on twitter that it was today. Maybe I misread lol @African Refugee I don’t understand you; who said some people are sent to jail due to what we are hearing? 
1:36:32,1:38:49, CR 17 SHOULD ADDRESS THE STATE OF CORRUPTION ADDRESS @rohan barnard maybe you dint .. there was supposed to be 2 witnesses today but they will only deal with one @Sofia Sofia this is me running to twitter. I know Jiba wanted to cross examine Agrizzi. @African Refugee - `Totally ! Ill wait for you to give me feedback @rohan barnard cant wait for the parliament to open there will be questions to the president Can this woman speak ... S E R I O U S L Y @Sofia Sofia according to Jacarandafm Nomgcobo Jiba applied to cross-examine Angelo Agrizzi but the truth is that we need transformation in our country we dont have development 
1:39:02,1:40:21, is that aunt jamima @Sofia Sofia #statecaptureinquiry on twitter WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING @rohan barnard Adv Majavu (representing Jiba) appeared before this witness and the cross examination has been postponed until other witnesses have given evidence. I strongly believe this capture will take forever and a day @African Refugee "@Mbuso Ndlovu Are you trying to contaminate the subject on table? So far CR17 was fund by this or that but not yet caught leasing this or that to this or that funder this is what we dealing with Thank you @Anne M. @Anne M. Thanks hun you always seem to know these things 😃 
1:40:31,1:44:20, this is about as interesting as a diarrhea Popsicle @African Refugee this one looks like Willie Wallie Bookworm ! @ Ibo Why Cyril is hiding his funders Something wrong with the sound? YES THEY HAVENT FIXED IT I would like to see who funded NDZ Vary Nice "@African Refugee We never had a firmed officially publicly said version I think the main qualifying criteria to be employed in Government is : you have to be corrupt: Must have a track record of corruption! Must be fluent in corruption ! 
1:44:37,1:50:24, @African Refugee and in the end a conclusion will be hand over by Zondo to the Gov and then the law would be expect to step in.2/2 immigrants can stay "Anyone notice how whistle blowers want to ""seem "" so innocent ...." @African Refugee - You say it like it is ..... 🙌 - agree with you 100000% "@African Refugee Why you are so negative @African Refugee but what you say is true ... How many people have come on here ... were are they today ... ? hands are still in the cookie jar hi We are all still suffering .... when will we ever see the fruits of this ... its not being negative its the truth @African Refugee Amen ! u said it 
1:50:26,1:58:53, I will not use the word hijack but Mr. Radebe was correct. 😂😂 why can everyone see this ... this inquiry is a lie @African Refugee Why is whitewash? Why is not you and your ilk trying to disrupt the inquiry for a hideous agenda? 😂 kumnandekhaya @African Refugee Do you KNOW the mean the academically mean state capture? Do you know where in the world this name was used before? "I wonder what criteria the Commission used to establish if their evidence leaders are sufficiently experienced to do the job  "@African Refugee Please google ""state capture around the world"" and then come back to the debate" Zuma is king of the Zulus 
1:59:26,2:05:44, SA is not the 1st or 2nd in the world we are all kings and queens Zuma is the king of the stooges musa don't generalized abt Zulu's So where are we here?? While Mcebisi is busy dodging Duduzane and publishing books!! @African Refugee Stop saying it’s this or that party start or concocted this name or notion & then that follow it. It’s nonsense what you are saying and you seems only aim to disrupt the inquiry "I wonder when Mr Zums is going to grace the Commission with a reappearance the commission is here to prove whether there was state capture or not in south africa under zuma administration. lets listen and learn. I fail to understand why the Hawks or NPA have not even opened any dockets yet on people who have been found ‘wanting so-to- speak’ what are they waiting for? 
2:07:28,2:12:03, @African Refugee Zuma said the inquiry was set up for “only the purpose to bring him to the inquiry” and since then 100% Z boys placard holder keep dancing on the same pathetic stupidity This is all smoke and mirrors @African refugees please don’t spread your own opinion CR17 received money from people whom was concerned and wanted the best for the country which they believe with the candidates msg was clear guys is your sound okay? "@jasper dougal Shaun the sheep @shawn mabilu Yes to me BOSSA donation was part of CR17 campaign ? Why ? to see the country successful ? REALLY ? Is that what im supposed to believe ? "Our country has deteriorated to the lowest levels. Leaders are busy parading themselves in courts using our tax monies @Moshoeu Mabusela we are just their puppets that whats wrong with us .... Our voices are on MUTE 
2:13:09,2:19:13, @African Refugee Absolutely ! "@ African refugees I understand clearly about your concerns which is everyone concerned not to repeat same thing Zuma did but here it clearly not the same There we have it URGENCY again!!!!! Is he telling me that he was involved in nothing wrong ? "Why do Courts in ZA still use paper in the form of files and affidavits etc  "Corruption is so clear to everyone @jasper dougal leat of our worries .... all will get stolen "When a person tries to overcome due process  Link to EISH!!!! Bring it on!! More please. 
2:19:23,2:27:34, @Moshoeu Mabusela exactly that is my point CR17 clearly he facing Zuma coz we have seen his representatives opposing Gordhan appealed so it was clear that he is fighting back no doubt Zuma can't afford NOT to fight back. This is the end-game for him. He knows nothing .... if people come to you not knowing you and asks you to sign something ... what do you do ? "@ Concerned South African he already started he come here to lied by accusations of his own people who was appointed by himself saying they were spying He knows nothing niks Nara zilch @Spykerhond ... I agree with you that if the 25k viewrs are representative of the the electorate then 57% of them are criminals as they voted for the ANC and are accomplices to the ANC's looting "Fight back is already started PG did warn us back two years ago "South Africans 
2:28:33,2:36:27, Fightback is intense. Bad for our reputation. Just see the flight of foreign capital from our shores. Tough times ahead.... @Moshoeu Mabusela I agree She is always poorly prepared amandaa politicians are draining our energy with these negative news on all TV channels. Are we citizens so ignorant that we can allow all these to continue. "I stated very clearly before that i am not interested with politics but I look at the problem "Let those who were involved in corruption face the full might of the law. Law abiding citizens should get services promised "Pp is entertaining those people whom make accusations and do as they please @makhosi nobhatyi I think the leak of the Bosasa donation to the DA was done to deliberately by Bosasa. 
2:36:56,2:48:33, "Cyril Ramaphosa and Pravin Gordhan are the same as everyone. The must also receive the full might of the law. The PP must do her work Sthakathi Khumalo so glad you are an attorney... "@ Ann M. I think that was a plan of Zuma and Gavin Watson to get CR17 on the muddy so that confusing him in fighting corruption "SAP Corruption is not a new phenomenon. "Apart from ventilating our many concerns about corrupted politicians and officials again: Why the Zuma cronies not wanting the public to hear the proper version of these events we are hearing now? Karen x so glad you are an advocate 😄 "@Sthakathi khumalo PG stole no money sir so no serious crime 
2:49:40,2:52:27, we are on Estina dairy farm hearing "@Moshoeu Mabusela NDPP Batohi is busy cleaning house at the NPA. In the meantime "@Ben Cole. I suggest that all citizens march in the streets let me put it on record the Guptas will never return to South Africa "makhosi nobhatyi They must clear their names using the right avenues!! We cant have media cleaning their laundry It is the stragetical to disturb the commision of inquiry "@Smart Guys Not voluntarily waste of money Anne that will never happen

"this clearly state that our government system is a complete mess Anne that's why they went to Dubai and not India @Moshoeu Mabusela I read it in a news report. I'll look for the link. Dubai for holiday 1 year holiday @Sthakathi Khumalo that why PG approach courts to resolve this matter to rest we are witness We saw hawks wanting to arrest PG before prior to this allegation he rebuked and they scared to carryover 
2:55:52,3:06:49, the Guptas have enough cash to have plastic surgery to make them look like dogs. then get mounted by a big boar "Check the rates for water and electricity for the whole year We are not saying people must not face the law but state institutions must not be the tool to fight political battles which is we have seen happening before and now "Hospitals are run by comrades. Patients do get healthy meals The flipping of pages hehe!! Its like how they were stealing money at the farm project "@Moshoeu Mabusela it a pain sir "The situation is bad in the country "Cry the beloved country... Lawlessness reign supreme in this country 
3:07:01,3:17:52, this country is where it is because of Zuma and his cronies big TSOTSIES "makhosi nobhatyi.. Where was Zuma in a Billion rand loss under the clean guys??

Soon we will be the same as Zimbabwe. fat heading there. "@Sthakathi Khumalo. let us stop factional debates here I believe their leadership things will change give them space to fix the company @Sthakathi Khumalo Zuma Must go to jail "Moshoeu Mabusela Ow well This mess we are in now is for past 9 years ago so you can’t expect changes at 16 months the executive board joined these entities give them benefits of doubt surely you will get something 
3:18:06,3:22:33, "@Smart Guys Zuma will say he never knew anything about all of this and he should not know "They said they have turn around strategies all state officials involved in corruption Must be sent to prison @Sthakathi Khumalo. your analysis is too narrow to say the least. Protecting Zuuma is not helping anyone. He messed our country big time with corruption. Be honest and real please.
