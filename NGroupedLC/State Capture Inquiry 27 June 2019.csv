19:22,24:22, is this mahlangu was mentioned yesterday on commision? yip hofmeyr enjoyable The aim of the commission is to gather the whole information and does its own recommendations before they take the report to the President to study the report and everything will be decided from there Yes he has a very arrogant opinion of himself.. I think he is preparing to set his senior officials up to take the heat off himself. "Can anyone enlighten me "uzombuza END BOER GENOCIDE zasha If the killing of white farmers does not stop there will be be no food to feed the masses in this country. 
24:45,27:18, loose association.

27:35,30:17, @Tich Ziny and they havent even gotten to the peak of questions @Jayden Bango @funicanz @Abel Matshidiso Justice Jafta just delivered the judgement. Jiba and Mrwebi remain on the Roll of Advocates. What a disgrace.. thanks to Ramaphosa. Notice the body language. Says yes while shaking his head. Did not want to concede the point. what did Ramaphosa do now "What Ramaphosa to do with courts some people are sick here impels Mtimande lol this guy looks scared 
30:17,31:35, @Born free what did Cyril do ramaphosa is not a judge he is a president of the country How is Mahlangu doing? zondo really enjoying his work today compared to the past two days @Born free Our judiciary stands tall by ensuring it is independent from the executive and make its well reasoned decisions. I have no idea what you think CR is - he is the president not the judge too. @Victor nothing material so far just the blah blah the guy seems jittery "cele are y joining the sick the guy looks uncomfortable @Born free they out of the NPA fired but they can be advocates not inside government they can open their firm 
31:40,33:26, @Jayden Bango He is feeling guilty? Ramaphosa dismissed the corrupt two but failed to say they should be removed from the Roll of Advocates. We will have to wait for Judge Zondo to make this finding against Jiba. cele did he agree that the money come to him "Its early stages @Victor they havent started really proding. he is explaining his work experience with reletive difficulty hai maan ramaphosa can not say nor do that he only appoints or dismisses as he correctly did so The witness comes across as being passively aggressive. Is he the SAA Mahlangu issue? yesterday 
34:00,36:14, Haha speed it up "@Victor No Mahlangu? is 400m or 500000 @Born free Its not my job to educate you but per our constitution t is not for CR to make that decision. Maybe you judst think this is some place were a President is the Lord of all. He is not. "We are happy Jiba and mrwebi out of NPA  "Verwoerd was the Lord of all "@makhosi nobhatyi correct "@Norman Zwane at may not be your duty to educate them but if needs be do it brother 
36:21,38:29, They are in breach of the Oath of advocates and should not be allowed to practise privately.. they are a disgrace. he is all over the show...not very bright as thought what is this about mlugisi it sounds like race comment if it is i d not think it is on topic please advise Hofmeyer knows these answers. Wants to just show he is all bluster. Eish this witness is starting to annoy me. He is all over "@Jayden Bango hi Everyone. when is Zuma appearing here? so we can finish this commission and arrest him "Let me correct something here Ramaphosa did want to strike of advocates the both two 1st week july 
38:45,40:28, "okay Here goes cant wait. this commission needs to end and he must go to prison. Its taking too long Advocates can work for KPMG not so easy to arrest..as legal procedures. take 10 years. I would say the only people who will be arrested are the whistleblowers well someone has to be arrested. and its pointing to him Judge is having a better day today he is so ill prepared..wat was he doing before he came to comm 
40:39,42:09, September makes it hard for him lol i just want action. weve heard enough stories now why is this state capture so surprizing to some people this is how africa functions it is actualy busness as usual going to take looong time to arrest zuma yes Judge "if we dont arrest even the police chief looks like a mafie boss then in the end he will say he was prejudiced and therefore the case is unfair @Norman Zwane yes they will be fired definitely because they were blocking ways of justice zuptas won’t do that constitutional court didn’t change anything from being unfit to hold office stayed 
42:43,44:20, "@clive oconnell KPMG This is looking more and more like chronological inexactitudes of others' experience. npa and hawks havent kicked off yet..battling to find honest prosecutors and cops..needle in haystack 24billion NPA even arresting their own now This lady looks like she is gonna panel beat Mahlangu he is all over the place they are all crooks even this judge. i dont trust him anymore 
44:34,48:01, @at least 1 agreeing with me and it includes the goverment and private sector off all of the country there are no angels here al the wings are of the same thing corruption "@makhosi nobhatyi I'm informed not by the politics of the country which would support dismissal judge has to be friendly as this is a commission.people are invited to assist.. shes the type of gerie nel you'll get behind bars broer hofneyr not so sharp..she left the banks and sbv out of sa express issue..for money laundering @Thembisa Odendaal very true yes its very easy to follow so y she leave out bank and sbv. 
48:05,50:41, @ Cassim suleman she call for an investigation ...especially for organizations which operated as banks its coming hang on but left banks out @cassim suleman ha ha ha dont stat this again please i thought i clarified to u why it was kept ouside the central theme no u didnt hoffmeyer is brilliant I feel so sorry for adv September shame she's shaky mhhh I think the judge just does not like her way of doing things just not clean in this business you must be so meticulous in your execution.. . yes please he is verbaly diahrea now he talks a lot ans say nothing this will not work the judge and advocate is sharp agree same thing will happen here. theyl come up with some terrible excuse. wasting our time 
50:44,56:08, This is linked to Crooked Dudu Myneni and her dodgy deal with BnP Capital. SAA planned to pay BnP R265 million in this dodgy deal and Myneni did not follow correct procurement procedures. agree BNP Capital was unregistered. @Thembisa Odendaal Ag my liefling Ms September sukkel die hele dag lank. I hope she is learning though. Experience cannot be bought and at times it obtained on a big stage which this one is. People have been eating money left right and centre. @cassim suleman the tranches of evidence (1&2) are particularly directed towards allegations emanating from the aviation sector. if banks colluded they will be handled separately This is going to be about another hijacked BBEEE company. So we have not yet established their (his) experience prior to the SAA funding deal. this chap is going like a bullet train 
56:11,58:11, "MS September is just nervous "According to David Cele @Norman zwane my heart goes out to her sometimes I'm so cross with the judge I'm saying give the child a chance ...everyone must start somewhere judge also some areas of lack so let's be compassionat @adrian albertyn I agree. @Thembisa Odendaal I also feel for her "Black sheep being lead to the cliff poor witness. he is going to Jian this one "No one will ever steal now they have seen or they will learn @david cele Do you consider Blade part of 'Zuma's cabinet' even when he was fired? 
58:18,1:01:25, these people could not get the chu chu train right now they jump for bullets typical Tony Yengeni is still living large. mis september is a top advocate her strat is to come across as soft but are just leading the witness into mistakes as thinking she is easy she is not. the judge is a bit harsh on her According to @david cele Senzo Mchunu was part of the 'Zuma cabinet'. Mngadis name is all over the show dudu myenis right hand man Mahlangu initially refused to comply with Zondo subpoena and took the matter to court. Eventually his lawyers agreed to withdraw and assist the commission. @david cele Where was he moved to by Zuma? minister of the taxi association and the burning of busses and trains 
1:01:35,1:04:00, who is us? when you having a meeting one on one "@adrian albertyn @Thembisa Odendaal Most of us had to learn the ropes not in the full glare of TV. On my first day as a teacher Not necessarily and I didn't is not the same thing. This oke just saw dollar signs.. @David cele DR Blade Nzimande did nothing wrong but Zuma see opportunity to punish him by firing him and approve free education and make him popular someone who was going to to that was CR @david cele Don't lie. He was kicked out of cabinet @Norman zwane oops tmi He's gonna crack soon.. i see bullets coming from the prosecutor.... Not Bullet Train thou Mr Mahlangu doesn't want to implicate himself in anyway. He is too jumpy. Myeni and Mahlanga conspired to defraud SAA of R265 million. 
1:04:35,1:07:12, this guy is ducking and is now blowing serious bubbles... ie talking rubbish... he lost his way Mahlanga is Implicated. he is becoming a suspect "Thanks @david cele Do you now admit? "@Thembisa Odendaal My colleagues made sure I never forgot that. I did not stay a year. I left for the private sector. Still cannot explain that stubborn erection Myneni and Mahlanga have been exposed in this dodgy deal. Guys I liked Mzimela very passionate about aviation yes has only a BA degree economics stats which I found to be a bit questionable to occupy such high executive positions nevertheless she knew her st the guy should just pay back the money..full stop 
1:07:16,1:09:34, @david cele Admit that you were not correct to claim that Zuma did not fire Nzimande @Norman zwane my heart goes out to you "@david cele Blade was SG of the communist party that had called for Zuma to step down corrupt @david cele What is a 'Zuma Minister'? @Thando this one is a corn artist This chap is just to smooth. This guy start by being defensive. Yes Thando she will open up like a surgeon 
1:10:33,1:14:37, @Thembisa Odendaal That was so long ago I just remember it as a big joke now and tell the story when I try help a nervous newbie to settle down and focus on what they can do best. Some benefit. "to all my brodaz out I want to let you know no more feel pressured by these BEE guys @thando it's so annoying because these guys make us look like fools because the are skelm enough to get their hands dirty and we look dum because here we are doing an honest days work @david cele It comes from your claim that this cabinet is a 'Zuma cabinet'. "Myeni is a delinquent Director @Buyiswa Mnyani Problem my brother is they are the same crowd that run our municipalities and wastefully spend our money. @Norman zwane well done to you always help a person I also believe in that he is stammering..he is nervous..he knows what happened This witness Mahlangu was protecting delinquent Director Myneni and the dodgy deal. 
1:14:55,1:16:31, cele have u any proof that Matamela is a crook or was he fou2 guilty of such by any court of law "this guy must spill everything this guy what's wrong with him talking about the .CA and masters guys now he wants to hide behind them I don't think this one has matric mark my words this advanced diploma is fake @david cele Name those people in this cabinet. Mahlangu is a conartist "Yes Hoffmeyer LOCK HILLARY UP ! @Thembisa Odendaal I'm old enough now to know better than to think I can last forever or be a gate keeper. It is best to see oneself as a custodian for others or shell meddle in your election too 
1:17:25,1:21:01, this Prosecutor is drilling holes in this Mahlangu's intergrity. @Norman we need many like you my brother then the universe is more supportive This guy is explaining even before he is asked the question I suspect that you don't even know who is in the cabinet @david cele he always says we and i lol not i its he repeating this? I see our hacker is on steroids this morning What you talking about not covering up ANC corruption? ANNC is all about covering up corruption. 
1:28:21,1:39:37, @PEACEFUL HEART Yep - ANC is corrupt to the core. Constitutional Court dismisses bid to debar advocates Jiba and Mrwebi They remain advocates someone give a quick summary what happend this morn so far Absolutely But a high court may be approached on the strength of Mokgoro commission findings The Johburg bar wanted them to be removed or disqualified. It has nothing with them being fired by the president from the NPA. @Mduduzi Thabede No court is higher than the Constitutional court Ayeye! Gavin watson asked to come sort out his tax affairs with SARS (This is like getting an enema or bowel flush on boxing day morning). Can this be the beginning of Kiessewtter getting hands dirty 
1:40:19,1:43:29, indeed Gavin Watson will appear before SARS you cant just agree when it comes from an credible source.. all aspects need to be investigated she's going to get him watch Gavin Watson will be out of this country faster than a speeding bullet with his bags of cash. Probably has Hundreds of Millions off-shore. "@Mzalwane Mzala Spot on. Jiba and crew might be happy so far. At least This guy thinks he's gonna get away with his smooth criminal operations ....through you chair Geez I wish the SABC could afford a Mixer with a compressor/limiter. Whomever is trying to operate it is useless gavin is in london as we speak or write 
1:43:52,1:45:00, why the fudge BNP was a scam corporate favoured by Dudu Myeni to raise R14.3b SAA wanted. This boy is going to go down in flames quite slowly bcoz he's trying to be smart after the fact. @Dan Brown I just wish i could be Watson's friend or spokesman...jeez. but you need back ground Agrizzi has been ordered to pay R200 000 "This Mahlangu guy must be honest @ongama I thought what nonsense is this guy talking SAA has neem a long standing company "Agrizzi will pay that cash 
1:45:22,1:47:33, same with eskom and then they het their friends to open a pty and laundry money though said new business @Thembisa His lies are getting out of hand! @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Most of Gavin's friend were Zuma back side lickers by employment -izinsila zikaZuma SAA is an albatross to the national fiscus @Norman Zwane LOL there is so many people involved in this i cant keep track anymore this guy is a fake listen how he rolls his tongue when he says firm because he wants to look like he knows something and then he can't say possibilities hayi sika maan YEs Chair ask that questions!!! 😀😀😀

1:49:29,1:51:19, these are the guys parading with expensive cars around from stolen monies.. i see some jimmy manyi traits here BnB and Myeni would have succeeded in defrauding SAA of a further R265 million if this scam had not been stopped. "@Jayden Bango me too Guys there's a light in this tunnel I've learnt so much from the commission nowadays people don't mess with my written communication because I will spin them serious words learnt from the commission He’s not answering the question @KEITH SINDILE DINABANTU Your own parents would disown you from the smell even though you had the millions like Khulubuse who owned a sports car he could not climb out of. @Thembisa Odendaal hahhahahahahahahha I'm dead sisi He's evasive 
1:51:33,1:52:29, @Norman Zwane He should just stop trying to be clever and tell the truth. @Norman Zwane Hahaha.
