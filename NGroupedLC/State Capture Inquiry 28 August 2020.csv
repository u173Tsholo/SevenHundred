8:33,12:47, "...Anon Mpofu? Going to take the whole day just to bring an application postpone or something. This is an advocate who can’t be concise...long winded saying little..He’s another time waster mpofu don't postpone!!!!! Looks like he is gonna get it postponed The advo just want to spend alot of time in here just to charge alot of money """ IT LOOKS LIKE MR ASBESTOS ?? WANT QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE """ WHAT A WASTE OF STATE MONEY our Tax money.... 😭😭 
13:17,16:12, yo U remember mr Nzeku i saw the judge becoming irritated because of mr Nzeku not knowing over 2 million which went to his account This is almost like accepting that there is something to hide and he's saying - I dont want to have to talk about something that I might be hiding or not hiding. "@Exactly 2mil going in the account and you dont notice hahahahaha eish our tax what a waste his is so nervous lol want Agrizzi arrested? it's just entertainment.. 
16:43,18:08, """ MR ASBESTOS MUST ONLY CLARIFY THE PORTIONS OF DE EVIDENCE WHERE HE IS IMPLICATED""" if it was us poor people we would have been behind bars but because this are rich fat cats they keep on waisting more tax payers money nomvula makonyane should be arrested Is Mpofu the best legal brain? "We shall when the commission ends "they came to steal Mpofu won so many legal cases SARS must give all my vokken tax back. I tired of these people stealing my money! When will these crooks be prosecuted and locked up. We as tax payers are paying millions for a reality show! 
18:20,21:35, mayb he is cheap Senior councils are too expensive SARS is scam.... Y'all remember Mr nzeku got 28 million but never paid tax they ware'nt even doing a follow up ...Agrizzi is a real chess player of a sorts. Not even the Law can displace his version as the format of the corruption in Africa. Mpofu gets the bag in all angles... Don’t ever underestimate mpofu The man has a legal brain wasting money this the real corruption actually. leave zuma alone you jealous people. Zulus must realise and stand up in Natal. Chairman is too smart for this:elbowcough: zondo commission is captured 
21:48,23:08, i agree its captured 🤣🤣 someone was getting R2mil per annum for just reading a newspaper hahahaha eish. This scene has been repeated over and over ..... Mpofus arguments just waste time captured by who? Captured by who??? 😂😂😂 Mr Ndzeku when did u get married? Answer . I don't know. Mr Ndzeku do u remember the 2.8 million that went to your account. Answer. I don't remember captured how.explain comrades in comments sometimes things like nyoape boys 
23:10,25:33, das true it's captured..just think of the building they're renting..very funny :elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: "get involved in bitcoin now comrades are captured in the comments 🤣🤣🤣 Strangely enough the main whistle blower Mr Agrizi was arrested guys.He is out on 20K bail!!! "I’m not underestimating his legal brain chat mrs Rose for more info Lol 😂 but the commission is still hearing evidence and crossing examining some of the accused 
25:37,27:57, Well said! "When I get arrested its only recent that the commission has been given rights to share whatever information they have with the police.people will b arrested watch the space The commission has cost thus far 700 MILLION RANDS 🤦‍♂️ And counting This commission is just a joke at its best. I just wondering what action is going to be taken after this Blah...blah...blah He is repeating himself Legal people are word peddles wish Dali Mpofu could stop trying to sound intelligent and be simply. 
28:05,31:01, everyone will use that excuse from now on Human rights come first I am watching corruption politic or equal right of human "This commission has been very helpful by opening the eyes of lay south africans as to the extent of the rot in government. I can now make a wiser choice with my vote Equal right He is trying to sound intelligent exactly my point Don’t betray your own black nation☝🏼👊🏼✌🏼 "@Giovanni 
31:09,34:28, there we go @Luthando Xhamlayo - Pretorius agrees Elderly couple out on R100k bail each for allegedly defrauding SARS of R53m. If these people were arrested why are these govt thieves not being arrested. Bring freedom to people before I lost my temper @Derek Govender -exactly Jacqui thanks. It is very true. I will be very disappointed at the reasoning abilities of the Chairperson if he doesn't forsee the danger Make Africa be better country @Luthando Xhamlayo - Mpofu has his own agenda I will watch out in every step of this hearing day 
34:29,36:29, Mpofu is overconfident .There is a collection of many words in his sentences. He is not my best lawyer really. I wish he could articulate and be brief to the point without loosing the context. who will have the Netflix rights to this fiasco? I hope it'll be the state because we can use that to invest in our people and country "not every suspect/accused will get arrested. by the way mpofu is overrated!! Thabo but this looters should be arrested... Mpofu NOT my best lawyer #mpofunotmybestlawyer "Mpofu must get lost  Death will be the sentence of whom is hurting innocent African people. @Ndumieh exactly 
36:35,41:35, "I agree งานแห่งคนลง ด้านหลังกองลม COVID is coming to bad people and for who has betrayed his own black nation. Jail is not for Rich People here in South Africa qhubekani niVote asinamona mnxn "so Mpofu cant even make a clear point "No more jail time even if we want change whom are we going to vote for.????...I'm a black person but imma tell you this I DON'T TRUST A BLACK MAN IN POWER. "this shows that the world we live in is F**d up Once more Mpofu has succeeded to unleash an legal debate that just stall the proceedings 
42:27,45:22, When did Mpofu start representing thieves? "Donald @Donald - Julius Malema can answer that for you It's a shame to FS people 💔 Tjo does Mpofu have a comeback for this They deserve justice. Truth or Dare "😂😂😂@Tumelo...to delete a tweet....is equivalent to ""Chechela morago""=ho haleya" pretorious is spitting facts!! 
45:28,47:20, COVID is here waiting to give for ppl who is bad ones 🤣 @Daniel 😂😂😂 "let the man come to the stand...this ""right to remain silence"" thing is raising eyebrows" 😂😂😂🤣 Mpofu will politicize facts presented COVID is not real wena Everyone can also choose to remain silent then "@Derek Govender I am not aware of any DA politicians caught stealing 
47:50,49:47, HE CAN'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT Auntie Pat before she left @Mike have you seen the audit reports?? "@Zweli EFF is lead by corrupt people  yes its commen knowledge. they have the text message used. but let her go instead of processing. was better for all. "@Mike Ckark: yes. because some DA "Mokena vote for Herman Mashaba "EFF NEEDS ANGER MANAGEMENT Who believes DA🤔maar?you can't be a player and be referee at the same 
50:02,52:18, "This guy is an ANC cadre so whats his problem? ""Did u steal from poor?"" Yes No?. Yes ppl let's go for better devils okungcono A witness deemed cooperative is becoming elusive. To the chairman I hope you being fair equal for justice. @Daniel Norman Daniel the audit was independent.lets give some credit? No? stutter stutter Here we go again .... blah...bla Well said Mr. Pretorius who supposed to answer today? 
52:33,54:17, @Wendy Greeff well its more blah blah money blah longer I blah stand blah here the richer blah I blah blah get. Children should have better life and nothing is impossible. mike Clark. have u seen the audit report sir? what's mpofus problem kanti???? just advise your client otherwise. "@Zweli Mkosana @Mike I've been in long in this country and i know and understand whats happening in both private and government sector. @Nkululeko You hit the nail on the head "@ Nkululeko "@mat kho off course would you like a copy 
54:52,56:32, @Derek enkosi!!! in my view Mr pretorious putting it well as the rights of mokgesi but terms of reference for state capture inquiry been upheld too. Zuma was the best president I'm telling you "If the witness has a single version "@Mike seeing that you are adamant the audit report is reliable  Moshozi aowa kea gana "@Daniel Norman BIG question who is supposed to take the stand? who is winnies toy boys client today NDUMIEH. I SUPPOSE YOU BELIEVE IN FATHER XMAS 
56:40,57:49, zuma was unique did not steal a cent was his own words and he was right he stole billions @Ndumieh Mokoena why are you saying that? TROLL "Stick with rule TROLL "@Daniel Norman on Zondo we have seen cash in millions counted out drivers witnessing bribes He is boring us to death now. @Wendy Greeff yes enough already "Adv Mpofu's plot is not convincing at all 
57:51,59:53, ndumieh must b living in a different country Fake information stutter Stutter:elbowcough::elbowcough::elbowcough: This guy is protecting Ace no one else. @ Mike again the question arises why are they not being arrested???? Cos they are politicians right does nobody know whos mpofus client today?? you can't say Zuma was best because remember he had almost 90% support from NEC of ANC.... That's why he was abusing his powers without any consequences from then NER.... In all these activities in this commission did the commission summoned Bosasa to come and make submissions 🤔? Let the Judge make that call. 
1:00:21,1:03:01, The judge is watching That is wrong and againstvthe purpose of the State Capture "The fact of the matter is that all these incriminated ANC bigwigs will never be jailed mpofu is talking nonsense.... Mpofu will be victorious it seems judge is now sympathysing? no bro zuma was trouble man championing corruption in these country. @Deon ....as a company that was at center of all the controversy not its employees coming to testify against certain members... Mpofu argued the same thing in a previous commission where Tom Monyane was to appear. In the end they said they didn’t accept that commission as a legitimate body. It’s Dali’s tricks 
1:03:07,1:04:27, everyone who's taking a stand here is not charged we are gathering evidence hence we need cooperation Seems like his client is waiting to be arrested haha "I doubt he will escape with it I can’t remember the name of that commission who is his client? ppl watching but seems nobody knows He is repeating himself again a Mr Nxesi? his client is Tim mokhetsi As a company? What a stupid comment. Watson as the CEO was supposed to come and died just before? Agrizzi? All the other workers. 
1:04:57,1:06:13, "we don't care bring him we've had one of those the ""I DON'T REMEMBER GANG "" before" His client is Mr Mokhesi from the Asbestos projects @jabu - Mokgetsi we are not free Hawks must dive NOW the bring winnies boyfriend for a reason. he is an expert spin doctor..zondo will postpone again we are not free "@Daniel Norman This sums up SA mess Prof Ndletyana UJ says ""the ANC cant elect honest people & risk exposing themselves & thier corruption"" so you have to be corrupt to be in the ANC SAFM 2/8/20" "The only person in the ANC who was ever held accountable by conviction is John Block 
1:06:55,1:07:44, 1 hour wasted Judge stamp his authority we want answers for our tax money's that they stole. 😠😠😠 The witness mist take stand Chair evil anc chair bring that man to the STAND...!!! government must fall C’mon judge..assert your authority \\\\\ 
1:08:00,1:09:55, GMF GMF "only 3 prominent people have ever been jailed for corruption in 30 years. Shaik but stand to deffer Wt those who say Mr mpofus arguments are unreasonable in this case come back Jesus On a lighter note folks am curious to know how many sheets of paper was used thus far cos theres millions of pages of evidence and how many trees does that equate to!!!! as SA'ns citizens one day we must take a stand and boycott the ANC looters guys... demand removal one tree agree @Ndumieh 
1:09:58,1:11:05, This is turning into the Zondo circus - all the 'witnesses' can apply for postponements on the day that they are supposed to appear? Advance warning? @William i have my doubts "Why they always say my last submission "Derek I would say we've cut down a forest or two for just this hearing... but the trees aren't complaining so... This Mokhesi guy will take the fall for Ace @Jabu offcourse i do!!! hi everybody we all must join peaceful protest on 5th September MO 
1:11:24,1:13:45, @Ndumieh Mokoena - I hope that day comes soon 🙂 move one million "If in the end the commission recommends that e.g Nomvula Mokonyane should be prosecuted Dali is a delinquent lawyer..always fighting for his client NOT TO answer questions at a commission..Sickening.. a snake when it comes to how his clients were involved in corruption When Ace becames the president all those who are loyal to him and his schemes will handsomely rewarded :stayhome: Attie tell us more I'm around Cape Town.... we are tired of this people they chowed 500 billions in 1 month..... adv Pretorius is 🔥 dali is doing what he is paid to do and what he is qualified to do. it is his job and nobody should berate him for it 
1:13:47,1:15:27, @Attie where's this peaceful protest gonna be? Union buildings? Get in the point please go to facebook and search move one million The law protects the criminals with money mpofu loves rights!!!! The ABC ain't on fb he is a great defender of crooks ye#sssssssss Not quite

Dominic are u from Cape Town ? lets see if he will be able to notice the questions properly... 😂😂😂Mpofu shakes his had from the start... Yes 
1:42:32,1:44:20, "@Gift Mazibuko The Comission should know by now @Dominic true...
