time,10:59,message Sesikhona This witness is not well prepared. How many times has he been told to find out things and provide information to the commission? hello @Thando Nkutha A simple question of whether or not they had an overdraft? eish ran out og data @Thando Nkutha Correct and a lot of the information is in the public domain @Anne M. True..They were indicted in 2018 
12:03,25:24, There were 3 directors at Regiments Capital Agree - they were selective about who they checked. My bank wouldn't release my bonus until they received confirmation from my employer that it was genuine transaction. why has Salim not been arrested already ✊🏿eff i think the government should give tax payers to option to claim their tax back from the Guptas and BOSASA Never ever again in my lifetime will we be colonised by Indians ✊🏿eff "@Thando Nkutha Yup Nationalise eskom ✊🏿eff The chat is more intelligent and on point today. Thx guys.. I blocked those persons yesterday who came to talk rubbish on here..

Let's discuss hat we HEAR about the evidence... @Thando Nkutha And that's where I start to get seriously p-d off. Ghost employees here The only way to fight this battle is move fast to government institutions because of those who were following Z stl using government resources to fight the current President especially treasury Millions always. We hve been robbed of billions to these thieves.. it is really sad to see how our beautiful country has become a place where outsiders can just come and do as they please. From the Guptas to false pastors and the government is not doing anything @wetton paulse But they want our votes "Hey who is this Salim Issa ? Tjooo he is dangerous 
35:21,40:19, @Margareth Waterboer precisely @welton paulse true..imagine a pastor raising a person here but ebola is killing his people there in drc but he doesnt go and raise them makhosi nobhatyi he worked for the gupta's he is buddies with Koko and other ANC members. like the guy that visited the Shabeen. @ makhosi nobhatyi Essa is the Gupta''s state capture engineer... He ran Eskom from outside as we heard.. "@Felix Muyoba @welton paulse is like these black magicians who tell people that he will make them rich but they themselves are walloping in poverty..thats bull!

Look what happened with the Guptas. they told the commission they can give their evidence via Skype. they are mad @Desmond Masilela again a sign that they dont take our country and its law seriously.

That is what they told the Chair. They gone now will never see them again. Meanwhile uBaba Ka Duduzane is carrying on with his life as per normal neh Which law?

1:41:12,1:43:34, "Presidents look at its people as just another vote for him and not as an individual "@Jngle Pssy You might want to fight a different way by voting ANC out and use your university brain to not vote like sheep. ANC Corruption "Unemployment rate 1983 = 13% Unemployment 2018 = 27% Eish @Wild do white care abt an African child or they care about dogs and cats more than a black child? @Magda Seguin ...Cause they can't handle it.....true can you imagine an 82 year old running for an office?!! only in Africa 🤣😋 @marks you must care for you own children. We owe you nothing. You want to fugga you must look after what you make yourself People are fleeing from Africa to Europe dying in boats in the Mediterranean sea...African leaders should be ashamed I guess you don't know the stats on who looks after all the orphaned children on SA. who helps them the most. we voted NP out to make better life for all the Zumas ANC came and fokked it up.

We will rather look after our dogs and cats. I Of communism doesn’t support communities how did African true leaders before capitalism survive? Don’t tell me your distorted history that was designed to discredit African and hide the fact that whit White people were the poorest in this world hence they travelled to look for greener pastures Mark name them "@marks what am i wacthimg 
1:47:35,1:49:30, @Magda poverty is unreal in Africa. Proper governs can help channel growth and sustainability Mark when did Africa first invent the wheel. sorry don't mean to down anyone else just the hard head. So called traditional leaders oppressed women and still do If indeed whites were living in heaven why did they travel? A men who travel to unknown without his family is because of hunger @marks mokwena ...Gee Bra.....who built this City/Country........thick Bra....think.......only bush before the settlers arrived to make this country prosper......true story I rest my case with marks mokwena...he is totally captured by populist ideologies Who said african would have not built it?

It’s not race but systematic political power designed to disadvantage a black child it's called Monet laundering @marks mokwena ....CHEERS 
2:08:40,2:12:15, "Thando💯🙋🏼‍♀️ bye @worldoflosttanks Mike 🙋🏼‍♀️👌🍾🙌🏼 I'm lost from eskom to Sahara to cutting edge. what was going on guys? it's called money laundering. washing the movements of money "Hello South Africans "Fox So the Guptas was heavily involved in money laundering? it will be the same way they trace the VBS money movements. cant hide it. R1 is R1 it does not disappear when moved around it leaves a breadcrumb trail. just need to follow it. 
2:12:27,2:16:10, big time yes Eslon who in this world can pay cash for a $46.000.000 house in Dubai. where did that money come from. More than involved and banks since 2009 had an international mandate to Reg flag money laundering. So the question will be who was the inside man at the reserve bank? it's a Gupta company who's cutting edge? Choosing people for positions based on race rather than merit was always gonna end badly for Eishkom. Non existing shell companies like what Enron was doing "...Where religion controls the minds Thando it was a receiving company in the chain of the belt of laundering 
2:16:26,2:23:57, Lee 💯🤔👌 Santosh Choubey. owns Cutting Edge and works for Guptas. same as Trillian and Eric Wood But people are pathetic also. what was the reserve bank doing all the time with all this red flags? R50 000 000 in one day hheyi ayile imali ama GUPTAS people must be arrested Guys this worrisome what did the reserve bank do if all this revelations are out bcos of this commission? ½ a mil is to little Eslon and SARS but we know someone was placed there to stop looking into this. and SSA too. because they stealing SA money from the govt Lets not fool ourself politician are all the same.lairs. 
2:24:17,2:29:22, it all moves away when Corrupted buk "Cigar Fox.. That is a question So R 50 000 000 could be transferred in one day and reserve bank will not raise red flag. like really? This thing is really deep "@Eslon Eslon If it was between SA bank accounts Elson et about standard bank it self.happening on their saver on daily basis. "These are ridiculous amounts enjoyed by a few while the masses suffer we know that Zuma visited Dubai 2 times in two weeks and send other MPs through Dubai around the same time. and some people say they had cash and diamonds with them but that is to be proven. "@Thando Nkutha And this is why Standard Bank's legal rep is here next investigation is to see where the money went to where it is now. 
2:30:06,2:33:22, and why SARS did not get involved Tom Moyane bra The corruption tentacles stretched far and wide If you deposit 36K form a foreign account Standard freezes your account and request you to provide proof It wz now bigger dan Nile River @Anne M. Are you saying the reserve bank can't monitor transactions between local banks? @Thando Nkutha Then the bank's relationship manager/s should also be investigated. think std bank..slipped up big time..case of recklessnness not on daily basis.they have KPMG.who work as an oversite 
2:35:01,2:39:08, Blaming games no one will going to win.solution now. @Cigar Fox 😉 Bring all the corrupt people back from overseas\ "The Guptas own Africa financially reserve bank had been informed by banks...they did nothing @Thando Nkutha. what was the financial intelligence centre suppose to do? Elson think they are corrupt too "@cassim suleman Look at the timing. When did the banks inform the Reserve Bank Denel also involved It takes sometime to camp any like Sahara to make revenue of about 10m e year.but they were making it per day 
2:39:32,2:44:21, eish Wakanda not solution pls now we want to know when you informed the authorities about the money movements """To disguise the source and recipient of money.""" No Standard Bank is an accomplice Denzel and Transnet amen Wakanda forever 🤙🤙🤙 They are guilty for not reporting it. but to who. if it was government then they would not act. 
2:44:22,2:46:50, Cigar thanks for the lesson let's fix this mess ner the tiger man will kill these traitors of wakanda who is wakanda😟😟😟😟 Wild not to government processes were not followed here. agreed @Toni john The fictitious country in the movie Black Panther. as socialism looms I very much doubt that All this problem bcos of one man Jacob Zuma then now 
2:46:54,2:49:23, "Thanks This corruption affect the unborn guys is not a game. it's not because of one man it's the party that elected that one man after he was convicted of rape "@Thando Nkutha Correct Nkosini - the tap was running and they also were happy to charge and ""eat"" too." the man is gone that same party is still there All of them that took cash in a bag are just as guilty. Wild agree @Kapn Krunch May be gone but casting very ling shadows South africa was equal to England in my parents time the rand was 3 times the dollar that's what happens when africa has competent governance 
2:50:17,2:54:18, To me the banks are somehow to be blamed here. Banks have no reputation. Alway chasing the margins and bonuses for their top management. when they hit us with sanctions we got stronger because they need us we dont need them Zonda needs to give instructions now not wait until the end of SC. people need to be arrested. otherwise the process will fail the same as the Banks and other areas that should have taken action. billions were taken under their watch.yes they dint controll our money but huge amount of money ridiculous. "@Michael Wild If I remember correctly Cigar come with it.if it gonna stop the vultures is ok. Anne yes but still no action. we need the wheels to turn. our country is not only run by idiots our countries voters are idiots 
2:54:40,2:58:22, Those guys started to make booking fo Berry Roux. @Kapn Krunch You a bigger idiot for even thinking there was a glorious past when the rand was ... who cares? or you get names faster. like we work at this companys you going to jail for 30 years. but each name you give gets you 2 months less. the chickens will talk. Banks have benefited just like the audit firms. They are just being defensive because they are exposed. Thando agree no it benefitted everyone the statistics show it @Kapn Krunch ...spot on 
2:58:26,3:01:14, the ANC has treated it's people worse then a government who considered other races second class citizens "@Luvuyo Zantsi Sorry bru Banks should bring back South African's money. south africa is dying and if the next elections dont show a drastic change then the great exodus begins @Kapn Krunch ......things just worked for all...back then......let's face it bye for now. so triggered by the truth @Luvuyo Zantsi Now we cant even find our local Europeans. @Kapn Krunch is stark raving mad to think so.He must be locked with all other denialists. @Cigar Fox ...I'm a free man...my Bra
