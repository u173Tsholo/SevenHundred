19:44,20:55, He has no reason to lie. we just need the hole truth today I think he is here to add spice but let’s see if he can pull a Mzwanele Manyi Gordhan must be careful what he says otherwise it will backfire We will get the truth. when is Malema appearing before the commission? He seems to have more information on everything and anything happening in the country "siba mfabe eish he looks nervous Corrections already😩😩 
21:10,22:55, @Singi Mathebula the EFF said they'd go last. they want to wait for everyone to lie first "@Glorify Gumede Whatever sails your boat...so maybe ""enjoy"" would be appropriate" @Norman Zwane often commissions discover what is already in the public domain and in most cases nothing happens after "@Hound  "Gordhan is about to lie Zondo is too slow for me nervous off-cause Can we just here the testimony and not prejudge. @Norman Zwane it's a pity you can't grasp sarcasm in this context 
23:08,25:53, The EFF are marching against Pravin Gordhan today but they were together in the crook place defending him before. That's the superior logic of the Reds of London. he is being pressured because of he is turning around SOE so the looters are not happy go Pravin! moer hulle! EFF are just .....sorry for them That guy is a crook. I feel so bad for white South Africans. This has to be the most corrupt goverment in modern times. "Yho!! Data is the new privilege "@Glorify Gumede I think you are mixing your metaphors here; how does one ""discover"" what is already in the public domain "do you think that Gedleyihlekisa will give his cooperation when he comes. i think he is just going to laugh at everybody. but he must come "@Norman Zwane indeed thanks for pointing that out 
26:05,28:08, "come on minister "4 pirates 1 chiefs "@Wesley Myburgh: I dont he will come "William Makgalwa- you are walking on very thine line with sucgh stereoptype and general statement about the Indians. Becareful when is Thuli Madonsela cumin to the commission ? "Lisa Foster - why do you only feel sorry for white South Africans. Corruption has hurt all South Africans Thuli is their secret weapon "Siba Mfabe "EFF outside protesting agaisnt Gordan who implicated Tom Moyane 
28:28,29:47, Sam...I don't regret abt the statement it is a fact ... "Sorry I'm late @koena exactly this is not going to go well. Pravin thinks this is his press conference. so he doesn't like being asked questions that may exposed him Norman. i also think so. he will dodge this inquiry. “Superior Logic” 😂😂😂 "This guy has played to the crowd with great assistance from baba ka Duduzane "there is a first excuse lol their superior logic is amazing 
29:48,31:46, maleme will testify next year around july But do you understand what EFF is protesting about? "William "I cant wait for this one to fall in his sword people when you what ro respond to someone specific on this live chat. how do you the orange mark on the name??? Ders no harm mms more than prepared for that exercise "khowane EFF only there to support Moyane hmnn how many skeletons are lurking at Sars against EFF? "Pravin is too arrogant though 
31:52,33:43, "@Hound "Commission Chair is listening attentively to Pravin "Jeer Zondo listening tentatively "the judges will scared to judge him "Siba Mfabe We need a commision of inquiry into Limpopo Capturer by On-Point Engineering looooollll Gordon o tlo idibala "@Mgcini Tshwaku ""tentatively""?" 
33:43,35:15, he controls everythng in the ANC including Mr president himself Interesting 🤔 Pravin cabal in attendance He has no reason to lie his crocodIle smile His talking as if his reading the budget speech. @Hound I’m neutral but the same applies to the “EFF anti-Gordon” train But even his opponents don't show any facts against him even the eff brigades are just making spurious allegations. Is it the very Pravin EFF and other political parties were defending? 
35:49,38:31, @Mgcini Tshwaku Pravin is very interesting character; He seems to have made as many friends as enemies. He is liked and disliked with equal passion in various quarters. "Keryn But why did they not report these things at the time?? That's the big question now. Pravin is a crook But who asked him to take the position of Fin Min after Nene was removed cause definitely not JZ EFF is the only part that revealed state capture "@Hound Keryn: ""Take EFF lightly at your own peril"" it's interesting bra Sam is defending them 
38:54,41:22, The eff were the first to celebrate his return after des van rooyen disaster. did anyone indicate interest to cross-examine the Prime Minister before the testimony commenced? I tuned in late "@Hound. Agreed mpofu will apply by Wed to cross examine "@Sandile Khowane Basaminyile Pravin will fall "Norman Zwane reading too much Apparently black Label first is protesting outside 
41:33,42:34, "allow for cross examination "read Minister Interesting question by Gordhan handreds of billions of rand ? @Sandile Khowane yes Mr Moyane via Mpofu SC already applied to cross examine Ereng cross examination "@Hound : All I am saying is anyone who ignores them ofcourse this one is a crook We not here for speeches baba 
42:44,43:45, If Gordhan is corrupt why there is nobody laid criminal charges against him up to this day. the chair must direct this process sellout Eeeeeh Zondo 🤔 The Devil himself is speaking "ladies and gentlemen. Mr Julius Sello Malema will be president next year. difficult to swallow lol eff bots @Thando Nkutha they already have his statement and know generally what he is going to say about them. Hence Mr Moyane already applied Zondo is smiling 🤔 
43:47,44:58, He doesn't look comfortable shame Instead he has been tried through the court of public opinion. "Pravin is trying to win hearts Pravin Gordhan must fall Tamaryn are u on nyaope @peter pott what a joke 😂😂 #PravinMustGo Pravin please protect us from yourself. lol Juluis is about to be declared bankrupt 
45:09,46:32, @ Peter pot lol "@Mkhululi Bushula By being member of the ANC means he is a crook Gordan stays to sweep clean the SOE's then after he can go "This is too much now "is this man addressing the nation he is talking about the damage in the ANC not him in the ANC and government malema n shiva Bu must answer for VBS "Keryn. the youth that were born in 2009 Is he presenting a paper .......? 
46:38,47:29, nope they are flat broke Very interesting that EFF is hellbent on stopping Gordhan while protecting Moyane. If Gordhan is guilty he has to be exposed but the conduct of EFF is very suspect. What are they afraid of. WHY??????? afriforum is declaring them not eff Somebody stop Pravin. He is going astray. We are not interested in theory. We want to know what happened during his tenure as far as state capture is concerned! LOL why is Pravin talking about tweets now? Dude likes playing victim because we all know he's probably the leaker. Solomon agreed "nature their names dont appear in the report @ronin 187. How do you highlight the name when responding to someone's comment? please assist. Gordan he is a WMC stooge. 
47:30,49:43, this Pravin Gordhan shitshow is giving me hot flushes. do we have enough armour for this war guys? phela Pravin is not a weakling and he has the full backing of media "He is here to give evidence on State capture I agree with u Solomon Guys i'm lost "look into stats SA. there are only +-6milion whites in this republic. Julius never swayed his message. He fights for black majority They are trying to intimidate him. "i'm really lost here But he is brave that's why they say he is arrogant. "@Desmond Masilela you just highlighted my name just now. Just type ""@"" before you write his/her name. You are doing it right" 
49:59,51:10, But he also has shares in businesses tgough🤷🏽‍♂️ he is not brave but dangerous PG must rush to the deets maan! we do not have the whole day who is he reading to? shouldn't this info be shared and let the lawyers lead evidence? kindly advise @Norman Zwane maybe you know? Which politician doesnt have business interests in South Africa? "@pjn2001 your dreaming. Read an economic textbook on monopolies of scale - globally he is not a chicken like the EFF leader's whom are big mouth We have always expected a push back from the state capturet's. @ronin 187. Really thanks couse it doesnt show on my side. 
51:26,53:11, "Anc is endangered to the point of Losing credibility in society "" this comes from someone who is serving as a minister in the same ANC government he is demonizing. whom does he represent?" he looks like an egg This man is like his reading bible. "Vusi The ppl who are dangerous are those who sold our country to the highest bidder.

56:58,58:26, @Frank Matau why r people so agitated about the procession of the commission today? there is no hurry here. If he is not done today he can always come tomoro etc. black racists of africa There are so many jokes and laugh going around here. "The ANC even currently is composed of largely members who are actually ""captured"" by MONEY from top to bottom.There is hardly effective branches." This guy is a lackey of white interests He is what is referred to as a gate keeper Thato is a lackey of black mediocrity Pravin's daughter - Anisha Gordhan made millions with the State while his father was head of Treasury "Jake Carrot

This is more of a political lecture than Inquiry submission pl I'm starting to think that Jordaan would have better answeres than this Gordhan. Give us Jordaan he must just tell us if he has meet Guptas. thats all we want to hear. "the biggest corruption and state capture are minorities who arrived in 1652 who still owns 87% of the land post '94 while others continue to be squeezed like sardines Pravin likes to watch movies!! These fictional stories he is pointing us to When is EFF coming to present its story

1:53:54,1:55:49, @Trucker what Pravin's is doing is what it is called adovocatorum consilium. The juicy part is still to come. @Mahlasela Kilson True . . . politicians take its citizens for fools and it is starting to show "we are taxed to death while others misuse our money "I can see we are all frustrated by Gordan evidence because we expected him to say I met the Guptas I think Pravin is a failed project of the Guptas! Who would later fall in the hands of white monopoly capital! @Sthakathi Khumalo. My point. this Commission is the waste of state money nje @sam motabogi: I never heard nobody ask him to that rubbish. @Sthakathi There's no such thing as WMC
