25:12,31:51, I want mine in Bitcoin @Madelein Huxtable. You have chosen Bitcoin i would go for GBP Gold is the new world currency @Madelein Huxtable no in hard cash please..i dont trust bitcoin..bitcoin will be crushing the markets soon I'm not sure if is the camera or the adv lady next to Mr Pretorius. Here face is totally different than her neck. But let me sit down and eat my humble pie. I understood exactly about how he explained about the reports....but Mr Pretorious does not...bathung 8 minutes....report explanatio not yet resolved Ewallet🤣 Lol really going into detail here 
32:01,34:07, The people in our building works with Bitcoin. They say that it will go up and peak in June. Please do not see this as financial advise Goodness!! the makeup on the young advocate lady next to Pretorius is pathetic @Eslon Eslon. 🤦🤦🤦 Eslon is it not the lighting in the room? we dont care abt make uo @Madelein Huxtable They have a vested interest in saying that if they own bitcoins. They want more people to invest in them so the value will go up. Feels like a pyramid scheme. "buy bitcoin @Derek Main you are right Is he dropping bombs or ? 
34:12,41:38, @what? i wont each to their own 😃 "Magda Seguin Eslon give her a break😂 @Derek Main - dont have money to buy it anyways Eslon - it might be the light that makes it look bad "@Madelein Huxtable In that case @Derek Main - thank you I was expecting some big bombs by this time. Nothing as yet. Who are the 30 officially top ANC members that media has spoken about? 
42:06,49:48, I will really miss you all when the commission ends @Desmond Masilela - I also thought so. But may be they are buying time for the notifications (2 day Notice when naming someone) "Where can one find a Louie Vuitton handbag that was a left over I also want a Louie Vuitton bag. 50K will be fine for now 😀😀😀 @Madelein Huxtable. I'm just confuse really. Mr Mcbride is here just to nail his former employer. Making a 'genuine errors TWICE...Haribo Judge *haibo bla bla bla bla bla "@Desmond Masilela 
50:18,55:06, also can't see the relevance or how any reliance could be placed on the testimony of a drunk and a murderer @Eslon Eslon. We were told his going to dish some bombs and nothing till now. viva anc viva They are really giving Mc Bride a hard time...what exactly is at play here? It's the first time a witness is so minutely questioned "Give him time I am asking that same question Magda😉 Magda. Maybe something big coming?? Being thorough for a reason?? @Eslon Eslon. But I understand why he has pull any plug yet. Is because of the Adv when he always say will talk about that in due course. Agree Desmond.....name dropping to come soon 
55:22,57:33, Thanks all...there may be serious stuff coming..I read in Amaghubane that there is a story of the alleged illegal surveillance by State Security of the Nasrec ANC conference which was thwarted Some imagined versions detonating bombs that sparks with wine in the bottle nooo guys version bombs ere not necessarily explosive or dramatic Huh? @Jane .Blamire. Mr Mcbride will be here for 2 days according to the chair. His now on a second day maybe he might finish next Monday. So at this time not Bomb shell has been pulled. what a big voice Jane. Blamire... Remember this guy will disturb Zondo's conscious bcoz he will implicate his younger brother Zuma again for Gaddaffi money he he he Imagined versions? Really? zuma is the legend 
57:53,1:03:37, The Judge is digging deep @ Nelson Musoliwa -McBride may take it literally and kill more innocent people McBride is unphased Zondo will want to use every opportunity to confuse Mcbride for his younger brother's sake Eslon Family and friends liaisons run deep in state capture "@TalentSibisi @Eslon u raise a very important issue involving conflict of interest on Zondo's part but he is regarded in high esteem the legal team shows competitiveness so fr Elson mr Zondo is a fair person hello to all my BANTU 
1:03:44,1:08:36, Hi to all the Caucasians Maybe the Judge should have refused himself but he insisted to be part of this testimony gud afternoon to all my coolies n hottentots Most of this sounds like cross examination not leading evidence VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL @Fils de l'homme You are a race baiter and a stupid person. Wow.... I like the way SC Pretorius is leading/cross examining the witness Do you know the difference? it's not about liking but facts Corbis he is more than that.the gd thing is not to entertain him. 
1:09:21,1:11:35, VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL @Michael Michael VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL "@Fils de l'homme - If you tos around on this forum molo @Madelein Huxtable freedom of speech "look at it this way my sister @Madelein Huxtable u hav no right to violate my freedom to speak @Fils de l'homme It must be your turn to use the family brain cell today? Use it wisely dude! "Quote...He [McBride] will testify to a range of matters and a range of disciplinary hearings 
1:11:44,1:14:43, "@Michael Michael For a moment I saw the garbage from fils de l'homme and then I realised I wasn't logged in. Now he has disappeared. Best block I ever did. I understand that but why do they change tactic with this witness and only did it a few times in between the testimony of others just thinking or drawing my own opinion but as I'm not a law expert but only trying to understand the working of the law @Fils de l'homme - it is not freedom of speech. TRANSVAAL belongs pre-94. Move on buddy My thinking is they are walking on eggshells here as so many state security people were involved This is becoming so boring now. @Khaya Nomoyi. Eishhh..... you right @Khaya Nomoyi and @Desmond Masilela - agree 
1:14:58,1:20:16, I reported Geldenhuys...harassment and bullying...this is not a platform to spew put hatred I think with the fact that when they started with this witness the was this cloud of conflict as the DCJ brother being implicated @Madelein Huxtable @Khaya Nomoyi. This team of Mr Pretorius is boring. I think I will only watch the team of Adv Maleka. This one is just wasting my data. True @James "@Desmond Masilela I am not sure the DCJ's brother is implicated as such. From what I understand (yesterday morning) @Jane I think the DCJ has proven beyond doubt that he is the man for this job No his brother chaired McBride's disciplinary Masilela you are right.What is the problem with differentiating these reports and move on? but i still believe the submissions made by the panel will be applicable at the end 
1:20:18,1:23:22, guys wait for Mr Mcbride he is a credible man he will soon drop those bombs @Khaya Nomoyi. Remember the other team is investigating Bosasa the other Guptas. So The Adv Maleka team is investigating Gupta I think some other issues as well. @Anne that is correct He is steadfast @frederick we need to be patient exactly Mr pretorius will soon find a way with Mr Mcbride still no smoking gun ie JZ is corrupt?? "@Magda Seguin Exactly @Eslon "OK 
1:23:29,1:29:20, cde McBride using StateCapCom to settle scores well done to him @Khaya Nomoyi. Thank you. "@Magda Seguin Eish @Eslon if it is it is pure evil Hi everyone Hi @Khanyi. AgeGracefully Sunday Times is a discredited rag It is the Sunday Times again Sunday Times is part of State Capture 
1:29:55,1:31:36, It seems Mcbride was a thorn in the flesh of the looters DCJ Zondo's level of contraction and attention span is on steroids. I have an attention span of a toddler Mzilikazi Wa Afrika was outed and the Sunday Times had their award rescinded due to the Booysen affair @Fatherland Loyalty and Socialism above all ​ VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL SARS Affair Remember it is Surve's publication VOTE for the FREEDOM of the TRANSVAAL @Quintin Jacobs Hi @Fils de l’home Yes also the so called SARS rogue unit

1:33:46,1:34:50, I used to buy it religiously until I read an article in Noseweek of what really went down criminals I feel like i can vomit when I see Fils name here Current PP is busy chasing after Pravin over the so called Sars rogue unit @Fils de l'homme wena transvaal province is history What’s the latest on Nomgcobo Jiba "Fils @Yolo More as the people of the TRANSVAAL "Thank you @Felix Muyoba - I told the dude 
1:35:28,1:36:12, It is Shivambu who again reported Pravin to the PP...The EFF are stirrers "Fils I think Fils is a paid troll to try and distract us from the commission. "Fil go n check how they executed people in pretoria @Madelein Huxtable he should go and live on another planet @Yolo More by forcing th government to have a referndum @Anne M.. And ppl keep on entertaining him Solly they were given until tuesdy to have an input.on the findings of the report by the President. @Thami Ngwenya who did? 
1:36:36,1:39:09, Transvall security branch Blocked Fils @Felix Muyoba - I think Fils belongs to the AWB 😀😀😀 "Fils Yolo just ignore him @Madelein Huxtable awb of the late terelanche (may his soul rest in peace)? Yip The apartheid racists are all over this thread "@Magda Seguin Yes

1:40:57,1:42:13, "@Felix Muyoba and @Madelein Huxtable I am not a racist Sunday times are bunch of embedded Journalists "We need each other in order to move South Africa forward "Most people that are commenting here are from different gorvement departments Sunday Times / News24 / ENCA are part of State Capture @peter pott. That is what irrittates me with this media. Expecially Sunday times. When you in trouble they put you front page with big face on it. Once you clear you name they put you in the middle of the page They remind me of the embedded journalists during the Iraq war who fed the world with US propoganda I dont work for goverment please
