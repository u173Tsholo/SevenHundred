time,7:16,message Every day passed is a day closer to 15 July! who appears today? Thuli Mpshe. Ex HR Executive and Acting CEO of SAA running late üèÉ buthelezi when did you join the money chain iwant miss Hofmeyer minaüò±üò±üò± @Bongani Ntuli Yes Yes and YES 
7:29,10:26, too much for hofmeyr..give others a chance thanx @ntuli seriously we don't want to be accused that we are not supporting our own but I'm afraid this girl did not even attempt public speaking at school it's really not fun watching her A lesson on how to spread the loot without a quote for BEE friends "As long as it is not miss 9th month shes ok its just that we re used to miss Hofmeyer morning @Thembisa Odendaal i am with u @bongani ntuli you are very kind 
11:32,15:55, when Duduzile is coming to answer for herself iwill even take leave on that day Maybe she‚Äôs preparing for üöøZuma "In such day with such huge involves there is a need for a very experience and sharp-mind to asked the questions & the follow ups it must be Maleka or miss Hofmeyer on that day otherwise we wont get the truth what a coincident Duduzile and Duduzane lool "Mis Buthelezi eishhhhhhhhhh yaaaa neh you must always be suspicious when they have a postgraduate diploma from the UK nogal what a farce "Plus Judge Zondo is very slow and sometimes he needs to be update during the process I have the same feeling @Thembisa Odendaal 
16:40,20:16, WOW. So many executives were appointed through Dudu Myeni. hayi sandiswa nam ndicinga njalo Miss nineth month must not come back. She is always frustrating the chair. She must be kept busy with administration. Can someone help me understand why Dudu Myeni and Yakhe Kwinana aren't arrested yet? Where's Adv Batohi I realized that whenever she's the one standing the chair always take over in terms questioning the witnesses former COO Htlaudi Motswaneng even this one iwill make itinteresting lool "Musa Mabunda I believe implicated persons will have an opportunity to respond at l this commission . I am sure indictments are in the process. kwa dugusa service protests 
20:54,25:17, "@Yolo More eish Plus we want to hear their side of story here before they go to jail. @Thabo Vuma vuma Because she destroy the story or the sense of the information by the manner she ask the questions @Yolo More These guy will never implicate them selves "@Yolo More we will hear their side of story in court. This whole evidence will have to play it out over again in a court of law still @thabo vuma no she was told at the legotla to be the acting CEO makes me sick @Thabo Vuma So she had to keep aside "Yes and we have to pay 9% more for electricity "Musa Mabunda üòÇüòÇüòÇ 
25:33,31:00, we all going to pay for the looting guys I want to know what about Coleman Andrews who sold all Sara's assets then given over 200million golden handshake does nothing happen to him before he became CEO he bankrupted a few airlines "musa mabunda @Owen yes but the same witnesses will still have to give same evidence in court Remember the NPA will also do its own investigation and they will merely confirm the commission investigators' hi im just in but id like to ask what hapens to the money gone . will it be returned and made to be returned with people being held to account The commission should enlist the services of Adv Adila Hassim to work with Adv Hofmeyr. She's equally ferocious and extremely competent money gone and blown..most likely in overseas havens..no chance of getting it back.best punishment is jail sentence.. üîÆüîÆCan you see into the minds of NPA ? 
31:09,33:15, Adv. Dirk Groenewald can also do a great job State Capture is only an Enquiry not an Investigation. Judge Zondo will compile his report and recommendations as to the implicated parties. It will be up to The NPA to take this further. is there no sales and made to pay back system but npa should act immediately..based on zondo comm @Musa Mabunda Adv Hassim handled quite a few sessions in 2018 and she was ferocious life sentence is solution "Emirates fly 4 times a day to Johannesburg + Durban Cape Town "Zondo himself told law enforcement not to wait for the commission Get Gerrie 
33:21,35:21, life sentence traded against return of moneys..then reduced sentence Adv Hassim is ferocious Maggie How the likes of Myeni can pull the race card at the most inappropiate time. This is the reality of state capture....... Yip racist. BEE is racist against a minority. ancyl and all anc structures interested in positions of power so they can loot "BEE is meant to redress the imbalances of the past only zulus? BEE is unlawful because it is racist and biased against the minority of whites. 
35:51,39:36, How is it unlawful? You can argue it is unfair but not unlawful no ..dont bring zulu in picture..across the board in s africa..just that the looting is related to demographics.so if done in eastern cape..the xhosa etc No where in the world do you have BEE and transformation against a minority group based on their skin colour. @Musa Mabunda With a large percentage going into Gupta and pals pockets magashule not xulu..he biggest culprit @Born free unfortunately apartheid benefited only whites and to correct that we have to apply the opposite hence the BEE yip @Musa Mabunda Apartheid ver 2.0 no money my family not keep other family my fmiy not other cantre not other state 
39:44,42:26, @cassim suleman So now it's revenge? I don't think Dudu Myeni is right upstairs. She is a nyaopist. systematic desstruction of the fabric of a black.. She was power high and drunk @cassim suleman And now we have systematic oppression of whites. How is that right? @Born free ..... Namibia recently kicked BEE to touch because it was not working and was deemed to be a racist practice "@Derek no not revenge..but have to address the injustices of apartheid..cant do nothing and ignore how the black nation was destroyed. @Musa Mabunda I think we would have been a lot further along that road if the cadres didn't steal all the money. Whites are being made scapegoat's for the ANC failures. 
42:43,44:48, Anyone that disrupts the previlege of minority is Corrupt thats the narrative and thats what we shouldnt be fighting if we had the land Musa my point of view is not to take revenge that is self destructive this is what is currently happening what the previous goverment did is now practiced by current government @cassim suleman Like I said Apartheid ver 2.0 what is happening from black population is as a result of ANC not addressing the imbalance properly..they looted insteaf BEE Is a Racist nonsensical system. It has destroyed all African countries. This is not practised in Botswana.. a merit system works. ya unfortunately we minority is getting the backlash of poor ANC @Francel van Eeden is it necessary to redress the past imbalances? @cassim suleman Are you excusing their criminality? @Musa Mabunda By perpetuating apartheid??? 
44:59,47:01, "@Cassim Suleman no ways..but cause and action..is where we are.. Musa I do agree with you there 200% no question but how we adress it is the question gees this goes soo to the ground I hope they can rubbish out from management to the floor workers @Francel van Eeden okay what would you suggest? Borrowed Money and taxpayers money has been STOLEN the ANC did not embrace minorities into the structures..we have become isolated and marginalised.. "@Derek Main how can we go about it then morning twane 
47:05,48:16, no Miss Hofmeyer today this lady does not inspire any confidence that is why Chair has to get involved Instead of focusing on the current and previous injustices as our goal post lets stand together and build a future We will fight the ANC in a Constitutional Court. Am I the only one who is fed up by these hackers that keep on poping tough to solve now..body is rotten.and worse to follow.. "@Yolo More Same here @Musa w is unfair discrimination based on race. Isnabunda What we have no "Me too let the injustices be our warning light what not to do and what to prevent 
48:34,50:07, What we have now is unfair discrimination based on race. Isn't that what apartheid was? true yip mandela warned against black domination over white. Yes Derrick. but how else do we fix injustices of the past? Cry Out Beloved Country "Siyabonga Dladla @Thulani Bukani Read my previous comment RE poor benefitting click on three little dots and report and block 
50:30,52:54, "Thando Nkutha "@yolo if we as minority are suffering think of poor masses..they suffering worse.poor education..no facilities..transport.wats their future we focuss so much on politics which angers all off uss. Remember we put the power in their hands lets take our power and use it for the benifet of our country not a political party cant do that..very difficult much learning ahead. im going back to work "Margareth Waterboer No Investor confidence = No jobs "Very tiring 
53:14,1:00:04, we must stop waiting for politicians to solve the problems we must take responcibility and start solving it ourselves but cant happen if we keep on pointing fingers This government won't dictate to me who I employ üò∏üò∏@Thando ancyl is a dumb structure "@cassim suleman Exactly my point i agree ..but against bee..i think state should be the bee partner..as the money can be spent for benefit the country "@cassim suleman What you are saying (and what is currently being done) is : ""We are going to fix the effects of discrimination by further discrimination"". Don't you see how bizarre that is?" The Doctor from Friday must come back and finish his wrap up that was cut dudu myeni gets the award 
1:00:08,1:02:56, Dudu myeni was very arrogant IS very arrogant bee only benefitting elite. @Yose Human white people have no appetite to fight inequality @Thulani Bukani Of course there is but it's not a quick fix solution. They should be encouraged and mentored to gain the necessary knowledge and experience to sit on the board. "That's why I do not take serious all the RET revolutionaries. If you follow them closely @Thulani Bukani Just putting unqualified persons in positions they cannot meaningfully contribute to will just collapse the company. How does tha help anyone? "@Thando Nkutha yes I have noticed that transformation has been abused for wrong reason BEE in SOE's is managed by criminal government employees at the highest order. 
1:04:08,1:06:58, "@Derrick Who wants to employ Zulus.. they are idle. I am very disappointed by the people who will always compare potatoes to carrots escapes from process and policy to be followed "Chief justice is doing this advocates job can anyone please deal with this annoying Arab person keeps annoying us here with Arabic text and adds? Nepotism and Corruption qualifies you a job in government sectors. @Thulani Bukani Exactly - they just want the benefits without contributing to the well-being of the company. "@Born free yes super relaxed 
1:07:30,1:10:22, @Thulani Bukani My concern is not really for the fat cats wanting to be on boards - my concern is for the vast majority of our people living in abject poverty. BBBEE was meant to solve that problem. "@Thulani Bukani But the greedy cadres want it all. They don't care a jot for the poor. As far as they're concerned @Derek Main Porsche's and Rolex's don't trick-down to the poor *trickle down "@Thando Nkutha Only 14 days to go...... Getting lots of popcorn for those 4 days..... the demise of.... JZ.... let Kate Hoffmeyer loose on him What time is it in S Africa? BEE has not solved poverty because of government looting and mismanagement of funds.. which was meant to assist poverty issues. 11.16 am
