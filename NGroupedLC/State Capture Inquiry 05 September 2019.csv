8:20,13:43, hallow everyone hi Maggie gud morning everybody she is very educated and very relevant the field of tv and radio Miss Pelay have so many diplomas "Ifundile le nzwakazi. Morning curry Brilliance..... Hlaudi was incharge isintu no following of policies abeyinduna. 
14:45,25:05, yes pls refer to him as Mr motsoeneng Hlaudi was leadership 🙂 Hlaudi was the SABC. 😂😂😂😂 "😂 funny  and the police must change and do their job very clean "hlaudi must be charged Hlaudi is not grade 9.. the ancestors gave me degrees. stop saying he's grade 9. 😂😂😂 😂 😂 😂 grade 9😂😂 
25:09,27:09, Hlaudi attended Gupta university . @Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona You are right. Standard 9. Any difference? hey gys welcome @Gee Peex1 Is the N6 the name of a Freeway like the N1 or N2. He evntually did hit the Highway.hahahahaha Hi ppl of SA @ Gee Peex1 she is not scared of Hlaudi heyy lol N6 freeway😂 
27:47,33:36, nokxy @Gee Peex1 The man did not even pass matric. It is contained in the PP report. Where did he get an N6 from? Hlaudi is not right in the head. "hayi stop saying Hlaudi is not right in the head... he is a leader of a political party now "@Derek Main you are correct he was angry when he got 2 votes. he said 'I voted for Hlaudi and Hlaudi voted for Hlaudi.' 😂😂😂 @Gee Peex1 But you stated it as a fact. Now support it. Where did he get a N6 from? @Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona 🤣 Sounds about right for Hlaudi. The female kidnapper of Amy-Lee was known to parents. This will add to the unemployment of domestics that is for sure. Glad to say kidnapping is a life sentence. 
34:37,39:23, @Lorna Kavanagh Is it a fact the Domestic was arrested? or involved? hi gys Pastor J she was arrested hope they talking about this human trafficking and this xenophobia going on we are not safe and this government is quite don't know what are they waiting for we are tired SA is no longer a country @Lorna Kavanagh Terrible It's a part of the vile abuse suffered by women in children in this broken country @Lorna Kavanagh Yoh thats bad. But the news channels have not indentified anyone yet.Where did you see that part of it?Just interested @Cerebis A very broken and sad country indeed mt friend "@Derek Main paraphrase 
39:43,48:42, always a suspect😃😃 "@Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona The 'two' voters who voted for Hlaudi are certainly not right in the head EWN news said a female suspect has been arrested @Lorna Kavanagh Could it possibly be the childs Grandmother or Aunt? "@Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona How did Hlaudi arrive at 90% @Lorna Kavanagh Why so??? Thats a sign of BACKWARDNESS. "Norman Zwane 12h00 EFF presser 
49:06,52:52, @Mkabayi kaSenzangakhona So the guys who were celebrating were celebrating the @African Refugee Blacc being a colour maybe? hello everyone here @African Refugee Black yes Blacc no Not interested in the EFF presser! They are part of the problem in SA. fellow south african let us unite and fight those who looted our soes the way we fight immigrants If Hlaudi came to this commission he would break the internet. "African refugee "@Jacob Zuma ...darker the chocolate 
53:04,57:36, yes let him we need him we need some comedy @Slindile Ngcobo True True. Just had a dark chocolate. Very tasty. "@Diggo  "Diggo Hopefully the On Point issue will now also be properly investigated as well as the shooting of a firearm at an EFF meeting by the Great Pretender.? "MR ZUMA cut it. nobody wants to hear. see @Cerebis Exactly - who needs to watch Malema vomit his racism. "who ever you are masquerading to be @JacobZuma  True tell him 
57:37,1:01:31, just block him @Paular Sated Use the block facility and save yourself some frustration. for as long as the government doesnt do anything about immigration of foreign natoinal who are not supposed to be here only the legitimate ones should remain in this country the rest must go Da day they stopped showing violence on TV is the day i stopped paying TV licence South Africans are known to be lazy without foreingners without Development in S Africa you like soft life only @rwantsana ps I agree - it's an issue that has to be addressed. The Dept of Home Affairs has a lot to answer for. Motsoaneng was controlled by Zuma and Guptas Jacob Zuma...What's up player..Can u lend one million I'll pay u back 
1:03:24,1:06:30, "I have blocked @Jacob Zuma "this is boring ..follow it !! matata Free state 😳😳😳 "tell u what! this is banana Republic "South africa government is the one who let down their citizens Eish free state and its' judiciary. Hayi maan. "@Hlamulo Evan Correct! There is no coherent immigration policy or it's not being implemented properly. Like so much else the ANC touches 
1:06:54,1:10:15, @Gee Peex1 How did your N6 research go? Should we resolve to change it to N0? "Painting heist Anc is controlled by foriengers it seems..Prostitutes are running this country "@Gee Peex1 That was your ""get out card"" 3 weeks ago as well. If that is true just paste it again. hahahahaha" Moshoeu u had delayed to block Zuma ok @Gee Peex1 Nobody asking for it to be stopped - we need some of the skills that immigrants bring. But the uncontrolled movement of foreigners into SA will cause more strife. It's not rocket science. "every single person that uses YouTube and Facebook daily are funding peadophiles in government 0.00333% That is percentage of the country's population watching online!!! 
1:11:26,1:15:57, @6.913.09 sixthousandninehundredandnine Quite ironic that you are raising this issue ON YOUTUBE!! SA is a gansters paradise @Kopz Koape. Let us come out with solutions. talk is cheap and is outdated. it can be stopped once we oust corruption @Gee Peex1 This must an issue that governments around the world are grappling with. Our government needs to do a better job. they can if they choose to the European union bounds their hands and even despite this italy greece and various other countries are now refusing "it's time that people started to show themself as worthy and i dont blame them controlled immigration is what is desirable but our problem is pure unadulterated corruption 
1:16:09,1:20:09, his hands are bound friend wake up! @Gee Peex1 Ah so there is a way to control it. Our looters were busy taking bribes instead of thinking of a way introduce humane win-win controls. Few foreigners are without access to all SA grants. no our border patrol agents and police take bribes @Norman Zwane The grants system seems to be a hot-bed of fraud and corruption. we have problems with Nigerian cartels and all sorts due to this corruption and i have no doubt they are in with government as corruption drips down from the top the only solution is to stop and prosecute corruption at the highest levels @Gee Peex1 .” A human resources manager at the SABC in 1996 told Motsoeneng that the fact that he did not have a matric certificate would be a serious hindrance to progress in the SABC. and the fear of being corrupt will drip down from the top 
1:20:45,1:23:55, "@Gee Peex1 This was after an audit by Deloitte & ­Touche had found his colleagues regarded him as a “semi-literate journalist No we can properly enforce our borders and then check peoples credentials when they enter our country "@Shaun 21 People indeed under-estimate how corruption can morph out of money to Xenophobia @Gee Peex1 The point is simple. You made a point that he has a N6 as a fact and cannot support it. Be real bro. agreed thats our goal as people rather then focusing on the symtoms which the government loves we should focus on the source of the problem which is government Well said @Norman Zwane @Pastor J I read on news24 the female suspect is a teacher at the little girl's school. our government love pointing fingers and detouring discontent @Lorna Kavanagh Read the post from @JS Bach .Is this a Domestic or Black persons you were referring to? 
1:24:08,1:31:18, "@Derek Main It is @JS Bach Thanks for that update. Very sad indeed that we cant trust those that we need to trust @Gee Peex1 You may consider me to blind but I dont bulls88t people that I am highly intelligent if i am not.Try being honest friend. @Norman Zwane That's the same modus operandi of the gangsters here in CT. "@Pastor J Talking of TRUST @Gee Peex1 @Pastor J I'm with Pastor here - you made a claim and he called you out on it. Now you can't substantiate your claim. @Gee Peex1 Yes - I am. "@Derek Main In the past @Gee Peex1 🤣 Sorry bro. I'm sure it won't be our last run-in but it's nice to hear different viewpoints. 
1:32:37,1:48:00, @Norman Zwane Agreed - which is sad - there are many people in SA living in abject poverty. That grant is their lifeline. This woman knows what she's talking about @Thando Nkutha It does seem odd that they are not paid for their work. @Gee Peex1 Thought they would have put him in a padded room by now. @Norman Zwane You are right my brother. Even some Pastors are doubtful these days @Derek Main . Thank you Derek. You are always straight and honest on all the chats. It irks me when people continuously state innuendos as a fact and cat support it when asked to do so. just give 👤 an answer . @Gee Peex1 .....He is a Chairman not a Judge for this particular commission 
1:49:03,1:55:29, "The judge can comment @Gee Peex1.... lol I have never had the pleasure of meeting Mr Main. I am from KZN. You can't like her but you can appreciate her performance. it seems to me the judge is more strict on keeping with the comissions mandate and not want to listen to a lot of inuendos "No Biased? Please substantiate...how is she biased? @mafuta Maybe one day. I went to school in PMB YEARS ago. @Thando Nkutha if you go of on the already dead race card i will block you please lets keep this clean @Derek Main haha...... maybe we met and we didn't even know it 😂 
1:56:10,2:00:27, @mafuta Stranger things have happened. the white Hofmeyer why the white and just not advocat hofmeyer Now now Thando and Danie... Play nice!! apolgise for what no she is a person and advocate then keep racial crap out of this then i apologise keep your part to plz Zondo is very perplexed i do to in an profesional way as there are a few others to but on the flip side some reale new ones only way to learn is on the job 
2:00:36,2:04:23, @Thando Nkutha atleast this one is better than Ms Norman. She is calm unlike Ms Norman. hey Gee Peex1 "My fellow south africans The ANC is governing as it were a One Party State. Chiss Joe ​ running of the state and we are just watching? Where in the world has this happened. .. Try Russia!!!. it did not just happened it was planned and engineered in advance with leadership at the top Blindly respect ... the big problem! "So JZ would will arrive late ^being asked questions. 
2:04:38,2:06:44, "@Chiss Joe. A better explanation is ignorance. That's why all other nations are occupying space with businesses inside the beast was walking big fat lions and eating the country lean from a lot of angles "Not at all Gee Peex1 - respect is amazing It is wrong for BLF to have more coverage than the PAC. Hyhenas time for lunch - I am going to look for the gravy train wish me luck 3G while the world just finish from 4G and now going to 5G at one stage when bosassa broke it was more like a pack of wild dogs ripping this country apart 
2:07:04,2:09:31, She is talking about the past 2016 is not long ago @Huntley Cronje. Gravy train lost some wheels. be careful there might be some snippets left unless the hyenas was there first 1st &2nd world were still on at least 4G 3 years is a long time in tech. Is this Adv. Molefe sister? dont tell me that 4G was not posible in 2016 i lived in France in these years and as individual i had 4G 
2:09:53,2:13:17, Now we know why farm murders and assaults are not reported on. i do not want enter into politicks and religeon here but xenophobia needs to be adressed in both areas we need tollarance and also uhold the law uphold @x. .x Where are you bro? It is the scavengers and wonga thugs that are using Xenophobia as an excuse to steal and loot. "@Danie Nilsen @x. .x lol had some beef bunnychow for ssupper and just now wiped the last @x. .x Lots of nice places in Durbs bro Hi Pastor J.. where do you have your sermons? 
2:13:19,2:17:38, @Rob Nel i realy do not know if it can be called that or if it is an organized exersise by some entity Julius Malema @Born free I am now retired but I still Mentor and teach new Pastors into Ministry 😉👍 SABC should serve us not any party. It's a public broadcaster financed by tax payers money. "@Gee Peex1  "The thieves "When listening to this damning testimony i must add that you can not excuse yourself from it though it was pay for work or do not get work ie contracts 
2:17:49,2:21:37, Fraud in the private sector is bad but worse of is when the state steals money from it's citizens. "funicanz ​@Gee Peex1  true In fact she'd been shot in the face using a pellet gun sometime before she died. "I get that why u people doing that killing Zambia's people? "Why take somebody to the three Gupta brothers to be congratulated? Is that normal in a country with UCT very true "we are on the same page. I was merely responding to @Gee Peex1 who wants me provide proof of my statement which I did. Hlaudi was corrupt and he knew he was protected 
2:21:43,2:24:31, sometimes da truth can heal u hi hi no it is an cancerous way of making or atempting to capture the person same sa an spiders web munc curry at saxon world is like working as a hitman woman hitman for the mafia hi sure n that's why u ar doing that ola da so called motsoeneng handicapped material just do as they wish Why can’t zondo create a ways to come forward unanimously? 
2:24:33,2:27:49, "Guys India India via Dubai @Gee Peex1 Despite everything you are still loved by me. I have to remind you everyday but how stupid are we maraaaaa😱😱 "Its not about rich ppl "Yes Guptas only became wealthy when they captured Zuma and the ANC i a can understand poor unemployed stealing to food on the table what i do not get is goverment who is not poor and have employement steal from the poor 
2:28:03,2:32:09, DCJ likes the word “JOB”! @Thando Nkutha You are and will always be the first man I loved despite being married to my wife for 40years. But Zuma was president of South Africa how could it be that we were auctioned off. So the Gupta brothers paid off the corrupt guys from our own money...now that is hilarious. I am confused @Thando Nkutha You are a fine and honest man with a lot of integrity. I do respect you a lot my brother Not condoning xenophobia but makes one wonder whether or not the foreigners are seeking a better like in RSA than what they have in their own home countries. Speaks volumes. @Chiss Joe. School counts. let the love flow thats all that we need let the love flow I'm also confused how a person can break into your house and than start feeding you from your own pots and you start worshipping the thief. 
2:32:10,2:35:13, "@Thando Nkutha  @Danie Nilsen You are also loved Danie @funicanz We are sharing love in a sad and cruel world. You are also loved "One day Guptas and Watson amongst others captured Zuma and as a result the State was captured in turn by these people and Zumas ANC faction. SA needs to free itself from the ANC in order to really be free @Chiss Joe..that's so true so much in that one sentance and yet so easy to follow i will not do any bad unto others that i do not wish upon myself I don't like my neighbor he is a wolf in sheep's clothing 
2:35:55,2:39:42, "Diss & Dad They are corrupt to the core Gee Peex ..I hope you are being sarcastic. @Thando Nkutha I will and likewise my Precious friend "Look at Thabo Mbeki Hope that you are?? Where have you been hiding the past 20 odd years ? "@Moshoeu Mabusela - finished my little bit of leftovers from last night Mbeki was no saint. The money is offshore. If you cannot put away money for retirement on a President's Salary - then you ought not to be there in the first place. "Did people join the struggle to come and steal? I don't know 
2:40:28,2:42:46, Only Struggle is to hide the corruption haha @Huntley Cronje We suckers that are taxpayers pay for ex-presidents and their families for the rest of their lives. "Derek - you also paying for the Watsons "@Born free...get it back. If you can't @Gee Peex1 Zuma definitely perfected corruption on a grand scale. How could he have been a giant? That is a peddled narrative. Have you any literature about him being a giant? during the struggle zuma ran a detention camp for unruly members of the struggle where some questionable things happened to say the least Forced to resign so that they could loot. 
2:43:08,2:47:08, @Antonie Goosen Of course - I am paying for all the cadres feeding at the trough. I hope we are not going to witness another accident "@Gee Peex1 You'd have to be blind @Chiss Joe..exactly @Gee Peex1 Just because she didn't find evidence in one particular case that she investigated doesn't mean he's innocent. His time is coming. Qunu? even my grandmothers house she build from the money she saved from selling umqhoboti is better. Mandela used his own money to build Qunu. anyone of us caught doing such a thing would be in prison Why was Zuma allowed to have all those wives and kids on the payroll 
2:48:40,2:53:23, ZUMA IS NOT A VICTIM of anything. He's just a corrupt leader. "I miss the real ANC of Mandela "@Gee Peex1 - what Rich country poor leadership "Isn't South Africa richer than the Emirates In terms of minerals "@Diss & Dad Like I say @Danie Nilsen The thingy was with Dali Mpofu. Zuma was behind the killing of Chris Hani and the ANC knows that it was not declared a crime against humanity awe ouens
