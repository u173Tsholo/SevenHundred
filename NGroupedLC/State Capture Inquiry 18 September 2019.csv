15:26,19:22, Is there anybody not taking advantage ie thieving from state funds? You and I for starters @clive oconnell .hahahahaha wh0 is this Pastor We‚Äôre not ANC appointees @hlengani khuvutlu Roelofse. He did some of the investigations into Mdluli. @clive oconnell . True but even if I was I am certain and sure I will still be driving my 20year old Jalopy. üòÄüòÄbut given the opportunity... @ Clive oconnell.. a piggy bank? is that a slur on Roleofse's apperance? this guy.know.what.he.is.talking.aboutno.corners 
19:48,25:02, @Sanjay Maharaj ....Naughteeeeee boy. @JS thanks This rough cop resembles PW Bothaü§í I want to see this Col. Naidoo. I want to know who he naid ü§£ü§£ü§£ Wow I respect Mr Roelefse he must take these crooks down. still has to find its way to courts The Rot of Africa maybe south africa will be clean 
26:04,28:34, "nah. it starts with us on the ground. if we do not get ourselves literate "@ Yes if we all stop pointing fingers at each other and start working together we can clean up and lock up the crooks and build a great SA. when.after.the.commision.i.daubt. Micheal well said Let‚Äôs wait and see @Lawrence Matshoane. 2020 is the year of Prosecutions. So wonderful to have a well spoken witness and not sound familiar like eeeee eeeeh eeee "if every citizen took to the streets in an orderly manner and simply said to the NPA that they must move on these investigations and bring them to a head by March 2020 "These corrupt Crime Intelligence people were so busy stealing money that we had no ""Intelligence""....only ""Crime"" taking over all of our lives." 
29:11,31:44, ü§£ s'tru that waste of time üôÑ Afriforum will see to it that the NPA do their job. THE CURSE OF AFRICA IS ITS RICHES IN MINERALS WHICH CREATED CORRUPTION THROUGHOUT AFRICA I agree @Born free. That‚Äôs why we shouldn‚Äôt despair. @Sindiswa Moolman ....And so they said. Something needs to happen soon. Confidence amongst the population will bring great benefits. the curse of Africa is its people that allows themselves to be pulled to the sway of corrupt leaders. They put petty tribalism and superstition above principle. Minerals have nothing to do with these crooks in Crime Intelligence "Agreed @Pastor J. As @Born free said 
32:37,35:43, wz mdluli getting paid?? "you know Afri forum and the way they work is exactly why that Nats is.it.the.mdluli.we.know.or.someone.else "I will also at some stage soon see a similar Inquiry and or approach with some Churches and Pastors who are fleecing mostly the poor. Any Pastors on the chat that share this view. If not "@Born free‚Äã WHO IS THIS PRETTY LADY what? the big white oke is a lady? I see @Pastor J know what he‚Äôs talking about about pastors cele 
36:06,37:13, bheki cele yes "pastor John WHAT IS HER CHRISTIAN NAME @Sindiswa Moolman .... I absolutely do and I respect a lot of the negative sentiments expressed so often. It certainly has substance. verushka "@skeetpetegibbs Should have been Adv Zwane @Sanjay Maharaj I fully agree Nobody‚Äôs ever become an ANC Freedom Fighter to stay poor. @skeetpetegibbs Ms Jamnandas September 
37:36,40:26, @skeetpetegibbs Is she a Christian? verushka September. he coloured father came for the curry and stayed for a bonk Zuma once told us that he didn‚Äôt fight for freedom to be poor @clive oconnell. So I tend to agree with that statement. hahahhahahahaha @Sanjay Maharaj @clive oconnell @Sindiswa Moolman . I certainly did. I the went into Ministry and retired even more poor. Hahahahahahaha but true. @Sindiswa Moolman Nomvula Mokonyane was one of those who did not fight to be poor. then Zuma couldn‚Äôt have that size family without many large donations from friends? ü§£ü§£ God's work done and done well 
40:44,44:24, Zuma is in big financial trouble and he will know what it is like to be poor again because of his lack of leadership and governance. @Sanjay Maharaj That should and is the ideal approach but sadly does not happen in practice most of the time Clive you clearly have not been to rural kzn. okes there have full villages of wives and children without a cent Sanral must be next Like Mandela family all so poor. They must stop breeding born free who? "@Born free Hey futsek wena then you mean embrace family planning. not stop breeding. who will play soccer for ZA if that happened? 
44:37,48:59, HELLO COMMBRADES!!!!!!!! wazzup! " Cele were are u?? Zuma how will you support your family when your home is liquidated and sold? actually not. no procreation is no procreation. family planning is responsible procreation Only intelligent Blacks practice family planning @moses nothing doin boss. fasting. Time of our ancestors @moses my China it is not our breeding rates. it is us dying young from too much curry 
49:02,51:23, "imagine Everyone must practice family planning.. children cost money and you must ensure they have an equal opportunity in life to be educated and upstanding citizens you mean like Henri van breda? Sanjay maharaj your remark about her father is offensive. Ms September is a respected advocate and her family is none of your business ! or that minownoke offensive to her or you? "eish we need decolonised educationses because knowledge is apparently subjective "@Sanjay Maharaj‚Äã stop xenophobia please 
51:25,53:29, Henri chose to take drugs either wya it was said in Hest and not meant as a slur. so go play in traffic for all I care @paul. me too...

I am proudly Rhodesian "Mbuso Ndlovu do not make accusations of things that u don't have proof for Those people that wrote the Bible were closet gays 
1:07:40,1:10:28, @Moses Sandile and you and Trump are both bigots and fucken idiots. Jesus only had 12 men friends üë¨ They hid behind their own scriptures just like the Popes and Cardinals do. Where was Jesus' girlfriends? Jesus could have been Gay @Born free ....exactly..... Zuma.. some are born to be gay in your country I am a spiritualist 
1:10:29,1:12:27, I will not be drawn into what many see as controversial. Times have changed and the views of the Church should as well to a large extent. I think Jesus was gay @Born free mohammed was gay not jesus..... @Moses Sandile...... so how many kids did he have then?

Go and find another forum to discuss your beliefs. OR Shut up! Moses üí°off Ya boet No religion advances homosexuality. It is a Societal issue and a matter of personal choice. Scriptures was intended to be a guide to how we live but has also taught us tolerance and acceptance. 
1:21:48,1:27:53, SoWhat about the lesbianism @Moses Sandile;...Thou shall not kill. I prefer lesbians in full HD mostly ü§£ @Moses Sandile . The Church has many facets and Leaders with differing view points.
