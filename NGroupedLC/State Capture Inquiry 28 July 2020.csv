So when he presented the firepool expination there was a song playing reminder this is the guy who brought up the Berlin Conference yesterday... anyway the firepool song continues thus... "Ma il mio mistero √® chiuso in meIl nome mio nessun sapr√†No "No Sleep "the previous comment is the translation of the firepool song ANC now has got themselves a R70 billion loan from IMF so it's now party time!

15:41,22:34, "Now "then very wild arm descriptions CR's spokesperson is married to one of our 14 kings and queens who take R500 million per year from our taxes. He is the sole director of the company which got a R120 million tender to supply PPEs. finger on mouth - still lying The gravy train is running smoothly. whole hand on the mouth - visa a vie a lie Corruption train has left Zondo miles/decades behind. @Dominic gone and derailed if his lips are moving he's lying ü§î 
23:28,35:45, Mike I think it's worse than that... if breath is moving through the vocal chords it turns to lies... this guy can hum a lie There's a difference between government and governance. I'm losing faith in Zondo. This is taking too long. He already has enough information to establish what the basic problem is. I just came in. what agents is he talking about? Hello African people Hello why do they take too long while they know the truth "R500bn gone! plus new IMF R70bn whose the suspect here?I am new okay thanks 70 Billion Rands? 
36:36,39:12, conceptual understanding of interpretaations CR is BEE billionaire courtesy of ANC. It's payback time. Expect to be disappointed if you are not corrupt. Aye JOBURG the navelfluff in my navel is relative to my stomach and the institutions that report to the greater portfolio that rubs against the shirt which nakes up the fluff in my bellybutton We need equal rights and justice for all.Please put those who stole the money in Prison and take back everything they have. that is my understanding of my job Stolen money has already been spent. Nothing left. mrng ppl is this the same guy who tried to convince us that the swimming pool is actually a fire pool during Nkandla matter "Almost 2 years 
39:17,43:34, They must rot in jail "Neesun Dormo yekeli Inkandla wena This people have made South Africa theirs Where are these guys putting this money they are alleged to have stolen? üôÇ I would really them to disclose what they own before any briefing of this sitting... Just to get a vivid view. @Enoch Dipela tnx .... I'm afraid he's gonna start sweating again trying t hide the truth kkkkkkk Im sure wet cement drys quicker than words flow in this hearing @Dominic Przybylski Like every ‚Äúcommission‚Äù ever undertaken... waste of money and people‚Äôs hopes for justice in the country What a wate of tax payer money. 
43:59,47:09, is the man in glasses a suspect? whats the interest rate for this Dollar based IMF loan and whats the payment term? 20 yrs? "yes he's not a suspect but rather an implicated person in wrong doing @chimbuzi1 The government will have to print money to repay the loan and then we will be heading into Zimbabwe style hyper-inflation. I hope so Maphumula Money printer go Brrrrrrrrr Mr. Chair Zondo playing dum...along with this guy hit him with legislation "Alvino 
47:14,49:46, "@Dominic Przybylski yes thats obvious I watched a lovely TED talk this morning...Africa the sleeping Giant that I‚Äôm trying to wake up :socialdist: @chimbuzi1 Not only diluting wealth of citizens who have not safe-guarded their wealth but also make things unaffordable for anyone trying to earn an honest living. I'm liking Mr Hulley. I think this witness's Nkandla fire pool nonsense is going to come back and haunt him . What rubbish is he complaining about the state changes reports ! Money printer go Brrrrr in Yuan And ANC is all willing to sell...like how they shut down protests that was going to happen at China Malls "China is under water right now 
49:49,54:46, @Vincent Kolobe me too sir "I plead with all at this rate it will take another 10yrs he's saying nothing really he's very busy describing how he thought his job worked "@Wilson M be careful he will drive to your house for a fight  "Kumaran wow judge rubbing them witness privates to make sure he is happy in the witness box he's starting to play politics nw 
55:26,56:45, Best Comedy show ever "I wonder if there is highlight video of this "Police were respected nhleko is very arrogant @Daniels very true..your reasoning is rational "the judge just asked him to respond P delux he try to avoid answering the chair is weak to press him @Bradley agrees an absolute big one 
56:57,58:18, Amazing that they can treat state capture with jokes and clearly not taken seriously "oh microphone marhmallow gloves Trying to avoid answering Are any of these cockroaches going to jail ? "@Jackson Van Staden it was only a matter of time before he showed it he puts himself in a spotlight. "the Judge having to explain his response "so many judges on this platform "His body language says it all 
58:33,1:01:18, it appears this will be an interesting session why are they so nice. its sounds like a talk show this is so clever that he is making acomplete idiot of himself such jovial fun What is even funny? Nerves "Nervous laughter This guy learns from the best dt you laughs when you had difficulty answering the question I agree Luois - the flirting is out of control I keep saying this commission is a waste of time.. 
1:01:19,1:04:10, "Zondo is very smart. To enable Nhleko to answer the question he jas beennavoiding There's nothing wrong with them laughing. Kahlen bo nina. We just only need the questions answered. Advocates Hofmeyer and Maleka would have torn him apart "Coy jibs @ bev I understand your point but I would be careful of using apartheid institution as respected I would say feared as more appropriate but with regards to elders and parents absolutely true I think all this above the mask eye movement is very hot right now "@Kumaran "nd he said it would have been better ""apartheid government to rule"" but change the rules" "and he said it would have been better ""apartheid government to rule"" but change the rules" 
1:04:35,1:09:44, Now one is following i see only political comment . as im trying to follow "Clearing throat just like JZ hehehehe. Can't hide his Nerves. If he has done nothing wrong ehm ehm my theory by me... laughter is injected every so now and then... going to start the clock at the next laugh and see the lap times commission funds must be redirected to the poor and Covid pandemic Ehm ehm can‚Äôt recall moron "@dada ngova ""It is disgusting to think that covidpreneurs thought the pandemic was a time for them to enrich themselves get rid off the corrupt officials and give that to poor and covid pandemic. 
1:10:37,1:13:02, "Government officials don't ""give"". They take." #NoLivesMaterToAnyGovernment "@Dominic..off course it is but No wonder ANC government officials plunder and are so corrupt as none of them get jailed or found quilty while the nation tolerate this he is feeling the heat He needs to think of new tricks yaya tea and cakes time hahahaha yes Zuma man comfort break kkkkkk Maybe he needs a change of underwear 
1:13:41,1:19:06, pu$$y @Mohamed Miaü§£ü§£ü§£ they are really deteriorating "Definitely not the ""Brains """ @dada ngova In a communist state the only people who live well are in government and the ruling party. The more government controls the more they take. Unfortunately we have become a communist state. Africa.? "The President should have suspended the Commission you see by the time recommendations (non binding) are issued the victims of corruption would be dead from hunger and Corona virus @Mandla Mngomezulu Better for president to suspend VAT. If government stops taking money from the people it's same as giving to the people but no chance for corrupt officials to get their hands on it. 
1:19:53,1:33:46, Because the majority of and voters are a bunch of cowards .I would not give a party that I voted for a second chance. anc is on change............? bull-dust baffles brains. Bathi Nhleko behaves like a slow learner # questions are clear but he is evasive. Judge Zondo yahaya ngomzaca mr fire pool hehehehe... Yes or no maybe kkkkkk "@Riaan DW I find it entirely fascinating how people would repeatedly vote for people who have made it so obvious that they aren't FOR the people @Nokwanda Ladyfair Mkhize Identity politics 
1:35:59,1:40:16, ...lifes unfair buddy bla bla bla... "Wasn't ""fire pool"" a preconceived idea?" "The lesson here for all to come is - as soon as an uncomfortable question is presented to you @Lebohang Mofokeng - HAHAHAHA your comment is spot on! are those files behind this moron there to make hom look intelligent? @Nokwanda South Africa won't survive these thieves...The next generations is going to hate this generation for not standing up to this communist thugs.... folded arms - keeping people at bay Is Pastor J on line? 
1:40:26,1:42:47, Judge look like a ninja. """I think he must have"" indicates he had no interest in hearing/reading Dramat's representation and probably didn't else he would have remembered something about it." @Melvict Melbourne ninja turtle @Jacqui Baumgardt he's on the ENCA stream. There is a terrible audio/video lag on there though. coz there is no logic "@Dominic Przybylski After so many years with the same party in power He keeps indirectly calling the lawyer stupid Slow learner..... "the screw is starting to turn 
1:43:08,1:45:49, Popcorn is stolen "@Nokwanda Ladyfair Mkhize I think it affects most of us Trying to come across as educated.... This guy uses a lot of words to say nothing. Perhaps one day we will be able to vote based on issues and principles. "It's funny cause this generation says 'we are woke"" haha! Lapho it's so simple to remove corrupt individuals Chief Zondo laying the law down with elegance... giggles are finished. Gave him a false sense of security and he took the bait! Nhleko is making a fine job of rendering himself unemployable! Dominic I am waiting for that time to come 
1:46:15,1:48:20, Which cadre is actually employable? "This is exactly why the world bores me Dominic. Race They'll always be a problem when you try to justify a simple answer Limpompo again yes or no doesn't exist in the government or the cadres in senior positions - like ministers The public is highly anticipaging the appearance of ANC SG Ace Magashule on this commission. This guy has a memory of a pea """The whatever period""" "Power corrupts. The longer a party remains in power the more it is corrupted. That's why no political party should stay in power for more than 3 terms 
1:48:33,1:53:03, No selective memory is the case Uwi ANC SG disaster "If we stood together as a Nation against all this corruption it will end. That's why the anc sowed racial tensions Blah blah blah Enough PLEASE! And eventually he was fired = seems like selecting criminals for senior positions is a requirement for this position @Riaan DW What nation? "these muppets are asking wrong questions..none of them have @Melvict Melbourne this is a commission of inquiry in South Africa. The nation of South Africa. there is no such thing as a Suth African nation. 
1:53:10,1:54:46, @Riaan DW We stood together in #zumamustgo correction: IMF loan is part of the R500bn announced in APRIL did you or didn't you? @Melvict Melbourne what do you call it then? There are 11 nations in South Africa Take the Zulu nation.... they have about 260 tribes within that natonb "And gave the second in charge yoh ANC really have clever people doing stupid stuff in the name of corruption This guy is throwing ZUMA under the bus 
1:54:47,1:56:21, @Melvict Melbourne we all inhabit the same land. That is by definition a nation. So I don't understand how you comprehend words. The Fire Chief has a Zim accent. This should be investigated "You inhabit the land @Dylan Burden @Melvict Melbourne is a tribalist. Melvict is just trying to sound woke. ANC - Another Names for Corruption Changing the meaning of words is cool Every nation has tribes wihin Like CYA defences 
1:56:23,1:58:57, All the people that testified should be checked for amnesia and Alzheimers... there are regular tribal killings in KZN stop faffing around the media got the info before the head of state. who leaked the info.he must answer the question. he is playing dumb when corne "This is not a court case I can only conclude from this guy's evidence that he is and was utterly unsuitable to be a minister!!!!! So the hiring and firing is part of state capture. "@Melusi Sikakane yes "ok Yoh he doesn't want to answer that question. Story time!! 
1:59:00,2:03:38, now his mind is starting t wonder """Not my job"" essentially." @Melvict Melbourne How is IPD he is not..questions are pointless there zondo questions his mate @Melusi Sikakane ? These arrogant ANC elite - think they not accountable and this will go away if they waffle away!! They might seem pointless at the face off it but I've certainly heard this dude contradict himself "they all do 
2:03:45,2:05:28, be fair who is asking the questions? @Melvict Melbourne Did Macbride say that or he was crying for his position questions are failing to cage their witness. No Nathi Nhleki...dont be evasive answer questions "It is standard that SA ministers hire private firms to do their work for them Somewhat Tainted????? "witnesses are not here to be cross examined. please guys the lawyer look like he is bored 
2:05:37,2:07:13, what happened to ƒ∫ife esidimeni corruption @Santjie Ntuli nothing what! the man is cornered he doesn't hear himself he is confused "I drove the bus on N1..why? because its my route this guy is not saying anything at all This must be like watching paint dry for the DCJ and the evidence leader.....it surely is for me! @Dominic private firms will be used from time to time because they independent. The government would be investigating itself - conflictual situation. there you are 
2:07:14,2:09:28, @Lebohang Mofokeng listen to what you want to hear "@Santjie Ntuli Life Esidemi @dada how does a Minister contemplate suspending a senior member of the force and not recall if he considered alternative candidates to fill the position albeit on a temporary basis. @Spot on Tebogo Mohohlo Harley being reprimanded in the open..what do you think the witness is thinking @Bren H Private firms have to do whatever customer wants them to do. They have less requirement for independence than government. there are different institutions in government created to provide oversight. the auditing firms has shown that private firms can be worse than government. wake up Werksmans are the biggest state looters Werkmans have made billions from us 
2:09:38,2:13:30, judge chin mask chinwag @Bekithemba you see you have got to be an expert to understand some issues..i think he handled it well there..or questions were not even directed @Melvict Melbourne There are in every SOE. They are very conflicted bribe the Judge and no justice Like the firepool? @Dada you don't need to be an expert for you to plan for your human resource requirements especially if you are going to suspend a senior member of the force What is the name of the evidence leader please? The audit and legal firms are deeply embedded in corruption and state capture. Mr Hulley Hulley 
2:13:40,2:16:02, """My English is running out""" Thanks okay and his English ran out indeed ü§£ Must be hard thinking what to say not to look so guilty. Are the State's legal department so useless that we need to use private copanies? this gentlemen reminds ne of someone else who speaks too much Competency is something you can‚Äôt even spell Nyathi This guy has taken over the commission of enquiry. 
2:16:16,2:18:32, so true Why don't you pick the pone up and ask? this guy was a minister endorsed to serve this country by the ANC? time dcj takes control other will finish next year he is about to "someone correct me if I'm wrong WASTING TAX PAYERS MONEY :dothefive::dothefive: "He talks like a union guy?....Oh yes he is underestimating everyones intelligence 
2:18:41,2:21:32, @Dominic maybe consider that outsourcing maybe be to their buddies not necessarily because they are competent but because they can enable them to provide a justification this guy is insulting us he talk a if he's addressing Judge Zondo "the one report was signed Evidence leader is allowing too much time to the witness to talk without answering the questions.. Typical politician..... talk a lot and say nothing. A state capture commission to solve ANC internal fights and Judges are used. Now is time for Judges to loot but they loot at the pretense of doing justice. Zondo is a criminal are you sure ???? But Mr Hulley should take charge. Chair already said he wants to get to the meat of the reports. 
2:21:57,2:23:00, melusi doesn't apply his mind. he keeps waffling. probably ANC member "this guy with his English Nhlekok is trying to say that they are going beyond the scope of the investigation so they do not ask him the question. @Melusi Sikakane Corruption is not an internal ANC fight. It is something which is destroying our whole country. Try to expand your perception. this man is breathing nothing... ü§î judge zondo should be in orange overalls. a criminal masquerading as a judge what a shame Keep the masses DOM .Can't possibly talk straight. Just mumble over and over and hope people fall asleep zzzzzzz Does Mr Firepool not realise that he has absolutely zero credibility after his crappy Firepool movie where he publicly and shamelessly lied to the entire country? @Jackson Van Staden what crime did Zondo commit? 
2:23:41,2:26:49, Corruption is not only restricted to politicians. The people who vote for corrupt politicians are themselves corrupt. Tebogo you are May be Melusi is an ANC member his comments does not have add value..... "Jackson is baiting. Ignore with a smile @Dylan Buerden do you have any idea how much he is getting paid for this commission and as a justice of the concourt ? @Jackson Van Staden what crime did Zondo commit please? I write reports and often the report are changed as you get to know more. @Dominic corruption is a tax and diverts resources from the poor and the state but not limited to "@Dominic I also want to know from Melusi what crime did Judge Zondo commit 
2:26:53,2:30:11, Same little throat clearing habit before he lies as Zuma. judges never retire as they are paid for life. hence you always get them used all over as retired judge this or retired judge that. they are on RETIREMENT ON CALL very true Tebogo melusi is empty with facts and specifics. stop wasting your time on him nor his comments But question is why you did not consider the second report? Listen carefully.....clear throat......hehehe minister is lost within his own RECORD OF DECISION. BLAME IT ON SPIES "Yu if this guy was teacher all his learners would not be ""A"" students...." One obscurification after another! 
2:30:41,2:31:52, His throat is going to be raw tonight ü•µ which guy is that Lebohang Asks a question to Nhleko. Responds by saying he's answered the question. That easy. Tell him Hulley .... he thinks the evidence leader is foolish Cost of the commission so far is over R 700 Million the judge removed his mask "@Melusi Sikakane I share your concern gloves is coming off "Funny 
2:32:05,2:34:43, comfort break chair what is going on her guys I just got 1min watching "He asks for clarity Am I missing something? The evidence leader wants to address the reports but Nhleko is saying they are trying to avoid addressing them? Does Nhleko only want to address this in his own time? "guys The questioning is in respect of your actions - not the reports that you didn't produce diverting The evidence leader is asking on behalf of the chair? Just answer the question. The evidence leader knows what he is doing..... Nathi Nhleko wants his way 
2:35:05,2:36:59, Zondo sees through all this. Bravo. @Tebogo Mohohlo Nice concise explanation. Thanks. That's it Judge.....tell him to get off his soapbox the shorter your answers the quicker we move on "This Commission is going nowhere this guy wants to justify his actions by what is contained in the report. but he should explain why prompted him to think there was something untoward about having two reports?? Why say yes or no when you can answer with a thousand words to say nothing and avoid the answer Jokes to lengthen the question. Great strategy. just answer the question. 
2:37:01,2:38:07, what a liar "@Dominic "Do something himself! He doesn't do things himself. Private sector ""does"" things Shades of responses in the format laid down bu Zuma "people who talk to much are ducking He is clearly lying through his teeth. sorry we have Trevor Noah for the jokes "@Dominic Przybylski @Tebogo Mohohlo . My issue is that thieving is rising while we have this commission "Another ANC compulsive liar 
2:39:14,2:42:26, Hello everyone....anything happened this morning worth mentioning or still the same old same ? @Melusi Sikakane Please suggest an alternative within the limitations of our current[pathetic] situation. @Kevin literally no new information. "melusi why cant this man jut Answer "eskom was stopped from retrenchment workers by Minister Pravin. why? that is a business decision which if i was the CEO then "Firepool Nhleko @felough julius are you related to Julius Malema?? yes he is mis leading the evidence leader by not answering the question 
2:42:29,2:45:35, "lead if you want to lead and follow if you want to Chair is not playing today! Cadre deployment and misuse of BEE is primary cause of corruption. Any solution has to tackle both issues. "Can SARS and the Hawks not just investigate this crook's personal finances and o a lifestyle audit "@Dominic Przybylski Our problem is that we dont have opposition parties "the ANC is in charge Melusi. so chair mean business today "we need not vote the ANC out "A vote for the ANC is a vote for poverty for the people 
2:46:11,2:48:34, @Tebogo Mohohlo ANC is pleasing its funders. If you owe me you are my servant. this lawyer for the minister sounds clever. @Melusi Sikakane We are in a very new and immature democracy. It is nothing more than a facade for power guaranteed by racial polarization. I think our democracy is a farce. lol this is tense evidence leader no emotion LOL enough of silly jokes Mr firepool @Tebogo Mohohlo You are right however it might be too late...At the rate of Looting there will be no hope of bouncing back in the next 20 years. hahaha slow learner "Is it just me
