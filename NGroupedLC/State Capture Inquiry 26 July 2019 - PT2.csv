Please call all of them but don't call me My President EFF is fighting all evils has he been sentenced to death yet? eff must go to the commission about vbs RISE AND FALL OF ANC Lorraine Naidoo no the NPA must investigate them. and they will find nothing 
13:23,15:46, "I missed the 1st part @Lorraine Naidoo do they have info on that regard? I dot believe that because. they are involved @Lorraine Naidoo thank you for the EFF baby @Dj Himself no CR is not corrupt @Lorraine Naidoo go to the cops/hawks with your info "update no I saw on the news . @makhosi nobhatyi he is supposedly a billionaire but he used other peoples money to buy presidency 
16:03,18:43, DCJ has announced that the President has asked that his affidavit (which he submitted earlier this month) be released to the press & public. if i did I would do so.but unfortunately I watch goes on on the news Have this guy grown some balls yet or is he just accepting Zupta's lies? if you say so.🤣🤣🤣 @Lorraine Naidoo and shame you believe that PROPAGANDA so this commission is propergander propaganda This is good. it means he is showing that State Capture has happened. now things must move faster to catch the thieves and get back some of the money. Dont mess with Zondo this man give enough time 
18:53,20:09, @Lorraine Naidoo im talking about the news you watch This commission will take 10 years to conclude sharp "Wow who in Parliament has A DR un there name. Thank you DCJ.!!!! Yip!!! @JS Bach "They must come  ndlozi 
20:16,21:16, Can hear the Police they coming for Ace Mbuso correct Yes Zondo The spies will tell us more lies under 'oath' "The commission has lost its direction first call Ace please "They must come all of them @ once not one by one gavin watson as well.. Zondo is so slow 
21:20,22:24, Additional security protection for the judge PLEASE!!! Watson first We must wait for Zuma to name drop and expose entirely Even the police are running away what about Bossasa he can inform whining ANCWL was pulling the strings the tie @Edward Kruger and he’s family @david jacobs 😂😂😂😂 
22:39,23:47, hehehehehe Do not forget Rupert companies too VBS too please DCJ the whole happy lot Yes!! @Tee Makara ​ cause we are unhappy And the Openheimer's illegitimate private airpot must be closed Ndlovo they on Bloomberg and you can check them. they have clean audit for many years and not the same audit done on Stienhoff and SOEs Ramaphosa is not a saint😏 
24:09,26:27, U "what Ramaphosa is saying is  "Come on team I just ❤ ❤ ❤ this man. Zondo is the BEST. where does his name come up on the Enquiry. where did he deal with Guptas. you just trying to divert attention. "We want nothing from Zuma "Michael Wild "I've got all my computers on. Johnny Clegg on one side and corruption on another one. Never been so confused... do I cry I am sure by the end of today Ramaphosa is gonna be on the spy list. 
26:30,28:56, @Tee Makara yes correct @Bedazzled lol this 1 I need to listen attentively. TRUMP 2020 "These people lies under oath "Whatever Zuma is going to say it’s all lies Please we got this republicans! 2020 "@Makhosi Nobhatyi yes the mic will not pick up the nod 
29:12,30:47, "He mic will not pick up the nod I love her @Buyiswa Mnyani Silent WAR with itself..... "They must change the mic Already not sure where he signed the documents. Wait and here more lies lol They should have given this commission some prosecution powers "@Khaya Nomoyi what you’re saying might be true or false. Ramaphosa is not a saint buffering sucks. cant wait for 5G 
31:01,35:41, DJ never No one from the Zuma fraction will admit to anything.! 😂😂😂😂 I am all the well with Zuma ubaba Denial and acting like victims All those who tell incriminating truths about others will be assassinated before this transitions towards the courts for prosecution Yess joke is that thing in yr When can we expect any arrests and charges? 
36:20,39:24, "Bloody joke ANC can run fast as they can but they will not hide... Corrupted as they are their deeds will come to light. People are talking arrests - but what about recovery of misused and looted funds "Haaibo @Africa Azania @Goat  Block 🐐 @ DJ Himself I’m always interested on recovering the money more then arrests Am I watching a chinese kungfu movie where the audio is in frond and visuals delayed? @ Goat 😂😂😂😂 lets admit as South Africans the Gupta family z smarter and 20 step ahead... till today they chopping.. while our SOEs n bailout .... 
40:02,42:45, TOLERANCE I remain unshakable that our president is supporting this commission he has nothing to do with state capture keep the chat clean and focus on the subject. non racial comments. use respect @ makhosi nobhatyi I agree @Goat the captured promised honesty but then stole - the colonizers never lied their intentions were always clear This is educational if you care to listen. they made there own to suffer Goat was in Johnny Clegg's chat. block him I think this guy is not gonna expose anybody - he's just here for publicity - trying to get famous 
43:04,46:17, What use is a commission if the result is not arresting and prosecuting those implicated? We already all know these guys are thieving and pilfering everything they can from citizens/taxpayers. Aa hle Dj @ DJ Himself agree Land 😂😂 ANC 🙈🙉🙊💰 goat dont act like one Every word the DCJ utters feels like it weighs 100kg. Alecander the comm is also about the future being of the state not only about arrests but yes it will be done Like I already said further up goat... lock them up. If they are guilty then arrest and prosecute. Your whataboutism is unwarranted here. 
46:51,48:39, @Amanda Watson DCJ should take over the role of Mufasa from James Earl Jones. hey we are carrying u Goat please be respectful James Earl Jones *wipes sweat from forehead* Yes block Yin some people still ask what state capture is people like Zuma who is on the stand today tee dont worry about hime he reminds me of BILLY "@Thando Nkutha hold your mouse over his word

1:00:29,1:02:34, "Is this state capture the commission is there to establish the truth thanks white africa .. the same goes for me and thousands of south african indians @TheC4RB1N3 i get you lol Malema would shake things up here in this boring room.

I would say live by the principle of not hurting anyone 
1:07:52,1:09:39, Ramaphosa only wants to distribute state-owned land only which is just too little. he intends to let caucasians remain with the large portion of land in their ownership Order honourable members what was the offensive statement ah they still capturing at this time on a Friyay!!!! your Rama himself said that "@Mrs Anderson Hahaha it is sad that you suddenly want to be likea boss @Mrs Anderson May you check the hansard madam speaker and make a ruling then when u say things that nopenly insult other race groups it is not offensive

1:12:26,1:14:05, "@neo makhurupetji That is Former Director in the National Treasury @makhosi nobhatyi the PP does not do much investigating if you ask. there are investigators hired - the PP just peruses and finalizes findings and makes remedial actions if there is evidence of wrong @Michael Wild Why only Goat who is black and NOT Kercy. Unfortunate and sad some people has ways with words @Thando Nkutha for going with people who was sars employees to treasury thanks @Sock you are most welcome. Enjoy the show. I have send the warning any more bad comments and he is gone. I timed out Goat and he came back and continued. "@Carnoth ngomane yes same person

Is she investigated me (an unknown) repeatedly on various issues - no one would know "@ carnoth ngomane she is clear now who is she working for 
1:18:34,1:21:26, "@Goat - you were raising pertinent issues 😂😂😂😂😃😃@carnoth ngomane @Goat the Mandelas and Ramaphosas and Motsepes got financially rewarded for that 'forgiveness' - hence they became millionaires. they sold us out and got Chris Hani assassinated. @Sock Yes. This is the State Capture Inquiry I have blocked people from all walks of life. Honorable Comrade Cele. You are bodering on contempt of court. Please contain yourself. Love this witness. Sharp. Not to be taken for a ride. I never ever said I was clever wena. all want is a clean good chat without insulting and racial comments. talk about what this gentleman is talking about. We must all mobilize as South Africa to defend these people who fight for corruption and state capture such as Gordhan otherwise these thugs we will wake up see themselves back to the helms 
1:22:22,1:24:00, JAMNANDAS is corrupt - i wonder why people think he's clean @makhosi nobhatyi you are right. In fact we should have a Inquiry into all spheres of government instead more and more popping up as we go on. "joooh this is bad Wena Sock you’re playing VBS is bad too power corrupts vhavenda i mani ngamilenzhe kha vbs VBS has nothing to do with EFF. i am not my brother's keeper if I'm floyd shivambu "referring to Blacks

Thats exactly the point I was making. "@TheC4RB1N3 Yes 
1:25:51,1:27:45, David. focus on the enquiry. it's not a party promotion Chat. elections are over GUPTAS FOR PRESIDENT!!!!!!!!! @Anne M. Oh i would too if i could afford her lol dd mabuza for president before end of year True 😃 😎😂😂😂😂 How is that racist please explain "ANC IS NOT THE PROBLEM everything's racist in this country 🙄 
1:28:17,1:29:58, Ramaphosa (a so-called billionaire) took other people's money to buy presidency @Michael Wild I agree we are so off topic and busy with our own agendas please let us listen and make a positive rmark that will help us as a nation forward ask why do we have racism at first then we can have the better discussion now i am forced to say silly goat Goat I have no view on a group like that. give me a name of someone and I will tell you what I feel. EVERYONE IN SA IS RACIST I have no issue with any group. ANC failed us in 1994 when they gave the rupert and the oppernheimer our wealth @I Am Free Mohammed marries an 8 year-old child 
1:30:02,1:31:39, ALLEGATIONS WILL REMAIN ALLEGATIONS some comments are completely of chart and have nothing to do with the enquiry Hassan that true #mindset How did the ANC give Rupert and Openheimer your wealth in 1994 @Minoctar Sithole ? @Michael Wild something is not working in your head for real mzala wealth is land so I ask for a vote. is GOAT comments racial against on group and he should be blocked. it's a democracy we can't be defending corrupt people or corruption!! free speech should triumph 
1:31:42,1:32:41, i am using Michael as an anchor and now you tell me he is not well. Guys were to from here? The state of this country is appalling. All these testimonies are really eye opening to what has being going on. "If ANC is tired running this they must fire Gordhan and wait for results @Michael Wild Yes and so is Kercy Pillay @Granny Mokwena Agree. I also share the DCJ's disbelief in what the HOD did. Land if we dont get things off our chest it just stays bottled up and comes out in worse ways @Minoctar Sithole So our land was given as a gift in 1994 to these people? @Michael Wild They should both apologise 
1:32:45,1:34:30, Zondo getting to the bottom of this✔ 99% of Indians Don't place their parents in old age homes i voted for the DA the premeir got it wrong wrong David it is everyone's business and some comments are very bad. But nobody wants to see these racial comments With ANC we are quickly and surely becoming Zimbabwe-like Here’s Ace Magashule response caught on the wrong side Racists and racial comments are not welcome here 
1:34:37,1:36:12, "Lol does anybody here know patricia de lille was the first one who opened up gov erment coruption when the arms scandel broke "@Goat - That's a baseless accusation So premier Ace Magashule got it wrong? When was Ace ever correct? Ace is a thief of note they got the freedom of selection why don't they look at what is relevant wonder how Advocate Mkhwebane exonerated people on this 1 pp find nothing wrong in this case 
1:36:16,1:37:44, Ace & Zuma plotting behind Zuma ace was and is always corrupt...... oh i spelled it wrong correct Exactly what ZUma claimed was being done to him @david cele nice opinion you got there I voted for DA whilst i was in CT. I lived in Newlands and it DA was working for me. I also made some dubious votes on the National level..because.. @david cele DA doesn't want racists "I am saying "the problem is the moment I start talking about corruption the response is "" yeah you voted for the ANC so shut up""( immediately assuming I'm black and naturally vote ANC or EFF)." sure mr d 
1:38:10,1:39:22, Chairperson is sharp ryan john i wish we were face to face "then others will be like "" yeah you supported apartheid so shut up" me to free should we block ryan now? I just blocked the other one According to @Minoctar Sithole there were no wars of conquest in South Africa to disposes black people of land. All that happened was that the ANC as late as 1994 gave away the land. I have blocked ryan !!! "@Sock ""One South Africa for All"" copied that from their website @Granny Mokwena It shouldn't matter who you vote for. You have a right to speak out about corruption. Corruption affects everyone. 
1:39:27,1:40:54, @ryan john Is jy 'n boks? Vierkant square en ongelooflik dig? both black and white corruption does not have race just people that is not honest "@ryan john Are you not attending your mother @Francois Cape Town 😂 "@Goat. The EFF wants to make the State responsible for dealing land out. How IGN can you trust government to be fair? The elite will get the best but it does @Anne m "@ryan john Yes because whites are culpable "Let us try by all means to not be emotional it shouldn't but it does 
1:40:59,1:41:48, @Sock DA is opposition party which originally stood for free market liberal principles but has since has moved its policies closer to those of ANC in attempt to attract their voters. Hence ANC-LITE. Guys you have lost the plot now! "@david cele can't argue with a fool @Granny Mokwena That's sad "@ryan john You wouldnt measure up to any black woman John your out of order now. Stop your village mentalities I think @ryanjohn is a spy I can tell you that the possibility is probably big that ryan john is a bloody agent trying to agitate the discussion. Keep fighting each other with racist remarks whilst the politicians line their own pockets and control your thoughts. 
1:42:10,1:42:44, hi I'm new Get them Zondo! @michaelthompson you are right! @Michael Thomson 🤛 Racials and racists please go lay wrestling elsewhere @ryan john you are intellectually dwarfy "@ryan john Goat is back. I just blocked him. "Hi New

Just got to be on top "Urgh "I enjoy fasting actually Investigators will be assassinated "@Goat - Depends on if what you're offering me Dit is regtig onsinnig om te sien hoeveel mense bereid is om die verkeerde dade te beskerm.

2:12:24,2:15:44, I’m disgusted by this chat. If you have nothing constructive to ay about the commission then say nothing. This constant racial bickering is childish and repugnant. "freedom:we are free insofar the laws that is basically their to protect property interest and public interest Goat why not just keep the chat nice clean and friendly then there is no harm @Gareth Davies Totally agree. Well said agreed David. Davies @Gareth Davies ... probaby because a lot of the people on this chat are repugnant children 😉 no it will not I worked in many countries. and things can change. it takes hard work but they can get better @Goat - Race divides racists.
