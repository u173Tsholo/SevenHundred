time,0:52,message Morning morning comrades morning morning bathandi bezindaba "Hallo "Morning people Tom Moyane will be granted t cross examine Parrafin the media darling this fools are against Gordon bcz they want to loot 
1:01,6:45, "he should Moyane is implicated with testimony of McBride Moyane is fighting Gordhan "Morning Pravin must Be cross examined just like everyone "parrafin diesnt want to be questioned by public protector "Moyane will be granted to the approval "​Pravin does not want to be questioned by public protector "@Elson Elson I agree with you 
7:47,10:46, morning ..praving must fall "why doesnt he want to be cross examined Gordhan is not going to fall down ngamasela down So.. Pravin doesn't want his version to be cross examined? We must just believe his version as it stands. So Mayane being granted leave to cross examine is political agenda? It’s a fight back by moyane and all of this thieves he cant say things about people and expect it to take it as it is Cross examination its about testing the evidence provided by a witness . The witness must therefore not fear anything if their evidence is true kkkkk Tom must come before the commision before with his evidance before cross examing any one kkkk 
11:10,12:54, Justice must take its course for Fairness to all I'm not sure about fighting for Malema but I want Pravin to be cross-examined. He can't just give his version and go on his merry way. The Commission must be seen to be fair to everyone. @makhosi nobhatyi you maybe right but if gordan is certain his evidence is correct why doesnt he want it to be tested @Pheladi Lamola i agree with you Last night was really devastating with the Notre Dame fire if Parrafin doesnt want to be cross-examined then he must shut his mouth. @Tarisai Kadungure Agreed. "He will come here Let Private Gorhan be cross examined is he superior than any South African 
13:30,15:39, he must appear even in court witnesses are questioned by accused persons "@Nkanyezi Vilakati Same for Moyane @makhosi nobhatyi i fully agree with you but it doesnt mean Gordaan shouldnt be cross examined "But friends "@Amanda Watson  Private Gorhan must fall together with his Cabal and Stratcom crew👇👇👇👇 Moyane destroyed SARS..the Nugent Commission was clear Justice account to law not to individuals or political parties so justice must prevail in this particular instance. "Carnoth ngomane 
16:24,18:02, The issue is not that Gordan refuse to be cross examined but that Dali Mpofu want to bring issue rogue unit which was not part of the Pravin evidence I did not know there could be anything suspicious about Prav...who has since posed as Mr Tell IT All So whether Pravin is cross examined or not it must be by the law nothing more nothing less "The rule says for you to cross examine any witness "@makhosi nobhatyi Ghordan implicated moyane on his testimony and he should be cross examined Someone says something somebody doesn't like then it's stratcom instead of interrogating what it is you don't like. It's the supreme bullshit argument. Just get to the verdict chief I concur with u @Nelson Musoliwa let justice prevail Moyane in his bid to cross examine Gordhan also raises new questions which were never alleged at the commission but at different points in his interraction with Gordhan 
18:21,21:04, "Moyane was a puppet of Zuma @Amanda Watson Interrogating is what is being sought to be archived but Pravin does not want that he must come to give his testimony first before he eximine others "The do called 'rogue unit' never existed.The EFF is fuelling this against Gordhan The truth is that Dali want to use the commission to bring the Rogue unit and discredit Pravin evidence Moyane fought time and again to stay relevant...he is heavily implicated in state capture Did Moyane give a statement for him to want to cross examine Pravin? "@Eslon Eslon  @Eslon Eslon if Ghordan's testimony if legit there is no way in which they will discredit it. My question is why doesnt he want to be cross examined? 
21:07,24:28, "No He even sent his lawyers to testify for him at the Nugent commission "Without any statement from Tom if Ghordan's testimony is credible then it should be open for cross examination. Dali Mpofu came across very unprofessional at the Commission here..revisit it on YouTube. Moyane has no evidence rather than Rogue unit which was dismissed many times by NPA and ssa Granted or not ? "@carnoth "Moyane cries is baseless coz he is guilty 
24:36,27:01, "The Gupta tried the same thing it is all about continuing with looting @Eslon Eslon thats true but it doesnt mean Ghordan mustn't be cross examined Today a SARS employee is facing disciplinary who gave the Guptas R460m VAT return ordered by Moyane..she will probably lose her job too.The payments were made via third parties its seems Parrafin is very powerful If Pravin Gordan is cross examined his lies will be exposed What lies? @Nkanyezi Vilakati INDEED "@Elson 
27:07,29:23, @Quintin Jacobs 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Mark my word the eff will noise if Zondo refuse to grant the cross examination but @Nkanyezi Vilakati Mr. Joshua Doore has powerful and influential friends yes EFF have to protect the looters bcz they are the champs in looting And they will use Adv. Mxolisi Zondo to discerdit DCJ. @goolamv Stop exposing your exposing your stupidity "The EFF will use Judge Zondo's brother excuse if it is denied "I will defend those who stand here to speak the truth nothing but the truth @Funicanz Exactly 
29:54,33:06, "the rules of the commission are clear "@Magda Seguin It seems @Nkanyezi Vilakati has inside information Chair the ruling is too long @Musa Bakiti 😂😂 "I am extremely concerned about the EFF @Amanda he didn't answer my question...it does "Should Chair deny this application Moyane has not given his version and yet waist money on applying for Leave to Cross Examine a witness. He must have a lot of cash to throw around? Malema is a dictator in the making 
33:12,34:55, 🏃🏃 wow Zondo gonna say NO "@Magda Seguin  I see a deny here. leave to cross examine mr paraffin gordan is denied Parrafin dodge another bullet Zondo is also uncle Tom mos... he is Edi AMIN even his comrade in EFF are scared of him a dictator of note "lol 
34:56,36:35, Moyane must first tell us he accept or denied allegations put by mr Gordhan Moyane must first provide his own version and then apply for leave to cross examine Pravin Another waste of money by Tom Moyane @funicanz what about the militarization of the EFF? It reminds me of Idi Amin Guys remember the eff was here the day Pravin appeared and attack the commission "leave the eff alone Dali must give Monyane his money back we dont REALLY DONT Care how you feel about CIC hopefully the Public Proctector is scared of Parrafin and his cabal 
36:43,38:54, the fact that Pravin's Lawyers are not here shows tgwy know the verdict Seserthembe PP may she can deal with the untouchable Gordan decisively Dali mpofu is being bought by EFF to do their dirty job he is loosing every case They may even invade the venue that's their style WE DONT CARE incompetent Dali Mpofu and Mabuza blah blah blah blah I always remind people that Malema was 12 years old when Masina was released from prison.His mentor was Peter Mokaba of 'kill the Boer fame *Madiba 
39:10,40:30, Dali is angry also coz he loose his Job 😃😃😃 All Moyane has is smoke from the charred ashes of his career as a state capturer-in-chief Zondo is captured EFF will never get anywhere GET TO THE POINT ZONDO "@Magda Seguin ... let's leave it there. We might just find ourselves blocked @Quintin Jacobs Prove it. @funicanz you are right A knowledgeable law practitioner would know how broad the defectives are in an application for leave to cross examined a witness to avoid clutching on a straw. 
40:38,43:05, "@Quintin Jacobs  Zondo and the Cabal crew have dis-legitimized the commission @Nkanyezi Vilakati​ Zondo and the Cabal crew have dis-legitimized the commission @Amanda Watson so why cant Parrafin not be cross examine Shhhh @Quintin Jacobs The Judge is literally telling you right now PG must be cross examine Zondo using Nugent what about the KPMG rapport of the Rogue Unit Moyane must be arrested @LonwaboLloyd Miggels never Parrafin is squeeky clean 
43:26,44:31, Zondo is having overtime to justify why the Paraffin price should not be reduced so that our people can have access to it😂😂😂😂 Whoever wants to cross examine Pravin must first state their version I think most people fail 2 distinguish Mpofu as an advocate nd Eff chairperson. Its very premature to try nd link Mpofu's profession nd EFF.I believe he doesn't get any mandate from EFF on this case. blah blah spinning spinning "My assumption Mpofu is a member of the EFF executive if he is why he is afraid to be cross examine Again gained Huge respect for the DCJ. He is a just man and our Country needs more like him. Time wasted. 
44:46,47:03, "@Magda Seguin  Its public fact that Parrafin used the Rogue Unit to get dirt on his enemies @funicanz yes... Did he? @Quintin Jacobs Please provide links? @funicanz unfortunately that's exactly what McBride did the past few days @Quintin Jacobs Give us one example. Moyane does not dispute or deny Gordhan's allegations.... Those asking why PG does not want to be cross-examined or impugning the credibility of the commission are not paying attention to the judgment being delivered by DCJ Zondo because it is boring "@ funicanz yes I can agree with you 
47:05,49:36, Moyane is running from court to court and commission to commission wasting our time @Bophelo Malapela true dali is daily "black people slamming black elderly leaders idiotic. I know moyane personally and if yall did @goolamv Can't blame the lawyer for his clients shortcommings. @goolamv i guess you are a great one hey. hence u hv time to post on you tube "Moyane "as a lawyer one can't keep defending hopeless cases "Let us all defend the truth 
49:55,51:40, "Granting leave to cross-examine where warranted is not giving in to childish fights where did moyane do corruption? @makhosi nobhatyi Great comment! @goolamv true. Sloppy work done. But Tom will still have to pay Adv Dali "Zondo Must I spell it out? SARS @Keatlarese Breaking News!The applicant's leave to cross examine Mr Paraffin Gordyn is hereby denied (dismissed) ZONDO trying hard to read judgement written at stellengbosch... @Magda Seguin so true and the Adv is making money 
51:42,52:56, What at SARS Magda? "For as long as we won't entertain those who won't agree with the judgement and encourage the commission to move on Or are you refering to allegations just like those levelled against Ghodarn? """Kick the dog so hard until it owners comes out"" LONG LIVE CIC" @Magda Seguin the lawyer is making money. Who is footing the bills for TM's lawyer? He doing a botched job. Agree @funicanz Judgment written in the same stellenboch where Floyd shivhambu went to look for business partners? "We want all of the executives who are implicated to accounts to the nation by saying his or her version known by the country Zondo is drinking his second bottle of water in less than 45 minutes. Why? 
53:17,54:47, @Bothell spot on @Wandile Wiseprince 😆 @Keatlaretse Phetwe Arread Aree justices not obliged to read their judgements? this application is childish @Keatlareste if you dint know SARS you must be a cyberbot His thirsty The Zondo madala will finish 10L trying to announce that the application is denied My point @Yvonne Morudu "Magda 
54:48,56:14, that's too much water for sure lol @Jacob Zuma Blocking a few people who trigger nonsense Moyane was suppose to first present his version to the commission b4 applying to cross examine Pravin @Nkanyezi Vilakati Just for you I hope he drinks 11litres and not just 10. Kuzakushuba @Jacob Zuma... "@Magda Seguin  These statements made by moyane was uttered by eff so he can with these nonsense We know who follow this commission religiously and we skip their comments due to those that feels this is a playground. 
56:18,57:51, Black people hating their own... @Norman Zwane 😂😂😂😂😂 Thanks @funicanz And he and his advocate know that @Eslon Eslon "Parrafin leaks affidavits and subpoenas to cabal media to get media ""sympathy""" Malume @Jacob Zuma Ulapha? "Finish ZONDO what this people want from Gordan let them pay tax there protector gone(moyane). The race card....when all else fails 
58:01,59:10, AFRICAN PEOPLE.. ROGUE UNIT... An internal audit report claims to show a R4.3bn loss at @TreasuryRSA while under the stewardship of Parrafin. this has nothing to do about black people There was no rogue unit @Quintin Jacobs how much do they pay you to troll? "Form of state capture????Thats Tom's version @Thando Nkutha Gordhan is no Angel but I guess even small devils fera the devil incarnate - one Tom Moyane Treasury gets its money from Sars so.... 
59:16,1:00:30, @Amanda Watson is that fact wow than all the reports We'll hear from public protector Watson.. who came up with the word Rogue unit Quinton Jacobs please don’t just come up with baseless accusations @what? im no troll im after justice and im anti corruption so if a person is anti Parrafin then you a troll wow bwahahahaha @Keatlaretse Phetwe too much of funny "Is this Adv Dali Mpofu's incompetence? Why did he not comply to the requirements? Point out the point of contention & offer an alternative view We are in this mess becauss of ANC 
1:00:56,1:02:14, "@ofhie Muofhe ""Rogue""? I'd ask the guys who came here in 1652. We were fine before then "All this shame is for @Quintin Jacobs do you support Moyane? by Africans thank you Zwane... @Norman Zwane lols right. Mzilikazi Wa Afrika must have nightmares for falling for the 'rogue unit' scam...he was used to publish hogwash which brought the Sunday Times into disrepute.The Cato Manor story too. "@Sindiswa mzalwane "@Thando Nkutha  
1:02:16,1:03:12, "The PP investigation is based on retracted media reports @what? if Tom is guilty of corruption I SAY he must rot in jail with hard labour mphofu and mabuza don't read they are being exposed for their foolishness rogue unit create an understanding that the unit was not reporting to anyone. @Amanda Watson please stop trolling Pravin's lawyers left in the morning just before Zondo started with judgement Interesting.... "The counyry is borrowing billions a month Why cant the simply ask for a boxing ring then we all watch who is more powerful. This is silent war and is fought through laws and media etc. The question is..what is the prize? I think Mpofu is a quota player in this field. Just my view. 
1:03:18,1:05:05, "@Amanda Watson  Moyane never opens his mouth...he uses his lawyers to speak for him hence Mpofu will do the bidding for him "@Eslon Eslon That is the long version of this pathetic application. Short version "@Quintin Jacobs I didn't realise putting forward facts was trolling SO MOYANE IS NOT IMPLICATED! looks like some people are here for work purpose vote eff alone its fine Media is very interesting We are still waiting for the PP to produce the outcome of Estina Dairy invedtigation 
1:05:11,1:05:46, We are all correct as we type any nonsense @Tshepho Kekana Moyane ukopa ispeech esingamfuni Moyane ask for your money back from Dali Mpofu in South Africa a mother steals a loaf of bread and is hastily sentence to 10 years but if a politician or white collar criminal steals its 1st suspension then a commission. higher court then appeals whether its a book or a simply tweet...we are correct looks like Mr Moyane will loose his application to cross examine "Eish Moyane is pathetic @Magda Seguin The PP released a report on Estina "The DCJ should in summary call Dhali out for poor representation and advice to his client in as far as reasonable prospects for succes to cross examine. Alas 
1:05:57,1:07:06, #Asijiki EFF ifikile Dali Mpofu is weak and useless @Quintin Jacobs who stole a loaf of bread and went to jail for 10years "@Vuyo Ngewu Mpofu will advise him to go to the Concourt DCJ has been reading for more than an hour.

1:08:28,1:09:56, "Shivambu brother Brian is trouble to the amount of R5.5m he borrowed from VBS "@Quintin Jacobs - it is the law I for one have no trust in the PP "eff challenges ""white monopoly capital"" by helping to steal a whole bank" I am aslo suspicious of this PP She does not represent the public...why is she also hunting down Gordhan? hahahaha that's a new one! DJZ your boring now. this is not a book reading What is PP 
1:09:58,1:11:31, whats race capture? Public Protector Race capture???????? @funicanz - thank you. My brain is dead today My honest advice is people must stayaway from the ANC She wants to question Gordhan on the old 27 questions that the NPA sent to him after he was sacked by Zuma @Madelein Huxtable they can cause THEY HAVE MONEY "And with that "I for one i am not captured  
1:11:31,1:12:46, I wish eff loose more support if you have money you ARE ABOVE THE LAW case in point Steinhoff saga they surely will loose a lot """our race is captured"" 🤣" DA is a better devil of the two i agree with you "that's why I will never be fooled by EFF i saw Julius say he would form a new party with the ANC "A lot of people still haven't decided who they are voting for. I know I have to vote Gordhan know all laws at sars and treasury

1:52:45,1:57:36, @Thando Nkutha I personally think McBride wanted to use the opportunity to air his grievances but there was some worthwhile testimony. "Read the analysis in the Daily Maverick...McBride opened a Pandoras box of corrupt *deceipt I personally have a renewed respect for Mcbride. agree wit@Magda Seguin so people in the chat are failing to to read McBride and what he is telling the Commission. He opened the pandora box "@Thando Nkutha If you missed yesterday's evidence "These people where able to translate the bible to every African language but they cant translate academic books to Sepedi @For Ever Young I don't see Magda Seguin comments.

Imagine from Judges to Ministers no one whose genuine. stream must be a debate at Parlamant nothing will solve we as And bribery is rife @Sibonakaliso Gumede Unfortunately not much debating happens at parliament - it's a circus. "there all swimming in corruption 
2:13:14,2:16:50, @Thando Nkutha Ya man @Thando Nkutha Hey! I'm doing all of those so I must be alright. 😃 "O’Sulluvane the eff target 😳😳🤪🤪 system even at Parlamant is the same. Corruption is OUR trandition "it's time to set very high jail time for any corruption. no matter who Cele made SAPS a quasi military outfit when he was police minister the first time now we have 'general's who never fought in a war @Michael Wild I'd go for chopping off a hand. or heads waisting time and money 
2:17:07,2:21:18, When transnet coming? it's will go till next year nothing will be achieved lets grow SA 2gather its has been a sad story to our young generation Deep rot happened one day is going to be in.volve also 🤣🤣 This evidence is truly nasueauting and shocking. shameful. the planned desttrucion of the law enfocrement servics is horrendous when are we expecting the eff press conference to attack and accuse the commission of protecting Pravin and his cabals Corruption is OUR Culture "@Sibonakaliso Gumede we should never lose hope @David Hotz .... it's not horrendous.... it's TREASON 
2:21:45,2:24:47, @Eslon Eslon😄 We must do like China i wonder which fool is going 2b arrested after dis commission..... @Thando Nkutha there is no point in engaing with yoiiu. I can see your thread. you have come to dissemble. Your comments i can see add nothing but to obfuscate and prevaricate. pathetic. We have recent examples of how people made a change peacefully: Sudan and Algeria If you are corruption at Chine you face fireing squed "@Magda Seguin... Please don't laugh @David Hotz I blocked Thando Nkutha ages ago I know @Eslon Eslon point taken 
2:26:48,2:31:16, This is like Spy vs Spy in the MAD magazine 😃 When last did you use that yellow ruler "The detail of McBride' s testimony is phenomenal This is like DD chasing Supra calling him thief @Robert Russell... What do u mean by spy vs spy? I wish I kept my MAD magazines from my younger days @Robert Russell "@Eslon Eslon Ever piicked up a 'MAD"" magazine?" Yeah they were really great Magda I should have done the same why do I feel like Mcbride's testimony needs a higher arena than this commission? 
2:31:19,2:39:05, CIS and IPID were ate each other's throat instead of providing services to the nation which is tantamount to treason. all very high ranked officers. first question is how did they get all the high ranks. its handed out like smarties nowadays. @Eslon Eslon I agree I hope Shamila Batohi start the prosecutions with this section of the commission...she has huge interest in cleaning out her backyard @Elson i concur with u this testimonies is highly complicated "@Nelson Musoliwa State resources being used to sort out personal scores @Norman Zwane not wished for... actively planned and exectured. M Thamm hightighted some evidence yesterday. shows th e trends of destruction of enforcement. see her FB thread. @Norman you can say that again this is one of the major causes that collapsed the state McBride may also be guilty of taking his battles to the commission. The thread of fabricating testimony in exchange for jobs is nonetheless correctly located here. Goodness!Israel? They have the most sophisticated spyware...the new phone spying device cost millions.The Saudi government used it on Kashoggi 
2:40:22,2:50:46, The Saudis spied on Kashoggi and his whereabouts and consequently killed him brutally in the Turkish Saudi embassy. @Nelson Musoliwa There were enough greedy people to fight for positions and forget about their principal task. Zuma only needed dangle a carrot for the infighting to commence. "No personal battles "Mcbride's evidence is highly complicated that it needs a bench of few judges to ventilate it not only Zondo and Pretorius The Smarties handed out Patronage is a strong word to use Time to review all ranks and how they got them "McBride's evidence is complicated Plz proof the patronage you're referring to Mr. Mcbride 
2:50:49,2:55:22, SAPS should do away with military nomenclature...they are servants of the people not the army "I think there's more in Mcbride's evidence and it needs a thorough examination Long theory speech that makes sense but some evidence would come in handy "This is how you collapse state institutions for state capture "I can't imagine that DCJ Zondo has to sit analyze Zuma shuffled his government on a regular basis...always at night.I think it was 9 or 11 times...every time someone new came in things were changed.The newcomers were Gupta state capture choices Brilliantly explained by McBride @Eslon Eslon he has a supportive investigative team. The evidence being led by pretorius isnot all the infomration that gets considered. I suggest you read the terms of the establ of the commission. @madga .100% 
2:55:25,3:01:10, "He has not yet been reimbursed by the state for using his own money in defense of the Republic "@i feel so because whenever Mcbride bring up sme juicy topic Pretorius will often say it will be discussed in due cos @nyiko nyiko thanks "@carnoth ngomane... Imagine Zondo has to sit alone analyze @Eslon Eslon its already a huge task water that two bottles The rot in state was too deep as Robert is explaining here can we please put him. in the new scorpions 2.0 🙏🏾🙏🏾 "@carnoth ngomane  
3:01:19,3:06:46, He has already been made Head of the Parliamentary Integrity Committee by CR...if the Zuma faction get rid of CR we are again in the same boat @David Hotz Exactly Why adjourn if you will take a long adjournment at 13:00? "McBride Needs the bathroom how depressing to hear Mcbrides opinion of the SAPS. @David Hotz i know all that but energy thereof is lacking and some evidence from are left hanging with further questions This commission was suppose to have two three judges along side Zondo plus evidence leaders to exact more infos from witnesses instead of two people exploring facts from witnesses "This so refreshing unlike the officers and ministers of the white minority government of apartheid 
3:08:32,3:15:29, "@Eslon Eslon The word ""patronage"" is not strong enough for what's happened here - it's outright criminality." "Ndim do you always need to bring back the past. this is related to bad management "The outcome was always no one is responsible "African Refugee "Mahumapelo province working with premier league to defend JZ @Ndim Mavuks Take a look at how your glorious movement treats anyone with integrity eg. McBride. The ANC is now a cabal of criminals. "The ANC as an organisation never dealt with McBride Let alone the fact McBride never accused the ANC of anything here @Ndim Mavuks His evidence here is laying bare how the ANC cadres treated him. 
3:15:54,3:20:20, What an indictment on Zuma government!! "@Ndim Mavuks to some people ANC is a phobia Cadres on whose instruction All the decisions were made at the Gupta shebeen @Thami Ngwenya That we have yet to find out. But there was no protection for him from the ANC either. @Thando Nkutha I agree with that but it's not an either-or. "Exactly Thando Thin line between the party and government. C omission should look at that 
3:21:16,3:26:22, @Thami there was no line..just party interest "When De Lille called for an open public disciplinary hearing LOOK AT PARTY INTEREST AND GOVERNMENT IS A PROBLEM NOT LIMITED TO ANC Mcbride is somehow intelligent So many names implicated "And Honour him with everything he did pre and post apartheid @Thami the last time I looked the ANC is the governing party and they have the majority vote.Time and again the opposition parties complained the the ANC executive has no accountability. In the land of the blind.... the cyclops is king.... sounds like you and the ANC.... @Ndim Mavuks Eslon he is intelligent not somehow
