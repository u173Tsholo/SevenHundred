She said she’s a whistleblower but she’s busy covering up the tsotsis....shame on her Mr. Richard Seleke's CV was brought in by Duduzane Zuma 😂🤷🤣 
1:52:30,1:54:15, @Thabo Mokoaleli TSOTSIS OF FREE STASE She looks very nervous I agree she makes it feel like she is more guilty than being a whistleblower "All these people that they are mentioning are watching this live right now  she likes face values Damning testimony though.

Where is the info? Maybe she also got a fat slice of pie Face value se moer man @Owen Nyilika 😂🙆🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ It's still not quite cut and dry... Who's businessman? 🤔 So they all had the same password for the email address? Nkosi Sikelela Africa....... @ Ms G did you hear Chair 😄 
1:59:13,2:01:19, 😃She speaks in circles now You know its firing when chairperson is calling the whales Sy praat in sirkels It is plausible that the “businessman” email was a shared address accessible only by those who had a common purpose. "Mandela vra die Land 😃 Is n storie nou wat nie gaan end nie Tebogo obviously because you cannot have details of an email you have nothing to do with "@Fred Desrosiers - she could have been a ""prescribed officer"" in terms of the Companies Act" @wim louw - jy lieg LOL - dis Jan Van Riebeeck wat opgemors het 368 jaar gelede. 🙂 
2:01:24,2:04:06, "Why did Adv Seleka smile after saying ""You need to sanitize it"" for 5 Marks 😂🤣😂" 😅😅 @Saresa Myburgh ...Verduidelik..? @Thobani Mkananda Because 🙂 It is an obvious that the so called businessman has always been Mr. Saleem Essa and Miss.

The advocate for President brilliant indeed Not sure if someone has noticed or said this; the Advocate’s mannerisms and accent is similar to Tyson Ngubeni ( comedian on the Chicken Licken advert) 😅 @ Gift I agree. she is supposed to be whistleblowing but she is fihlaing 
2:04:21,2:06:29, .....some of my best friends are Black... well done Adv Seleka 👏👏👏 10-0 agree.... Now she is singing like a canary last kick of the dying horse It is obvious that the so called business man has always been Sallem Essa. Ben Ngubane knew this ans so did Miss.
